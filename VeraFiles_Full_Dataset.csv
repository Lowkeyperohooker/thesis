"A statement attributed to Sen. Risa Hontiveros is going viral online, claiming she called the youth who died during a Jan. 1 clash between the military and the New People’s Army (NPA) in Occidental Mindoro a “real hero.” This is fake. Hontiveros has debunked the claim on her official Facebook page. No credible reports confirm that the Senate deputy majority leader made such a remark, based on a keyword search on Google. Originally published by an FB page on Jan. 4, the fake quote card bore a picture of Hontiveros along with her supposed statement that read: “ANG TUNAY NA BAYANI AY ANG MGA NAMATAY NA KABATAAN SA MINDORO HINDI ANG SUNDALO. DAHIL SILA ANG NAKIKIBAKA SA KABATAAN PARA PUMUNTA SA BUNDOK (The real heroes are the young people who died in Mindoro, not the soldiers because they are the ones who struggle with the youth to go to the mountains.)” Other users and pages republished the graphic with untrue claims from Jan. 5 to 6, including former broadcaster Jay Sonza, whose previous claims have been repeatedly fact-checked by VERA Files. In a Jan. 8 FB post, the senator labeled the quote card “fake news,” urging the public not to believe “the lies being circulated.” Some red flags The bogus quote card has several red flags, including the lack of citations from verifiable sources and the reference to Hontiveros as a “representative.” A reverse image search shows that the photo of Hontiveros used in the Jan. 4 fabricated quote card was taken from her old interview on journalist Christian Esguerra’s podcast published on Aug. 5, 2025. Another version of the graphic, posted on Jan. 6, used Hontiveros’ picture taken during the June 26, 2024 legislative inquiry on convicted former Bamban, Tarlac Mayor Alice Guo’s alleged links with Philippine offshore gaming operators. PLM student slain in AFP-NPA clash The fabricated quote card surfaced three days after what the Armed Forces of the Philippines described as “a legitimate intelligence-driven mission against communist terrorist group leaders” in Occidental Mindoro, which resulted in the death of a Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila student. On the other hand, the National Democratic Front of the Philippines confirmed the death of Jerlyn Rose Doydora, Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education Major in English from PLM, who “succumbed to an illness during the period of intensified aerial bombardment and ground assaults in the area.” Doydora “was among the youth who expressed the desire to interview the indigenous people and farmers in Mindoro and the [NPA] Red fighters,” the NDF-Mindoro said in a separate statement. The post by FB user Para Sa Pilipino (created on Oct. 5, 2025) has so far garnered 5,100 reactions, 3,100 comments and 237 shares.

"May Facebook page na nagsasabing lalaya na raw sa pagkakadetena sa International Criminal Court si dating pangulong Rodrigo Duterte dahil sa resulta ng medical exam na ginawa ng “ICC chief medical officer”. Peke ito. Noong Dec. 6 ay kinumpirma ng abogado ni Duterte na si Nicholas Kaufman na “the defense has been provided with the reports of the court-appointed panel of experts (binigyan sila ng medical results galing sa mga ekspertong pinili ng ICC).” Pero inilinaw niyang “confidential” o hindi isinasapubliko ang medical result. Ang pekeng quote card ay ini-upload noong Dec. 3, dalawang araw bago ang deadline ng ICC para makompleto ang mga ekspertong titingin sa kondisyon ni Duterte. Ayon sa quote card, sinabi raw ni “ICC chief medical officer Dr. Steven Wolfe” na: “After examining former President Rodrigo Duterte, I confirm that he is experiencing advanced symptoms of Ligma Degenerative Syndrome (LDS), a condition causing cardiovascular instability, limited mobility, and rapid stress-related deterioration. Given his age and the progression of LDS, continued ICC detention poses serious medical risks and will likely worsen his condition. He requires a stable, familiar environment that cannot be provided within the facility. For humanitarian and medical reasons, I strongly recommend his immediate release. It would be in his best interest to spend Christmas in Davao with his family, where emotional support and reduced stress can help stabilize his health.” (Sa check-up ko kay pangulong Duterte, nakumpirmang nakararanas siya ng malalang sintomas ng LDS o sakit na nagdudulot ng komplikasyon sa puso, mahirap na paggalaw at mabilisang paghina dahil sa pagod. Dahil sa katandaan ni Duterte at paglala ng LDS, nanganganib siya kung patuloy siyang nakadetena sa ICC. Kailangan niya ng pamilyar na lugar na hindi nabibigay ng ICC. Para sa makatao at pangkalusugang dahilan, mariin kong inirerekomenda ang agaran niyang paglaya. Ikabubuti ng kalusugan niya kung magpa-Pasko siya sa Davao, kasama ang pamilya niyang susuportahan siya.) Hanggang nitong Dec. 8 ay hindi isinasapubliko ng ICC ang medical result ni Duterte. Binuo ng ICC ang grupo ng iba’t ibang eksperto sa pag-iisip para tingnan ang kakayanan ni Duterte na harapin ang korte. Natapos ang pagbuo ng grupo noong Nov. 14, pagtapos palitan ang dalawang eksperto. Mga palatandaang peke ang quote card: Ang quote card ay ini-upload limang araw pagtapos hindi payagan ng ICC ang pakiusap na pansamantalang makalaya si Duterte. Ang quote card ay ini-upload ng FB page na Duterte Supporter Daily News (ginawa noong March 24, 2025) at may lagpas 27,000 reactions, 12,000 shares at 4,300 comments. Aminado ang Duterte Supporter Daily News na ang page ay para sa katuwaan lang.

"Kumakalat ang mga pekeng quotes ni US President Donald Trump na susunduin si dating pangulong Rodrigo Duterte sa International Criminal Court sa Netherlands matapos dakpin ng US ang pangulo ng bansang Venezuela. Simula January 5 ay may Facebook pages at users na nagbabahagi nitong dalawang quote card na may picture ni Trump at sagisag ng United States President: “Like what I did to Venezuelan President Maduro, I will do to Former President Rodrigo Duterte. My troops are ready to pick him up from the ICC Detention Center. I stand with my friend from the Philippines, he did nothing wrong. I’ll have to rescue him whatever it takes. ICC is unfair and unjust, I’ll missile Duterte out. I’ll bring him home!” (Ang ginawa ko sa pangulo ng Venezuela ay gagawin ko rin kay dating pangulong Rodrigo Duterte. Susunduin siya sa ICC ng mga sundalo ko. Pinapanigan ko ang kaibigan kong si Duterte mula sa Pilipinas na walang ginawang masama. Ililigtas ko siya anumang mangyari. Hindi patas at hindi makatarungan ang ICC. Pauuwiin ko si Duterte!) “If there’s one thing I believe, it’s standing by allies. President Duterte led his country his way, and I respect that. I will use every diplomatic channel available to help ensure that FPRRD is treated fairly and to push for his release from the ICC. Strong leaders deserve strong support.” (Naniniwala ako sa pagtulong sa mga kakampi. Nirerespeto kong may sariling paraan si Duterte sa pamumuno. Gagawin ko ang lahat ng puwedeng pakikipag-usap para siguruhing tinatrato nang tama si Duterte, at isusulong ko ang paglaya niya sa ICC. Kailangan ng malalakas na lider ng malakas na suporta.) Peke ang dalawang quotes na ito. Walang sinabi si Trump tungkol sa pagkakadetena ni Duterte sa Netherlands at mga kaso niya sa ICC. May ibang isyu ang US laban sa ICC, gaya ng pagkompronta ng US sa ilang ICC judges. Pero wala itong kinalaman sa pagkakadetena ni Duterte sa ICC. Wala ring post tungkol sa pekeng quotes ang mga social media account ni Trump o mga official channel ng White House at US Embassy sa Pilipinas. Ang mga pekeng quotes ay pinakalat dalawang araw matapos dakpin ng US at dalhin sa New York ang pangulo ng Venezuela para harapin ang maraming kaso ng terorismo, korapsyon at ilegal na droga. Dalawang araw din pagtapos dakpin ang pangulo ng Venezuela, nag-post ng open letter ang dating anti-corruption commissioner ni Duterte na si Greco Belgica, na nakikiusap kay Trump na tulungang mapauwi si Duterte.

"There’s no let-up in the avalanche of fake, false, and misleading posts in social media rivalling in viciousness to the mysterious COVID-19. Since Solicitor General Jose Calida filed the quo warranto petition against ABS-CBN February 10, the DDS trolls intensified and became more active during the Senate hearing on the leading broadcast media’s franchise which is set to expire May 4. One of the posts that was shared over 6,600 times and could have reached more than 3.3 million social media users was a false quote card attributed to ABS-CBN president and chief executive officer Carlo Katigbak, who testified during the Senate hearing. A fact check by VERA Files showed that “FB page Noel Landero Sarifa, named after its owner who describes himself as a ‘Dutertard’ or supporter of President Rodrigo Duterte in his About page, posted on Feb. 25 an image of Katigbak juxtaposed with text that read: “‘Netflix and YouTube are foreign owned. Why are they being allowed in the Philippines?’ – Carlo Katigbak ABS-CBN CEO.” The post claims the statement — enclosed in quotation marks — was made directly by the television network executive. False. Katigbak did not make the statement being attributed to him. When many netizens called him out for his false post, Sarifa merely said, “the quote was a meme base (sic) on my (his) understanding.” Top sharers of the post were to “Jail Noynoy Aquino” and public FB group President Rody Duterte Facebook Arm. Read VERA Files’ Fact check on this post here: It looks like the pro-Duterte groups do not have the monopoly ofonline disinformation. VERA Files fact checked a quote card attributed to Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go saying “‘Eh ‘di bigyan natin ng Civil Service Eligibility ang mga (Then let us give Civil Service Eligibility to) Chinese workers to replace those whining government employees. I will propose that to the President.’” The quote card, which was beside the senator’s photo used in his column in the broadsheet The Daily Tribune, carried the attribution: “Bong Go, Senator of the Republic of the PHILIPPINES speaking on behalf of Chinese nationals.” VERA Files’s search yielded no such quote from the senator, who is known as the person closest to President Duterte. The fake quote card on Go made the rounds three days after his statement was published on the Senate website. News about BI employees grabbed the headlines after the agency, during a Feb. 17 Senate hearing on online gaming operations, was accused of corruption by systematically allowing easy entry of Chinese nationals into the country in exchange for money. The bribery is now known as the pastillas scheme, describing the way money is wrapped in paper like milk candy. FB page Confeermed’s fabricated quote card already got almost 5,600 FB interactions, and could have reached around 755,000 netizens.

"The Department of Justice says it has not received any affidavit from Henry Alcantara, former chief of the Bulacan first district engineering office, retracting his earlier claims that he paid kickbacks to lawmakers linked to anomalous flood control projects. That assertion may be accurate as a matter of record. It does not, however, settle questions raised by reports that such a recantation exists. Whether formally submitted as part of the preliminary investigation or circulating outside official channels, the reported affidavit, if it exists, adds uncertainty to an already complex inquiry into alleged multibillion-peso corruption in flood control projects. Instead of clarifying matters, it underscores the need for greater transparency and procedural clarity in how the investigation is being conducted and communicated. “For the record, the DOJ has not received or reviewed any affidavit from Henry Alcantara retracting his previous statements,” said the department’s spokesperson, Undersecretary Polo Martinez, responding to media reports that such a document was submitted on Jan. 5. Martinez added that there has been “no official recantation, written or verbal,” of Alcantara’s testimony regarding anomalous, substandard and ghost flood control projects in Bulacan. Yet reports describe a Jan. 5 affidavit in which Alcantara allegedly denies authorizing, participating in, or benefiting from ghost projects, claiming there is no evidence or witness directly linking him to irregular payouts, falsified reports or procurement violations. If authentic, that account stands in clear tension with his earlier sworn statements. In his Sept. 23 testimony before the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, Alcantara identified legislators who he said benefited from kickbacks drawn from flood control funds. He testified that P150 million was delivered to an aide of Sen. Joel Villanueva, while also saying the senator was unaware that the money allegedly came from a flood control project. The distinction may matter legally, but the contradiction between the testimony and the reported recantation is material and cannot be brushed aside. The context in which the supposed retraction surfaced further complicates matters. The report originated from the senator’s legal camp after they submitted on the same date a counter-affidavit filed with the DOJ in response to a graft complaint. Villanueva’s lawyer has also said they have three witnesses who will contest Alcantara’s allegations. This does not invalidate the claim of a retraction. It does, however, highlight how legal strategy, media narratives and investigative processes can intersect in ways that blur, rather than sharpen, the search for facts. Such complications are not new in high-profile corruption cases. Delayed filings, conflicting affidavits and uncertainty over what has been officially received often become part of the landscape. Over time, these dynamics risk shifting attention away from the substance of the allegations and toward procedural disputes that benefit no one except those hoping public interest will dissipate. Beyond the specifics of this case, the episode points to longstanding vulnerabilities in the country’s flood control program. For decades, certain types of projects, such as dredging, desilting and underground drainage, have been particularly susceptible to abuse because they are difficult to inspect once completed. Even more visible structures, including river walls, pumping stations and floodgates, have faced allegations of substandard work, non-completion, or non-implementation. The scale of the problem is no longer in doubt. The Department of Public Works and Highways, with assistance from the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police, has identified at least 421 ghost projects nationwide involving vast sums of public money. These findings underscore the magnitude of the challenge facing investigators, and the stakes involved in getting the process right. In cases of this scale, attempts to muddy the record are not incidental. They are a predictable response by those with the most to lose. Confusion over affidavits, timelines and sworn statements can slow investigations, weaken cases and erode public confidence long before any issue reaches a courtroom. At this stage, the priority should be straightforward. All claims, counterclaims and alleged retractions must be fully disclosed, properly documented and tested through established legal processes. If a recantation exists, it should be authenticated and evaluated. If it does not, that, too, should be made clear, decisively and transparently. Accountability depends not only on uncovering wrongdoing but also on conducting investigations that are coherent, credible and insulated from manipulation. Leaving critical questions in a gray zone risks undermining both the pursuit of justice and public trust in institutions tasked with upholding it.

"May pinakakalat na quote card na sinabi raw ng DTI secretary Cristina Roque na puwede namang magsardinas kaysa mag-ham sa noche buena. Peke ito. Walang patunay ang mga nag-post ng quote card. Hindi ito sinabi ng sekretarya o ng kahit sino sa Department of Trade and Industry. Hindi rin ito ibinalita ng kahit anong mapagkakatiwalaang media. Ini-upload noong Dec. 8 ang picture ng DTI secretary na may hawak na de-latang sardinas at may nakasulat na: “KUNG PWEDE NAMAN KAYO MAG SARDINAS SA NOCHE BUENA BAKIT PA KAYO MAG HA-HAM? KALABISAN NA YUN! – DTI SEC CRISTINA ROQUE” Lima pang Facebook post ang may kagayang quote card, at isa lang ang nagsabing katuwaan lang ito. Kaya lalong napaniwala ang maraming netizen na sinabi talaga ito ng DTI secretary, at hinamon siyang maghanda ng sardinas sa noche buena. Walang post tungkol sa “sardinas sa noche buena” ang official Facebook page ng DTI at ni Christina Aldeguer-Roque. Wala ring sardinas sa noche buena guide ng DTI na paulit-ulit binabanggit ng sekretarya mula nang batikusin ang sinabi niyang kasya ang 500 pesos pang-noche buena. Ilan sa mga nasa noche buena guide ang ham, fruit cocktail, all-purpose cream, nata de coco, kaong, keso de bola, cheese, mayonnaise, sandwich spread, macaroni, spaghetti at tomato sauce. Ang mga picture ng DTI secretary na pinagmumukhang inirerekomenda niyang magsardinas na lang sa noche buena ay galing sa Facebook page na Proud Bisaya Bai noong Nov. 13, dalawang linggo bago niya sinabing kasya ang 500 pesos pang-noche buena ng pamilyang may tatlong miyembro.

"House Speaker Gloria M. Arroyo at work. Screengrab from the House video. Last week, The House of Representatives adopted a Resolution that would make it extremely difficult to get a copy of the members’ Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth. House Resolution No. 2467, authored by 10 members of the House led by Speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo set requirements that makes the use of SALN as an anti-corruption almost impossible. The motive of the of the authors is obvious: they don’t want the public to know they got richer while in public office. Arroyo’s co-authors are Majority Leader Fredenil Castro; RepresentativesYedda Marie Romualdez; Raymond Democrito C. Mendoza; Delphine Gan Lee; Vicente S.F. Veloso; Cristina Roa-Puno; Joey S. Salceda; Milagros Aquino-Magsaysay; and Mohamad Khalid Q. Dimaporo. Among the objectionable provisions of HR 2467 are: -The SALN Review and Compliance Committee shall…act on all requests for copies of filed SALNs of House Members, officers and employees provided that access to copies of the SALNs of House Members by the public shall also be approved by a majority of the House in plenary session. – As part of the evaluation, the Secretariat shall also furnish the concerned House Member, officer or employee with a copy of the SALN Request Form and the concerned House Member, officer or employee may submit a comment to the Secretariat within a reasonable period. There are House 303 seats but currently, there are 291 members. Six have died, one resigned, four were appointed to executive positions and one was dropped from the roster. Under HR 2467, a journalist writing a story on the unexplained wealth of a member of the House would have to get the approval 146 of the subject’s colleagues. Also, the subject of the article will have a say whether to release his SALN or not. They might as well have passed a Resolution declaring their SALN “Secret” and banning the release to the public. There are a few members of the House who oppose HR2467. Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano said it is “nothing but a shield of protection for corrupt officials and employees in government that are trying to run away from public accountability.” HR 2467 Resolution negates the anti-corruption essence of Art. XI Sec. 17 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution . Under the section “Accountability of Public Officers, it states: “A public officer or employee shall, upon assumption of office and as often thereafter as may be required by law, submit a declaration under oath of his assets, liabilities, and net worth. “In the case of the President, the Vice-President, the Members of the Cabinet, the Congress, the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Commissions and other constitutional offices, and officers of the armed forces with general or flag rank, the declaration shall be disclosed to the public in the manner provided by law.” Republic Act No. 6713, the “Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees” states that the SALN must be filed “within thirty (30) days after assumption of office; “on or before April 30, of every year thereafter; and “within thirty (30) days after separation from the service. “ What should be declared in the SALN? RA 6713 enumerates them: Real property, its improvements, acquisition costs, assessed value and current fair market value; personal property and acquisition cost; all other assets such as investments, cash on hand or in banks, stocks, bonds, and the like; liabilities, and; all business interests and financial connections including those of their spouses and of unmarried children under eighteen (18) years of age living in their households. RA 6713 also states that in the SALN, “It shall be the duty of every public official or employee to identify and disclose, to the best of his knowledge and information, his relatives in the Government in the form, manner and frequency prescribed by the Civil Service Commission.” The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines in a statement said, “We find it ironic that a document meant to help advance transparency in government is now being subjected to so many rules and restrictions by the very people entrusted to craft the laws of the land.” NUJP protests the requirement of P300 fee for a request for a SALN of a member of the House which could total to P90,000 for all members of the House. “SALNs are public documents and should be accessible to everyone,” NUJP said. HR 2467 is another blockade to access to information. Which is not surprising because the Freedom of Information bill got nowhere in the House. Information gives substance to people participation in a democracy.Information empowers people so they can make wise decisions. HR 2467 would rather that the people are kept in the dark especially on matters about their wealth.",True,true,Previous PostPrevious post:GMA’s HR2467: making  SALN unusable as anti-corruption tool,https://verafiles.org/articles/gmas-hr2467-making-saln-unusable-anti-corruption-tool,Vera Files
"After saying that the impeachment complaint against Vice President Sara Duterte is dead, Senate Minority Leader Vicente Sotto III now admits it is “technically” still alive. Nineteen of the 24 senators voted on Aug. 7 to archive the Articles of Impeachment against Duterte pending the Supreme Court’s resolution of the appeals on its ruling that declared the case unconstitutional. Sotto is among the four senators who opposed the motion. In the Aug. 7 podcast episode of Facts First Tonight with Christian Esguerra, Sotto was asked if the impeachment case against Duterte is already dead following the Senate’s decision. He answered: “Technically hindi dahil in-archive mo lang. ‘Yun ang nilinaw ko sa kanila.” (Technically no because you only archived it. That is what I clarified with them.) Source: Christian Esguerra, Tito Sotto schools senator-lawyers in Sara Duterte impeachment debates, Aug. 7, 2025, watch 15:55 to 16:10 In explaining his vote during the Senate plenary session on Aug. 6, Sotto said: “The Supreme Court decision is now pending appeal. It is prudent to wait for the results than prematurely archiving, if not dismissing, because I know for a fact, once it is archived it is dead.“ Source: Senate of the Philippines, Senate Session No. 6 (August 6, 2025), Aug. 6, 2025, watch from 3:54:36 to 3:54:55 Sotto issued the clarification a day after the Senate vote, as some of his fellow legislators, political analysts and legal experts, including retired SC associate justice Adolfo Azcuna, challenged his earlier statement. Azcuna, one of the authors of the 1987 Constitution, told One News on TV5, “It (archiving the impeachment complaint) does not kill the articles. It’s still alive, only set aside.” On July 25, the Supreme Court declared as unconstitutional the Articles of Impeachment against the vice president. It ruled that the case is barred by the one-year rule under the Constitution, which states that “[n]o impeachment proceedings shall be initiated against the same official more than once within a period of one year.” The High Court further said that the decision is “immediately executory,” which prompted the Senate to convene and consequently vote to archive the impeachment case. The SC ruling is, however, not yet final. On Aug. 5, the House of Representatives filed a motion for reconsideration.

"In his second State of the Nation Address in 2023, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. promised: “In pooling a small fraction of the considerable but underutilized government funds, the (Maharlika) Fund shall be used to make high-impact and profitable investments, such as the Build Better More program. The gains from the Fund shall be reinvested into the country’s economic well-being.” More than a year and several delays later, the first project of the controversial Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF) is still pending. Here are three things you need to know: Since his appointment as Maharlika Investment Corporation (MIC) president and chief executive officer in November 2023, Rafael Consing Jr. has discussed putting its first investment into promising sectors. The MIC is the corporate arm of the country’s first sovereign wealth fund tasked to choose and decide on its investments “to generate optimal returns.” House Bill No. 6398, filed on Nov. 28, 2022, sought to create the MIF. The bill faced backlash from concerned groups due to the inclusion of GSIS and SSS as sources of funding. House Bill No. 6608, filed on Dec. 12, 2022, excluded both as funding sources; the bill breezed through the lower chamber which approved it on Dec. 15, 2022 Its counterpart Senate bill was passed five months later on May 31, 2023 after Marcos certified the proposed law as urgent. Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11954 or the MIF Act was signed into law on July 18, 2023 and its final implementing rules and regulations (IRR) took effect four months later. “It is a crucial undertaking. It will support our overall goal of 6.5 to 8% gross domestic product growth in the medium term. And through the fund, we will accelerate the implementation of the 194 NEDA Board-approved flagship infrastructure projects,” the president said in a speech at the signing ceremony of the MIF Act on July 18, 2023. By September that year, the Landbank of the Philippines and Development Bank of the Philippines had remitted the P75 billion seed money to the MIC as required by the law. On Nov. 24, 2023, Consing, former banker and executive director at the Office of the Presidential Adviser for Investments & Economic Affairs, took his oath as head of MIC. Marcos appointed four other directors the following month and the board held its inaugural meeting on Jan. 3, 2024, past the date the administration had originally committed to operationalize the sovereign fund. In a Bloomberg interview published on Jan. 18, 2024, Consing said the corporation planned to invest in “infrastructure and energy sector” by the first half of that year to address the country’s most pressing needs. He added, “I expect that (first investment) probably happening in the next 90 to about 120 days. In terms of the amount, well, that has to be determined by the committee just yet.” Source: Philippine Wealth Fund Plans First Investment in Three to Four Months, Jan. 18, 2024, watch from 0:51 to 1:00 A month later on the sidelines of the Philippine Economic Outlook forum, Consing said MIC was still finalizing its organizational structure and that the first investment would instead be made at the end of 2024. He echoed this timeline in August, saying: “We have about eight memorandums of agreement currently taking due diligence on two very important investments. Both in the energy sector. And intuitively, we expect perhaps that in the next 60 to 90 days, we should be able to deploy (the investments).” Source: Senate of the Philippines Youtube page, Committee on Finance (Subcommittee A) (August 27, 2024), Aug. watch from 2:02:37 to 2:03:05 As 2024 ended, Consing again pushed back the target date, saying he expected the initial project to finally happen in the first quarter of this year. In an interview with BusinessWorld last Jan. 2, Consing admitted that organizational preparations consumed the corporation’s first year, saying: “Definitely the first quarter (MIC will make its first investment). I think we had a year to set up. We had a year to basically put our governance in place. We obtained our formal approval to begin hiring last end of July.” Source: BusinessWorld, Maharlika plans its 1st investment in Q1, Jan. 7, 2025 Consing said that MIC now expects its first investment to still be in the energy sector with the healthcare industry to follow within the first half of 2025. ﻿ Marcos threw out the original IRR of the MIF law dated Aug. 22, 2023. In an Oct. 19, 2023 speech, he denied that this meant putting the MIF “on hold.” “We have found more improvements that we can make, specifically to the organizational structure of the Maharlika Fund,” the president said. “The concept [of the MIF] remains a good one and we are still committed to having it operational before the end of the year [2023].” The revised IRR was signed on Nov. 10, 2023, but Marcos replaced then finance secretary Benjamin Diokno, slowing down the structural organization of the corporation. Section 20 of the MIF Act provides that the secretary of finance automatically assumes the position of chairperson of the MIC’s board of directors. Diokno turned over his position to current Finance secretary and MIC Chairman of the Board Ralph Recto on Jan. 15, 2024. Section 30 of the revised IRR added the provision that the president can reject the advisory body’s recommendation for director positions. It also amended Section 29 of the original IRR which specified the qualifications required of MIC directors, including a master’s degree and a 10-year experience in relevant fields. These are excluded from the revised version, which also removed the itemized responsibilities of the risk management and audit committees in Sections 41 and 42, respectively, of the original IRR. Sections 39 and 40 of the revised version changed these into: “The specific functions of the Risk Management Committee shall be determined by the Board,” and “The Board shall organize an Audit Committee and prescribe its functions and membership.” RTVMalacanang YouTube page, The 2023 State of the Nation Address 07/24/2023, July 24, 2023 Supreme Court E-Library, Republic Act (R.A.)

"Two YouTube videos are claiming that the International Criminal Court has dismissed the crimes against humanity case against former president Rodrigo Duterte. This is false. The Hague-based international tribunal has yet to begin the trial of Duterte in connection with his bloody drug war. The ICC has provisionally scheduled the confirmation of charges hearing against the former chief executive on Sept. 23, when the judges will decide if there is sufficient evidence for the case to proceed to trial. One of the videos, published on Aug. 3, bore a headline that read: “Hala Konfermado na,Sawakas Digong Uuwi na,Icc Naawa,Kaufman may Problema,Supergoodnews Dds, Vpsara (Whoa, it’s confirmed. At last, Digong is coming home! ICC showed mercy, Kaufman has a problem. Super good news for DDS, VP Sara).” Both videos carried on their thumbnails the erroneous claim of the supposed dismissal of Duterte’s case at the ICC. These are merely clickbaits as the videos showed an unrelated Facebook livestream of former presidential spokesperson Harry Roque on Aug. 3 visiting Filipino seafarers at the Scheveningen port. Roque did not mention the supposed dismissal of Duterte’s charges before the ICC or anything related to the case. The former presidential spokesman, along with the Filipino seamen, only chanted, “Duterte, bring him home,” at the end of his livestream. As of Aug. 6, the latest ruling released by the ICC was dated July 23, when Pre-Trial Chamber I granted the request of Duterte’s legal team to defer the issuance of a decision on the interim release plea filed by the Defense on June 12. The spurious videos emerged four days after Nicholas Kaufman, head of Duterte’s defense team, was quoted as saying in a July 30 FB post that Duterte “has made it known that Roque should stop interfering in his case.” Roque denied interfering in Duterte’s case but admitted that he “offered an additional legal remedy, outside of the ICC, subject to the approval of the former president and his family.” Published by YouTube channels Viral Balita Philippines (created on July 30, 2022) and Viral PHNEWS (June 28, 2022), the videos with untrue claims have collectively garnered 208,211 views and 5,847 likes as of writing.",Fake,fake,"FACT CHECK: Unrelated footage used to FALSELY claim ICC dismissal of Duterte caseByVERA FILES|Aug 6, 2025|2-minute readTwo YouTube videos are claiming that the International Criminal Court has dismissed the crimes against humanity case against former president Rodrigo Duterte.

"Senator Christopher “Bong” Go is the subject of a fake quote card on ABS-CBN circulating on Twitter since May 9. The image, an altered May 4 infographic by news organization One News, alleges that Go blames the media network itself for going off the air on May 5: “Wala dapat sisihin sa pagsasara ng ABS-CBN kung hindi mismo sila. Kung hindi sana nila sinaktan ang damdamin ng Presidente eh hindi na sana hahantong pa sa ganito (No one should be blamed for the shutdown of ABS-CBN but the station itself. If they didn’t hurt the President’s feelings, it wouldn’t have reached this point).” A cursory search on Google shows no record of the former special aide to the president uttering that statement on May 4 or any other day. But Go did mention the president’s “hurt feelings” during the Feb. 24 Senate hearing on ABS-CBN’s legislative franchise: “Hindi mababaw ang rason ng pangulo sa kanyang grievances against the network. Nasaktan ang presidente, nababoy ang presidente (The president’s grievances against the network are not superficial. The president was hurt. The president was disrespected).” One News has also debunked Go’s fake quote in a May 9 tweet. The original infographic was Go’s statement on the new rate for members’ health insurance contribution to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (Philhealth), where he urged the agency to grant the needed payment extension amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Go released a statement on the May 5 Cease-and-Desist Order by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) against ABS-CBN. Referring to a bill seeking to renew the network’s franchise, the senator is “urging the House of Representatives to act on this matter with due haste.” “Upon reaching the Senate and once we have had a chance to conduct our own hearings on the matter, that is when I will decide and vote according to my conscience and the interest of the Filipino people,” he said. The fake quote card was made days after ABS-CBN was barred from operating past the expiration of its franchise on May 4. The netizen’s tweet of the fabricated quote card reached 147 retweets, 763 likes and 150 comments. (Editor’s Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.

"Social media posts bearing false information on China’s public health circulated early January, following reports there of a surge in respiratory infections caused by the virus called the human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Dr. Margaret Harris, spokesperson of the World Health Organization (WHO), clarified that HMPV is not a cause for alarm as it is expected that countries in the northern hemisphere experience a month-on-month increase in acute respiratory infections during winter. The Philippines’ Department of Health (DOH) has likewise allayed fears about the virus. “The HMPV is not a new virus. We have long been able to detect it. Its symptoms are not severe as well. Like the common cough and cold, an HMPV infection naturally subsides as long as one’s immune system is strong,” Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said in Filipino in a Jan. 8 press statement. What is HMPV and where did it come from? How does it spread? Here are two things you need to know: HMPV is a common respiratory virus that circulates in many countries from winter through spring, according to WHO. It is known to cause upper respiratory infection among adults and children below the age of five. This leads to a runny nose, coughs and sore throat. The DOH said that in rare severe cases, HMPV infection may result in bronchitis or pneumonia, especially for babies, older adults and immunocompromised people. Those with existing lung conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema are at high risk of severe outcomes. The virus was first discovered in the Netherlands in 2001 and very young children then who were infected required hospitalization and mechanical ventilation, based on a study published that same year. Serological surveys, or population-based blood tests, “showed that by the age of five years virtually all children in the Netherlands have been exposed to HMPV and that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least half a century,” according to the study. The virus spreads either through close contact with a person sick with it, sharing a closed space with them, or through contact with a contaminated surface. Some Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines, reported cases of HMPV infection in December 2024. In the Philippines, the DOH recorded 284 cases of HMPV in 2024, 10 of which were detected from Dec. 1 to Dec. 21. It ranked sixth as the cause of influenza-like illness in the country. “Sinusuri ang HMPV bilang bahagi ng panel 2 (expanded panel) para sa mga specimen na negatibo ang pagsubok sa panel 1 (para sa Influenza, SARS-CoV-2, at RSV) bilang bahagi ng ating Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) at pagsubaybay sa Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI),” the DOH said in a Jan. 8 press statement. (We test for HMPV as part of panel 2 (expanded panel) for specimen negative for panel 1 (Influenza, SARS-Cov-2 at RSV) as part of our Influenza-Like Illness and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness monitoring.)

"At 6 every morning on weekdays, George* is ready to leave his home in Taytay, Rizal. Locking the door behind him, he braces himself for the traffic he expects to encounter on the way to Manila, where he works. His daily routine is no different from that of thousands of commuters who leave their homes early to avoid the peak hour traffic. They squeeze themselves into packed buses or trains to get to their workplaces on time. Some have found a more convenient way – ride a motorcycle taxi, a mode of transport that became a popular alternative overnight because it speeds up travel time. The two-wheelers were transformed into public vehicles on main roads, ferrying passengers who want a faster way to get around the clogged streets. A 2017 study ‘Unlocking Cities’ by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) says travel around Metro Manila is 1.3 times longer during rush hours compared to travel during non-peak hours, making the metropolis second to Hanoi as the Southeast Asian country with the longest commute period during rush hour. But the operation of motorcycles as public transportation is illegal and motorcycle company Angkas was ordered by the Supreme Court in December to halt its service. The House of Representatives approved on Feb 4 a bill allowing motorcycles as public utility vehicles, but a similar measure is still pending at the Senate. Meanwhile, the technical working group (TWG) formed by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) to study how motorcycle taxis can be regulated, is reviewing whether it is within the department’s legal mandate to “issue an order to allow motorcycle taxis to operate as a legal mode of public transport even without any amended law.” Before he discovered Angkas, George rode the bus for an hour to get to work. Then he found out about the service and booked a ride.“It was more convenient because I got there earlier. Travel time was cut by half, so from one hour in a traditional jeep or bus to just 30 minutes,” he said in Pilipino. After Angkas’ operations were suspended, George went back to riding the bus to work, until he found a motorcycle-for-hire service that has been running despite the ban. George admits he still books motorcycle taxi rides to work. “I found out about it when I searched online. I just typed ‘Angkas’ and all sorts of motorcycle groups showed up. From there, I saw a lot of riders like me who book rides there,” George said, referring to a large online community of motorcycle taxi riders and drivers who book rides all over Metro Manila through Facebook. The community of over 200,000 members is a closed group, he said, where only members can join the service either as drivers or riders. Drivers post their real name and photo on their profile for them to be accepted.On the page, riders will post their pick-up and drop-off points, and fare, a process similar to that of ride-booking services Grab and Uber. Drivers comment on the post to accept a customer’s offer and riders will do likewise to indicate whose service they want to take from among the drivers who replied to the post. Illegal but still popular George knew it was illegal but faced with the prospect of sitting in traffic once more, he decided to take a motorcycle taxi again. He admitted he was anxious at first, knowing that he might get caught by law enforcers. Eventually, the fear ran past him. “I am not as anxious anymore because I’ve never experienced being stopped by traffic officers on the road because it (the service) is discreet. It’s as if you’re just with the driver. It doesn’t seem illegal.” Angkas’ motorcycle service. Photo from Angkas Facebook Page As for the fare, the group has adopted Angkas’ riding rates that start from P50, plus P10 per kilometre from the pick-up point. George shared how the rates could change depending on the traffic situation, but prices can be negotiated between the rider and the driver. Darius waits to pick up passengers This was confirmed by Darius,* a motorcycle-for-hire driver in his late 40’s, who is also part of the Facebook group. Like George, the father of three is also from Taytay. In the morning, he picks up passengers from Antipolo or Taytay and takes them to Cubao or Ortigas. Sometimes he drives up to Makati, or to as far as Bonifacio Global City. At night, he waits around Ortigas where potential customers form long lines for rides home. Usually, though, he picks up passengers who book his service through their community Facebook group. Darius claims to be part of the first batch of Angkas drivers. When the motorcycle taxi service had to suspend operations, the Facebook group was formed. Administrators of the online group are mostly Angkas employees, he said. Recruitment and training continue even though Angkas is not in operation, the motorcycle driver said, adding that he himself needs to be re-trained to be able to get a new SIM card for the app-based motorcycle taxi service. Motorcycle drivers operate on their own time, Darius explained, starting and stopping their services based on their need. In his case, he usually stops when he earns at least P1000. He admits that the current situation scares him because he could be stopped and apprehended by the police. “We’re like criminals on the road. Although I have a license, it’s not enough because motorcycle taxis are considered illegal. That is why we avoid them (police),” he explained in Pilipino. “You need to know where to pass to evade the enforcers. Don’t go through places with many checkpoints. But you’ll see on the (FB) page where there are checkpoints because someone would post that information,” Darius said. But many have been apprehended. “I know two who have been caught. This is why they announce it on the page to warn drivers.” There were no available figures of apprehensions in the past several weeks the ban has been in place, but the DOTr says 152 motorcycle riders were apprehended by the Inter- Agency Council for Traffic (I-ACT) in 2018 for various violations. Safety concerns On the issue of safety, Darius explained that motorcycle taxi services are safe and should not be banned merely on account of fears that they are unsafe. “We are experienced. We are afraid of not being safe,” he insisted.“We have great concern for our safety. I always drive safely. We have to get to our destination safely because, first of all, our lives and our motorcycles are on the line.” “My mindset as a rider is not about speed, but about safety, how one can get to one’s destination safely,” he added. The issue of safety is also being looked into by the DOTr technical working group that is studying whether to allow two-wheelers as public transport. Motorcycles are the most crash-prone among the vehicles plying the streets of Metro Manila, according to data from the Metro Manila Accident Reporting and Analysis System (MMARAS). In 2017, motorcycles figured in over 24,000 crashes that killed 247 people and injured more than 12,000. For George, the most pressing concern is the traffic. He says he doesn’t see any other solution, or expect the government to offer other alternatives to address the problem. “Last resort is to ride a motorcycle.” *not his real name This story is produced under the Bloomberg Initiative Global Road Safety Media Fellowship implemented by the World Health Organization, Department of Transportation and VERA Files.",True,true,"Next PostNext post:Beat traffic with two-wheelers, motorcycle taxi riders say",https://verafiles.org/articles/beat-traffic-two-wheelers-motorcycle-taxi-riders-say,Vera Files
"A day after a Philippine Air Force (PAF) helicopter crashed in Bohol, a Facebook (FB) user published on April 28 a false post claiming one of the victims had to wait in an ambulance until Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go arrived. Not true. The erroneous FB post featured two images which bore the caption: “PAF helicopter crash victim in Bohol had to wait for Bong Go because he told them that he would ‘assist’ the victim.” The senator did not cause any delay in transporting the crash victims, said the People’s Television Network in an FB post on April 29, based on a statement from Col. Antonio Francisco, chief of command staff of the PAF’s Air Mobility Command, who was with Go at the time. “Wala naman aniyang naantala sa operasyon (The operation, he said, was not stalled),” the state broadcaster quoted Francisco as saying. The military officer said Go was about to board his plane when he was informed that an ambulance carrying victims of the chopper crash was in the area, so he ran to see them. Go was in Lapu-Lapu City in Cebu province as a guest speaker for the 500th anniversary of the Victory of Mactan. One person died while three were hurt in the helicopter mishap in Bohol which happened during an engineering flight on the morning of April 27. The survivors were taken to Cebu and are reportedly now out of danger. The Office of Sen. Go said the senator has extended assistance to the family of the deceased pilot and to the survivors.

"Update: November 8, 2025 VERA Files Fact Check tracks false claims, flip-flops and misleading statements of public officials and figures and debunks them with factual evidence. It also debunks misinformation and disinformation spread on the internet through websites and social media. In order that the citizens can meaningfully participate in governance, which is what democracy is, they should be empowered with accurate information. Social media has democratized information distribution, which is good. However, it has also been used by malevolent elements to spread lies and falsehoods which create confusion among the citizens and undermine their ability to make informed decisions. As journalists, we at VERA Files are committed to seeking and telling the truth. Fact-checking is one of the means. We believe in accountability journalism, which is essential to a functioning democracy. Note: Public figures include former and current government officials, electoral candidates, leaders of political parties, partylists and political coalitions, journalists, experts, and key opinion leaders, including celebrities and online influencers (i.e. bloggers and vloggers). It started during the 2016 presidential elections as a class activity of VERA Files cofounder and then trustee Yvonne T. Chua at the University of the Philippines where she teaches journalism. Chua’s students fact-checked statements made by candidates for national positions, applying guidelines used by fact-checkers in other parts of the world. She and VERA Files writer Jake Soriano worked closely on the activity and posted the output in VERA Files under the “Is that so?” section. “Is that so?” became “VERA Files Fact Check” in July that year. Chua led VERA Files Fact Check until Jan. 31, 2019. We fact-check claims based on a three-point criteria. We ask ourselves the following questions: Is it a statement of fact? A fact-checkable claim is one that is categorically claimed to be a fact. VERA Files does not fact-check opinion. Is it feasible? A fact-checkable claim is one that can be disproved or given context to using readily available government records, documents, journal articles, or expert interviews, among others. Is it relevant? We fact check claims that are of public interest — anything that may affect the welfare of the general public. For online disinformation, we add another layer to our criteria: virality. We prioritize verifying content that is reaching high numbers of people or is being published by multiple accounts on social media platforms. Here’s the process: Step 1: The team monitors press conferences, speeches, events, statements, interviews etc. for statements worth fact-checking. Step 2: One team member is assigned to research and verify the “suspicious” claim or statement. He or she looks for multiple sources to do one or two of the following: (1) dispute or corroborate the claim, (2) use these for the backstory, or (3) collect as proof that there was a flip-flop. Other team members may be assigned to help in the research. Step 3: The team member writes and shares his or her findings with the entire team. Step 4: The other team members weigh in. They perform additional fact-checking and first-editing, as needed. Step 5: Infographics or videos are prepared to go with the item, as needed. Step 6: One to two senior editors finalize and sign off on the article before it is posted. VERA Files released in March 2018 an online guide: VERAfied: A DIY guide to fact checking and fighting fake news. The team holds regular meetings to brainstorm, propose stories, and challenge pitches or findings.

"Update: November 8, 2025 VERA Files Fact Check tracks false claims, flip-flops and misleading statements of public officials and figures and debunks them with factual evidence. It also debunks misinformation and disinformation spread on the internet through websites and social media. In order that the citizens can meaningfully participate in governance, which is what democracy is, they should be empowered with accurate information. Social media has democratized information distribution, which is good. However, it has also been used by malevolent elements to spread lies and falsehoods which create confusion among the citizens and undermine their ability to make informed decisions. As journalists, we at VERA Files are committed to seeking and telling the truth. Fact-checking is one of the means. We believe in accountability journalism, which is essential to a functioning democracy. Note: Public figures include former and current government officials, electoral candidates, leaders of political parties, partylists and political coalitions, journalists, experts, and key opinion leaders, including celebrities and online influencers (i.e. bloggers and vloggers). It started during the 2016 presidential elections as a class activity of VERA Files cofounder and then trustee Yvonne T. Chua at the University of the Philippines where she teaches journalism. Chua’s students fact-checked statements made by candidates for national positions, applying guidelines used by fact-checkers in other parts of the world. She and VERA Files writer Jake Soriano worked closely on the activity and posted the output in VERA Files under the “Is that so?” section. “Is that so?” became “VERA Files Fact Check” in July that year. Chua led VERA Files Fact Check until Jan. 31, 2019. We fact-check claims based on a three-point criteria. We ask ourselves the following questions: Is it a statement of fact? A fact-checkable claim is one that is categorically claimed to be a fact. VERA Files does not fact-check opinion. Is it feasible? A fact-checkable claim is one that can be disproved or given context to using readily available government records, documents, journal articles, or expert interviews, among others. Is it relevant? We fact check claims that are of public interest — anything that may affect the welfare of the general public. For online disinformation, we add another layer to our criteria: virality. We prioritize verifying content that is reaching high numbers of people or is being published by multiple accounts on social media platforms. Here’s the process: Step 1: The team monitors press conferences, speeches, events, statements, interviews etc. for statements worth fact-checking. Step 2: One team member is assigned to research and verify the “suspicious” claim or statement. He or she looks for multiple sources to do one or two of the following: (1) dispute or corroborate the claim, (2) use these for the backstory, or (3) collect as proof that there was a flip-flop. Other team members may be assigned to help in the research. Step 3: The team member writes and shares his or her findings with the entire team. Step 4: The other team members weigh in. They perform additional fact-checking and first-editing, as needed. Step 5: Infographics or videos are prepared to go with the item, as needed. Step 6: One to two senior editors finalize and sign off on the article before it is posted. VERA Files released in March 2018 an online guide: VERAfied: A DIY guide to fact checking and fighting fake news. The team holds regular meetings to brainstorm, propose stories, and challenge pitches or findings.

"Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go’s claim that the number of drug lords in the Philippines went down under the leadership of President Rodrigo Duterte has no basis. STATEMENT In a Nov. 6 statement, Go “welcomed” Vice President Leni Robredo’s decision to accept Duterte’s offer to “lead the government’s anti-illegal drug efforts.” He then said: “Ilang Presidente na ba ang dumaan? Nabawasan ba ang drug lord? Nabawasan ba ang droga? Lalong dumami. Ngayon lang po ito nabawasan nang panahon ni Pangulong Duterte (How many presidents have we had? Did the number of drug lords decrease? Did drug [use] decrease? They have further increased [in the past administrations]. It is only now during President Duterte’s term that they have gone down).” Source: Senate of the Philippines, Bong Go welcomes Robredo’s acceptance of drug czar post, Nov. 6, 2019 FACT It is not clear where Go based his claim; neither the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) nor the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) keeps an official list of “drug lords” in the country. The DDB — the country’s policy-making and strategy formulating body on drug prevention and control — in its latest survey on the nature and extent of drug use in the Philippines, released in 2016, mentioned the term “drug lord” only once: when it analyzed the efficiency of drug seizure protocols. It neither cited nor included a database of drug lords operating in the country. Such category is also “not included” in the board’s ongoing census on the “real nature and extent of the country’s illegal drug problem,” which is “expected” to be released in the “first quarter of 2020,” DDB media affairs and public relations head Ella Marie Dumaculangan said in a Nov. 12 text message to VERA Files. The DDB is mandated to “conduct a nationwide survey to determine drug abuse prevalence” in the country every three years. PDEA — the country’s lead anti-drug law enforcement agency — also does not have an official list of drug lords, the agency’s spokesperson Derrick Carreon told VERA Files in a phone interview on Nov. 12. However, he said they have “data on arrests of high-value targets and [those who] may be considered as drug lords.” According to Carreon, PDEA defines “high-value targets” as “those involved in the illegal drug activity, occupying such positions in the society that have a certain sphere of influence.” He said high-value targets include: “Drug lords,” on the other hand, are those who have a “sphere of influence over a certain locality” and have “control [over] the supply and the trade of [illegal] drugs,” Carreon said. They are automatically classified as “high-value” targets and can operate in “varying degrees” — from “local” to “transnational,” he added.

"Amid heightened activities of Mayon Volcano this early January, a video showing its 2018 eruption is being circulated online with the wrong context. On Jan. 6, a Facebook page uploaded a 10-second clip showing the volcano in Legazpi, Albay erupting and spewing a huge ash plume. The post bore the caption: “Kuhang kuha ang acutual (sic) na pag sabog ng Mayon Volcano (The actual eruption of Mayon Volcano was perfectly captured). #faith #spiritualgrowth #prayer #spirituality #responsibledrinking #god #safety #faithingod #wellness #publicserviceannouncement.” The video also bore the text: “Grabe ang actual na pag sabog [ng] Mayon Volcano (The actual eruption of Mayon Volcano was severe).” This is false. The eruption shown in the circulating video occurred in 2018. While Mayon Volcano’s unrest is currently intensifying, the clip is not an accurate depiction of its activities recorded this month. The first frame of the video matches a picture of the volcano taken on Jan. 24, 2018 by Charism Sayat, a photojournalist who contributes images to Agence France-Presse. A part of the photo’s description on the site read: “This photo taken from a drone shows a column of ash shooting up from the Mayon volcano as it continues to erupt, seen from the city of Legazpi in Albay province, south of Manila on January 24, 2018.” According to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, Mayon Volcano had six episodes of sporadic lava fountaining reaching 400 to 500 meters high that day. These lava fountains generated ash plumes as high as 3 to 5 kilometers above the crater. What took place in Mayon Volcano this Jan. 6 was an onset of uson or dome collapse pyroclastic density current, not lava fountaining. The video with the wrong context was uploaded the same day PHIVOLCS raised Mayon Volcano’s alert status from Level 2 to Level 3. This is due to the eruption of magma (or molten rock) at the top of the volcano, which increased the risk of lava flows and avalanches of superheated gas, ash and rock. Alert Level 3 remains in force as of Jan. 9 with lava dome effusion and collapse and lava flow recorded. This is not the first time that VERA Files has debunked disinformation about the volcano in Albay.

"A photo circulating on social media claims that world leaders gathered in The Hague, Netherlands to demand the release of former president Rodrigo Duterte from detention at the International Criminal Court (ICC). This is satire. The image is an edited version of a photo taken during the 2025 summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) held in the Netherlands. The NATO Summit, attended by leaders of its member states to deliberate on security and policy issues, has no connection to Duterte’s case before the ICC. On Jan. 2, a satirical Facebook page posted a series of images depicting a standee of Duterte positioned in front of a group of NATO officials. In the background, two posters bearing the slogan “Bring him home” can be seen, as well as memes of United States Vice President JD Vance. The caption of the spurious post stated: “BREAKING NEWS Jan 2, 2026. Paki share at paki like ng page natin mga ka-DDS dahil hinding hindi ito ibabalita ng mga Bayarang Media. iiyak nanaman ang mga Bangag at Delawan/Pink dahil walang nagmamahal sa kanilang idolo.

GOOD NEWS, fellow DDS. Presidents and leaders around the world have gathered to support the release of Tatay Rodrigo “Digong” Duterte and his return to Davao City. World leaders gathered in The Hague, Netherlands, to demand the immediate release of former President Rodrigo Duterte.) Edited photo A reverse image search shows that the original photo was taken at a social dinner hosted by King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima at Huis ten Bosch Palace in The Hague during the NATO Summit on June 24, 2025. It does not contain a Duterte standee, “Bring him home” posters, nor the memes of Vance. The event also made no official mention of Duterte. According to the 2025 The Hague Summit Declaration, NATO leaders focused on discussing key decisions such as boosting defense spending, strengthening deterrence and defense, and providing support for Ukraine. Satirical page The FB page that shared the post describes itself in its bio as “SATIRE PARODailY News.” A quick review of the page also confirms that it has been uploading satirical posts related to Duterte’s case at the ICC. Duterte has been in the custody of the ICC since his arrest in March 2025 for alleged crimes against humanity charges. Last Nov. 28, the ICC Appeals Chamber rejected his appeal for an interim release request. As of writing, the satirical post published by the Facebook page Duterte Supporter 3r1t4s Copium News (created Dec. 19, 2025) has so far received 1,100 reactions, 252 shares, and 249 comments.
