"After saying that the impeachment complaint against Vice President Sara Duterte is dead, Senate Minority Leader Vicente Sotto III now admits it is “technically” still alive. Nineteen of the 24 senators voted on Aug. 7 to archive the Articles of Impeachment against Duterte pending the Supreme Court’s resolution of the appeals on its ruling that declared the case unconstitutional. Sotto is among the four senators who opposed the motion. In the Aug. 7 podcast episode of Facts First Tonight with Christian Esguerra, Sotto was asked if the impeachment case against Duterte is already dead following the Senate’s decision. He answered: “Technically hindi dahil in-archive mo lang. ‘Yun ang nilinaw ko sa kanila.” (Technically no because you only archived it. That is what I clarified with them.) Source: Christian Esguerra, Tito Sotto schools senator-lawyers in Sara Duterte impeachment debates, Aug. 7, 2025, watch 15:55 to 16:10 In explaining his vote during the Senate plenary session on Aug. 6, Sotto said: “The Supreme Court decision is now pending appeal. It is prudent to wait for the results than prematurely archiving, if not dismissing, because I know for a fact, once it is archived it is dead.“ Source: Senate of the Philippines, Senate Session No. 6 (August 6, 2025), Aug. 6, 2025, watch from 3:54:36 to 3:54:55 Sotto issued the clarification a day after the Senate vote, as some of his fellow legislators, political analysts and legal experts, including retired SC associate justice Adolfo Azcuna, challenged his earlier statement. Azcuna, one of the authors of the 1987 Constitution, told One News on TV5, “It (archiving the impeachment complaint) does not kill the articles. It’s still alive, only set aside.” On July 25, the Supreme Court declared as unconstitutional the Articles of Impeachment against the vice president. It ruled that the case is barred by the one-year rule under the Constitution, which states that “[n]o impeachment proceedings shall be initiated against the same official more than once within a period of one year.” The High Court further said that the decision is “immediately executory,” which prompted the Senate to convene and consequently vote to archive the impeachment case. The SC ruling is, however, not yet final. On Aug. 5, the House of Representatives filed a motion for reconsideration. It later ordered Duterte and Davao-based lawyer Israelito Torreon, who filed a separate petition in February, to comment on the House appeal within a non-extendible period of 10 days. The High Court has yet to receive Duterte’s comment.

"Two YouTube videos are claiming that the International Criminal Court has dismissed the crimes against humanity case against former president Rodrigo Duterte. This is false. The Hague-based international tribunal has yet to begin the trial of Duterte in connection with his bloody drug war. The ICC has provisionally scheduled the confirmation of charges hearing against the former chief executive on Sept. 23, when the judges will decide if there is sufficient evidence for the case to proceed to trial. One of the videos, published on Aug. 3, bore a headline that read: “Hala Konfermado na,Sawakas Digong Uuwi na,Icc Naawa,Kaufman may Problema,Supergoodnews Dds, Vpsara (Whoa, it’s confirmed. At last, Digong is coming home! ICC showed mercy, Kaufman has a problem. Super good news for DDS, VP Sara).” Both videos carried on their thumbnails the erroneous claim of the supposed dismissal of Duterte’s case at the ICC. These are merely clickbaits as the videos showed an unrelated Facebook livestream of former presidential spokesperson Harry Roque on Aug. 3 visiting Filipino seafarers at the Scheveningen port. Roque did not mention the supposed dismissal of Duterte’s charges before the ICC or anything related to the case. The former presidential spokesman, along with the Filipino seamen, only chanted, “Duterte, bring him home,” at the end of his livestream. As of Aug. 6, the latest ruling released by the ICC was dated July 23, when Pre-Trial Chamber I granted the request of Duterte’s legal team to defer the issuance of a decision on the interim release plea filed by the Defense on June 12. The spurious videos emerged four days after Nicholas Kaufman, head of Duterte’s defense team, was quoted as saying in a July 30 FB post that Duterte “has made it known that Roque should stop interfering in his case.” Roque denied interfering in Duterte’s case but admitted that he “offered an additional legal remedy, outside of the ICC, subject to the approval of the former president and his family.” Published by YouTube channels Viral Balita Philippines (created on July 30, 2022) and Viral PHNEWS (June 28, 2022), the videos with untrue claims have collectively garnered 208,211 views and 5,847 likes as of writing.",Fake,fake,"FACT CHECK: Unrelated footage used to FALSELY claim ICC dismissal of Duterte caseByVERA FILES|Aug 6, 2025|2-minute readTwo YouTube videos are claiming that the International Criminal Court has dismissed the crimes against humanity case against former president Rodrigo Duterte.

"Social media posts bearing false information on China’s public health circulated early January, following reports there of a surge in respiratory infections caused by the virus called the human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Dr. Margaret Harris, spokesperson of the World Health Organization (WHO), clarified that HMPV is not a cause for alarm as it is expected that countries in the northern hemisphere experience a month-on-month increase in acute respiratory infections during winter. The Philippines’ Department of Health (DOH) has likewise allayed fears about the virus. “The HMPV is not a new virus. We have long been able to detect it. Its symptoms are not severe as well. Like the common cough and cold, an HMPV infection naturally subsides as long as one’s immune system is strong,” Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said in Filipino in a Jan. 8 press statement. What is HMPV and where did it come from? How does it spread? Here are two things you need to know: HMPV is a common respiratory virus that circulates in many countries from winter through spring, according to WHO. It is known to cause upper respiratory infection among adults and children below the age of five. This leads to a runny nose, coughs and sore throat. The DOH said that in rare severe cases, HMPV infection may result in bronchitis or pneumonia, especially for babies, older adults and immunocompromised people. Those with existing lung conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema are at high risk of severe outcomes. The virus was first discovered in the Netherlands in 2001 and very young children then who were infected required hospitalization and mechanical ventilation, based on a study published that same year. Serological surveys, or population-based blood tests, “showed that by the age of five years virtually all children in the Netherlands have been exposed to HMPV and that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least half a century,” according to the study. The virus spreads either through close contact with a person sick with it, sharing a closed space with them, or through contact with a contaminated surface. Some Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines, reported cases of HMPV infection in December 2024. In the Philippines, the DOH recorded 284 cases of HMPV in 2024, 10 of which were detected from Dec. 1 to Dec. 21. It ranked sixth as the cause of influenza-like illness in the country. “Sinusuri ang HMPV bilang bahagi ng panel 2 (expanded panel) para sa mga specimen na negatibo ang pagsubok sa panel 1 (para sa Influenza, SARS-CoV-2, at RSV) bilang bahagi ng ating Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) at pagsubaybay sa Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI),” the DOH said in a Jan. 8 press statement. (We test for HMPV as part of panel 2 (expanded panel) for specimen negative for panel 1 (Influenza, SARS-Cov-2 at RSV) as part of our Influenza-Like Illness and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness monitoring.)

"In his second State of the Nation Address in 2023, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. promised: “In pooling a small fraction of the considerable but underutilized government funds, the (Maharlika) Fund shall be used to make high-impact and profitable investments, such as the Build Better More program. The gains from the Fund shall be reinvested into the country’s economic well-being.” More than a year and several delays later, the first project of the controversial Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF) is still pending. Here are three things you need to know: Since his appointment as Maharlika Investment Corporation (MIC) president and chief executive officer in November 2023, Rafael Consing Jr. has discussed putting its first investment into promising sectors. The MIC is the corporate arm of the country’s first sovereign wealth fund tasked to choose and decide on its investments “to generate optimal returns.” House Bill No. 6398, filed on Nov. 28, 2022, sought to create the MIF. The bill faced backlash from concerned groups due to the inclusion of GSIS and SSS as sources of funding. House Bill No. 6608, filed on Dec. 12, 2022, excluded both as funding sources; the bill breezed through the lower chamber which approved it on Dec. 15, 2022 Its counterpart Senate bill was passed five months later on May 31, 2023 after Marcos certified the proposed law as urgent. Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11954 or the MIF Act was signed into law on July 18, 2023 and its final implementing rules and regulations (IRR) took effect four months later. “It is a crucial undertaking. It will support our overall goal of 6.5 to 8% gross domestic product growth in the medium term. And through the fund, we will accelerate the implementation of the 194 NEDA Board-approved flagship infrastructure projects,” the president said in a speech at the signing ceremony of the MIF Act on July 18, 2023. By September that year, the Landbank of the Philippines and Development Bank of the Philippines had remitted the P75 billion seed money to the MIC as required by the law. On Nov. 24, 2023, Consing, former banker and executive director at the Office of the Presidential Adviser for Investments & Economic Affairs, took his oath as head of MIC. Marcos appointed four other directors the following month and the board held its inaugural meeting on Jan. 3, 2024, past the date the administration had originally committed to operationalize the sovereign fund. In a Bloomberg interview published on Jan. 18, 2024, Consing said the corporation planned to invest in “infrastructure and energy sector” by the first half of that year to address the country’s most pressing needs. He added, “I expect that (first investment) probably happening in the next 90 to about 120 days. In terms of the amount, well, that has to be determined by the committee just yet.” Source: Philippine Wealth Fund Plans First Investment in Three to Four Months, Jan. 18, 2024, watch from 0:51 to 1:00 A month later on the sidelines of the Philippine Economic Outlook forum, Consing said MIC was still finalizing its organizational structure and that the first investment would instead be made at the end of 2024. He echoed this timeline in August, saying: “We have about eight memorandums of agreement currently taking due diligence on two very important investments. Both in the energy sector. And intuitively, we expect perhaps that in the next 60 to 90 days, we should be able to deploy (the investments).” Source: Senate of the Philippines Youtube page, Committee on Finance (Subcommittee A) (August 27, 2024), Aug. watch from 2:02:37 to 2:03:05 As 2024 ended, Consing again pushed back the target date, saying he expected the initial project to finally happen in the first quarter of this year. In an interview with BusinessWorld last Jan. 2, Consing admitted that organizational preparations consumed the corporation’s first year, saying: “Definitely the first quarter (MIC will make its first investment). I think we had a year to set up. We had a year to basically put our governance in place. We obtained our formal approval to begin hiring last end of July.” Source: BusinessWorld, Maharlika plans its 1st investment in Q1, Jan. 7, 2025 Consing said that MIC now expects its first investment to still be in the energy sector with the healthcare industry to follow within the first half of 2025. Marcos threw out the original IRR of the MIF law dated Aug. 22, 2023. In an Oct. 19, 2023 speech, he denied that this meant putting the MIF “on hold.” “We have found more improvements that we can make, specifically to the organizational structure of the Maharlika Fund,” the president said. “The concept [of the MIF] remains a good one and we are still committed to having it operational before the end of the year [2023].” The revised IRR was signed on Nov. 10, 2023, but Marcos replaced then finance secretary Benjamin Diokno, slowing down the structural organization of the corporation. Section 20 of the MIF Act provides that the secretary of finance automatically assumes the position of chairperson of the MIC’s board of directors. Diokno turned over his position to current Finance secretary and MIC Chairman of the Board Ralph Recto on Jan. 15, 2024. Section 30 of the revised IRR added the provision that the president can reject the advisory body’s recommendation for director positions. It also amended Section 29 of the original IRR which specified the qualifications required of MIC directors, including a master’s degree and a 10-year experience in relevant fields. These are excluded from the revised version, which also removed the itemized responsibilities of the risk management and audit committees in Sections 41 and 42, respectively, of the original IRR. Sections 39 and 40 of the revised version changed these into: “The specific functions of the Risk Management Committee shall be determined by the Board,” and “The Board shall organize an Audit Committee and prescribe its functions and membership.” RTVMalacanang YouTube page, The 2023 State of the Nation Address 07/24/2023, July 24, 2023 Supreme Court E-Library, Republic Act (R.A.)

"A video announcement circulating on Facebook claims that all Filipinos aged 15 years old and above must undergo house-to-house drug testing. This is fake and the clip was likely generated using artificial intelligence. A review of the official website and FB page of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency shows no recent announcement or memorandum circular mandating such a drug testing approach. A quick keyword search on Google also yielded no credible news reports on this. The earliest copy of the bogus video that VERA Files has tracked down was published on Jan. 8. The clip shows two women alleging: “Paalala! Lahat ng Filipino ay required na magpa-drug test mula 15 years old pataas at house-to-house ang gagawing drug test para walang makakatakas. Tingnan niyo sa post namin ang mga lugar na uunahing i-drug test. Huwag ipagwalang-bahala. Sa post na ito, i-share para marami ang ma-alerto.” (Reminder! All Filipinos aged 15 years old and above are required to undergo a drug test, which will be conducted house-to-house so no one can escape. Check our post for the areas that will be prioritized for drug testing. Do not ignore this. Share this post to alert more people.) Article III, Section 36 of Republic Act. No. 9165, or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, only provides that drug tests should be done by “any government forensic laboratories or by any of the drug testing laboratories accredited and monitored by the [Department of Health] to safeguard the quality of test results.” There is no provision in the law about mandatory door-to-door drug testing, contrary to what some FB pages are spreading online. RA 9165 also specifies those who should be subjected to drug tests. These include applicants for drivers’ and firearms licenses; high school and college students; officers and employees of public and private offices; members of the police, military and other law enforcement agencies; those charged with crimes whose penalties are more than six years; and all candidates for public office, whether appointed or elected. AI detection tool Hive Moderation flagged the video as 99.9% likely to be AI-generated. One red flag in the clip was the mispronunciation of the Filipino word “makakatakas” by one of the women announcers. The watermark of Google’s AI video tool, Veo, appears on the lower right corner of the clip but was posted by the FB pages without a disclaimer or label indicating it was AI-made. Instead, the captions only contained two links that were supposed to lead netizens to the notice and list of areas where the drug testing would be conducted. The bogus links are bait to bring people to several product pages on two online shopping sites. CHR: House-to-house drug testing unlawful In 2017, VERA Files reported house-to-house drug testing being done by the police in Payatas, Quezon City, using “do-it-yourself drug testing kits.” The Commission on Human Rights said that such practice “runs contrary” to RA 9165, noting that “from a human rights perspective, there is a violation of the presumption of innocence.” Published by FB pages Nagkakaisang Pilipino TV Newsline (created on Nov. 25, 2025), Edukasyon Newsline Updates (Sept. 12, 2025), and Malasakit News: Balitang Sapat, Serbisyong Totoo (Jan. 8, 2026), the five posts carrying the AI-generated video advisory have collectively amassed 633,400 views, 9,026 reactions, 1,088 comments and 6,068 shares as of writing.",Fake,fake,"FACT CHECK: NO mandatory house-to-house drug testing for FilipinosA video announcement on Facebook is claiming that all Filipino citizens aged 15 years old and above are required to undergo house-to-house drug testing.

The former justice secretary said he had asked the National Bureau of Investigation to look into the spread of what he called an “orchestrated campaign” which has “reached the limit of cyberlibel.” The ombudsman’s younger brother, Interior and Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla, also debunked the claims.

"A photo circulating on social media claims that world leaders gathered in The Hague, Netherlands to demand the release of former president Rodrigo Duterte from detention at the International Criminal Court (ICC). This is satire. The image is an edited version of a photo taken during the 2025 summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) held in the Netherlands. The NATO Summit, attended by leaders of its member states to deliberate on security and policy issues, has no connection to Duterte’s case before the ICC. On Jan. 2, a satirical Facebook page posted a series of images depicting a standee of Duterte positioned in front of a group of NATO officials. In the background, two posters bearing the slogan “Bring him home” can be seen, as well as memes of United States Vice President JD Vance. The caption of the spurious post stated: “BREAKING NEWS Jan 2, 2026.

A reverse image search shows that the original photo was taken at a social dinner hosted by King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima at Huis ten Bosch Palace in The Hague during the NATO Summit on June 24, 2025. It does not contain a Duterte standee, “Bring him home” posters, nor the memes of Vance. The event also made no official mention of Duterte. According to the 2025 The Hague Summit Declaration, NATO leaders focused on discussing key decisions such as boosting defense spending, strengthening deterrence and defense, and providing support for Ukraine.

"Kumakalat ang mga pekeng quotes ni US President Donald Trump na susunduin si dating pangulong Rodrigo Duterte sa International Criminal Court sa Netherlands matapos dakpin ng US ang pangulo ng bansang Venezuela. Simula January 5 ay may Facebook pages at users na nagbabahagi nitong dalawang quote card na may picture ni Trump at sagisag ng United States President: “Like what I did to Venezuelan President Maduro, I will do to Former President Rodrigo Duterte. My troops are ready to pick him up from the ICC Detention Center. I stand with my friend from the Philippines, he did nothing wrong. I’ll have to rescue him whatever it takes. ICC is unfair and unjust, I’ll missile Duterte out. I’ll bring him home!” (Ang ginawa ko sa pangulo ng Venezuela ay gagawin ko rin kay dating pangulong Rodrigo Duterte. Susunduin siya sa ICC ng mga sundalo ko. Pinapanigan ko ang kaibigan kong si Duterte mula sa Pilipinas na walang ginawang masama. Ililigtas ko siya anumang mangyari. Hindi patas at hindi makatarungan ang ICC. Pauuwiin ko si Duterte!) “If there’s one thing I believe, it’s standing by allies. President Duterte led his country his way, and I respect that. I will use every diplomatic channel available to help ensure that FPRRD is treated fairly and to push for his release from the ICC. Strong leaders deserve strong support.” (Naniniwala ako sa pagtulong sa mga kakampi. Nirerespeto kong may sariling paraan si Duterte sa pamumuno. Gagawin ko ang lahat ng puwedeng pakikipag-usap para siguruhing tinatrato nang tama si Duterte, at isusulong ko ang paglaya niya sa ICC. Kailangan ng malalakas na lider ng malakas na suporta.) Peke ang dalawang quotes na ito. Walang sinabi si Trump tungkol sa pagkakadetena ni Duterte sa Netherlands at mga kaso niya sa ICC. May ibang isyu ang US laban sa ICC, gaya ng pagkompronta ng US sa ilang ICC judges. Pero wala itong kinalaman sa pagkakadetena ni Duterte sa ICC. Wala ring post tungkol sa pekeng quotes ang mga social media account ni Trump o mga official channel ng White House at US Embassy sa Pilipinas. Ang mga pekeng quotes ay pinakalat dalawang araw matapos dakpin ng US at dalhin sa New York ang pangulo ng Venezuela para harapin ang maraming kaso ng terorismo, korapsyon at ilegal na droga. Dalawang araw din pagtapos dakpin ang pangulo ng Venezuela, nag-post ng open letter ang dating anti-corruption commissioner ni Duterte na si Greco Belgica, na nakikiusap kay Trump na tulungang mapauwi si Duterte.

"May ipinakakalat na Facebook video na ipinagmumukhang sinalubong ng overseas Filipino workers ang paglaya raw ni dating pangulong Rodrigo Duterte sa International Criminal Court. Hindi ito totoo. Ang video ay kinuhanan noong pro-Duterte prayer rally sa Italy noong March 16, limang araw pagtapos arestuhin si Duterte sa Manila papuntang Netherlands, kung saan nananatili siyang nakadetena pagtapos tanggihan ng ICC noong Nov. 28 na palayain siya pansamantala. Ini-upload noong Dec. 10 ang video na may nakasulat na: “Magagalit na naman ang mga loyalist ngayon.” At may reaction ng lalaking nagsasabing: “Good news, mga kababayan!

"May pinakakalat na quote card na sinabi raw ng DTI secretary Cristina Roque na puwede namang magsardinas kaysa mag-ham sa noche buena. Peke ito. Walang patunay ang mga nag-post ng quote card. Hindi ito sinabi ng sekretarya o ng kahit sino sa Department of Trade and Industry. Hindi rin ito ibinalita ng kahit anong mapagkakatiwalaang media. Ini-upload noong Dec. 8 ang picture ng DTI secretary na may hawak na de-latang sardinas at may nakasulat na: “KUNG PWEDE NAMAN KAYO MAG SARDINAS SA NOCHE BUENA BAKIT PA KAYO MAG HA-HAM? KALABISAN NA YUN! – DTI SEC CRISTINA ROQUE” Lima pang Facebook post ang may kagayang quote card, at isa lang ang nagsabing katuwaan lang ito. Kaya lalong napaniwala ang maraming netizen na sinabi talaga ito ng DTI secretary, at hinamon siyang maghanda ng sardinas sa noche buena. Walang post tungkol sa “sardinas sa noche buena” ang official Facebook page ng DTI at ni Christina Aldeguer-Roque. Wala ring sardinas sa noche buena guide ng DTI na paulit-ulit binabanggit ng sekretarya mula nang batikusin ang sinabi niyang kasya ang 500 pesos pang-noche buena. Ilan sa mga nasa noche buena guide ang ham, fruit cocktail, all-purpose cream, nata de coco, kaong, keso de bola, cheese, mayonnaise, sandwich spread, macaroni, spaghetti at tomato sauce. Ang mga picture ng DTI secretary na pinagmumukhang inirerekomenda niyang magsardinas na lang sa noche buena ay galing sa Facebook page na Proud Bisaya Bai noong Nov. 13, dalawang linggo bago niya sinabing kasya ang 500 pesos pang-noche buena ng pamilyang may tatlong miyembro. Sa mga picture ay ipinakikita ang DTI secretary na sinisiguro ang tamang pagpepresyo ng isang supermarket sa Cebu City noong Nov. 13, pagtapos ipagbawal sa buong Pilipinas ang pagtaas ng presyo ng mahahalagang produkto sa loob ng dalawang buwan dahil sa sunod-sunod na mga kalamidad sa Visayas noong November.

"May Facebook page na nagsasabing lalaya na raw sa pagkakadetena sa International Criminal Court si dating pangulong Rodrigo Duterte dahil sa resulta ng medical exam na ginawa ng “ICC chief medical officer”. Peke ito. Noong Dec. 6 ay kinumpirma ng abogado ni Duterte na si Nicholas Kaufman na “the defense has been provided with the reports of the court-appointed panel of experts (binigyan sila ng medical results galing sa mga ekspertong pinili ng ICC).” Pero inilinaw niyang “confidential” o hindi isinasapubliko ang medical result. Ang pekeng quote card ay ini-upload noong Dec. 3, dalawang araw bago ang deadline ng ICC para makompleto ang mga ekspertong titingin sa kondisyon ni Duterte. Ayon sa quote card, sinabi raw ni “ICC chief medical officer Dr. Steven Wolfe” na: “After examining former President Rodrigo Duterte, I confirm that he is experiencing advanced symptoms of Ligma Degenerative Syndrome (LDS), a condition causing cardiovascular instability, limited mobility, and rapid stress-related deterioration. Given his age and the progression of LDS, continued ICC detention poses serious medical risks and will likely worsen his condition. He requires a stable, familiar environment that cannot be provided within the facility. For humanitarian and medical reasons, I strongly recommend his immediate release. It would be in his best interest to spend Christmas in Davao with his family, where emotional support and reduced stress can help stabilize his health.” (Sa check-up ko kay pangulong Duterte, nakumpirmang nakararanas siya ng malalang sintomas ng LDS o sakit na nagdudulot ng komplikasyon sa puso, mahirap na paggalaw at mabilisang paghina dahil sa pagod. Dahil sa katandaan ni Duterte at paglala ng LDS, nanganganib siya kung patuloy siyang nakadetena sa ICC. Kailangan niya ng pamilyar na lugar na hindi nabibigay ng ICC. Para sa makatao at pangkalusugang dahilan, mariin kong inirerekomenda ang agaran niyang paglaya. Ikabubuti ng kalusugan niya kung magpa-Pasko siya sa Davao, kasama ang pamilya niyang susuportahan siya.) Hanggang nitong Dec. 8 ay hindi isinasapubliko ng ICC ang medical result ni Duterte. Binuo ng ICC ang grupo ng iba’t ibang eksperto sa pag-iisip para tingnan ang kakayanan ni Duterte na harapin ang korte. Natapos ang pagbuo ng grupo noong Nov. 14, pagtapos palitan ang dalawang eksperto. Mga palatandaang peke ang quote card: Ang quote card ay ini-upload limang araw pagtapos hindi payagan ng ICC ang pakiusap na pansamantalang makalaya si Duterte. Ang quote card ay ini-upload ng FB page na Duterte Supporter Daily News (ginawa noong March 24, 2025) at may lagpas 27,000 reactions, 12,000 shares at 4,300 comments.

"Habitually every now and then, they re-appear in the national discourse as complainants in cases they maliciously conjure up against the Duterte opposition. Let us review their records because very soon they will reprise those roles again. Jacinto “Jing” Paras and Michael “Mike” Defensor will be the signatories to the impeachment complaint that will be filed against Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the House. The drama has already been choreographed. The endorsers will be representatives Kiko Barzaga of Cavite and Richelle Singson Michael of the Ako Ilocano Ako party list. Notice the Singson involvement as key: Richelle is the daughter of the 83-year old Chavit. There are two other Singsons in the House: Ilocos Sur 1st district’s Ronald Singson (Chavit’s son) and the 2nd district’s Kristine Singson Meehan, daughter of Candon City mayor Eric Singson, Chavit’s cousin. With all his sour grapes, Chavit will make full use of his machinery that journalism professor Danilo Arao calls as the super-obese political dynasty of the Philippines. Chavit’s hand behind the complaint will probably be a factor that will spell its doom. He had just called for people power against Marcos Jr. and was rebuffed – the proper word is ignored – by the Filipino public. That is worse than being booed. But it is the presence of Paras and Defensor that makes this complaint farcical. Farce has always been their cottage industry. Paras was once Negros Oriental representative, and played a succession of roles for Rodrigo Duterte (USec of Labor and Employment, Presidential Adviser for Political Affairs, among others). But his greatest role for Duterte was to file numerous complaints against government officials perceived as “destabilizing” the Duterte administration. With Malacañang, he filed a complaint against Overall Deputy Ombudsman Melchor Arthur Carandang for what they alleged as unlawful disclosure of Duterte’s bank transactions that amounted to billions. Paras also tagged Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales as the mastermind behind maneuvers against president Duterte. Asked how he knew about it, Paras said: “Because I am intelligent.” Let’s look at that claim of intelligence. In November 2017, Paras and his gang of attack dogs (Manuelito Luna, Glenn Chong, Nasser Marohomsalic) filed a case of inciting to sedition and rebellion against then senator Antonio Trillanes. Paras et al said Trillanes “encouraged the military to kill the president.” The case never prospered. But it was truly proven that Paras was a tool of Duterte in repressing political opposition. In September 2017, there was a senate hearing on the police murder of Kian de los Santos. Justice secretary Vitaliano Aguirre was being grilled. An anonymous source took a photo of Aguirre and inadvertently captured the short messages on Aguirre’s phone. Aguirre was in a message conversation with a “Cong Jing.” Cong Jing: Naturu-an na ni Hontiveros ang testigo (Hontiveros has coached the witness). Aguirre: Yon nga sinasabi ko dito. Kaya nga expedite natin cases nyo against her (That’s what I’m saying here. That’s why we must expedite your cases against her). Both Aguirre and Paras were caught in flagrante delicto – the cases they filed against the Duterte opposition were all dictated by Rodrigo Duterte. Aguirre would later file a case of wiretapping against Sen. Risa Hontiveros – for getting caught with his and Paras’s sinister agenda against Hontiveros. Mike Defensor is of a similar mold, perhaps even worse than Paras. He was Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s secretary of Environment and Natural Resources (2004-2006). From a government regulator of mining, he became a corporate operator of mining interests after he left office. He became CEO of Pax Libera Mining, chair of NiHAO Mineral Resources Inc., chair of Geograce Resources Philippines. Those pose conflicts of interests for communities affected by mining. In 2005, he reinstated the Mineral Production Sharing Agreement of the Mindoro Nickel Project of Intex Resources that had been previously canceled by then DENR secretary Heherson Alvarez in July 2001 following public rage by local governments affected and by civil society. The impression being: what does Defensor transact behind our backs? What do we call operators like Paras and Defensor whose actions are done at the expense of ethics? Readers you supply the word. That will be the greatest infirmity of their impeachment complaint, more than having no Mary Grace Piattos as evidence. The views in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of VERA Files.",Fake,fake,"No need to guess the BBM impeachment complainantsChavit's hand behind the complaint will probably be a factor that will spell its doom.

"Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go’s claim that the number of drug lords in the Philippines went down under the leadership of President Rodrigo Duterte has no basis. In a Nov. 6 statement, Go “welcomed” Vice President Leni Robredo’s decision to accept Duterte’s offer to “lead the government’s anti-illegal drug efforts.” “Ilang Presidente na ba ang dumaan? Nabawasan ba ang drug lord? Nabawasan ba ang droga? Lalong dumami. Ngayon lang po ito nabawasan nang panahon ni Pangulong Duterte (How many presidents have we had? Did the number of drug lords decrease? Did drug [use] decrease? They have further increased [in the past administrations]. It is only now during President Duterte’s term that they have gone down).” Source: Senate of the Philippines, Bong Go welcomes Robredo’s acceptance of drug czar post, Nov. 6, 2019 It is not clear where Go based his claim; neither the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) nor the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) keeps an official list of “drug lords” in the country. The DDB — the country’s policy-making and strategy formulating body on drug prevention and control — in its latest survey on the nature and extent of drug use in the Philippines, released in 2016, mentioned the term “drug lord” only once: when it analyzed the efficiency of drug seizure protocols. It neither cited nor included a database of drug lords operating in the country. Such category is also “not included” in the board’s ongoing census on the “real nature and extent of the country’s illegal drug problem,” which is “expected” to be released in the “first quarter of 2020,” DDB media affairs and public relations head Ella Marie Dumaculangan said in a Nov. 12 text message to VERA Files. The DDB is mandated to “conduct a nationwide survey to determine drug abuse prevalence” in the country every three years. PDEA — the country’s lead anti-drug law enforcement agency — also does not have an official list of drug lords, the agency’s spokesperson Derrick Carreon told VERA Files in a phone interview on Nov. 12. However, he said they have “data on arrests of high-value targets and [those who] may be considered as drug lords.” According to Carreon, PDEA defines “high-value targets” as “those involved in the illegal drug activity, occupying such positions in the society that have a certain sphere of influence.” He said high-value targets include: “Drug lords,” on the other hand, are those who have a “sphere of influence over a certain locality” and have “control [over] the supply and the trade of [illegal] drugs,” Carreon said. They are automatically classified as “high-value” targets and can operate in “varying degrees” — from “local” to “transnational,” he added.

"There’s no let-up in the avalanche of fake, false, and misleading posts in social media rivalling in viciousness to the mysterious COVID-19. Since Solicitor General Jose Calida filed the quo warranto petition against ABS-CBN February 10, the DDS trolls intensified and became more active during the Senate hearing on the leading broadcast media’s franchise which is set to expire May 4. One of the posts that was shared over 6,600 times and could have reached more than 3.3 million social media users was a false quote card attributed to ABS-CBN president and chief executive officer Carlo Katigbak, who testified during the Senate hearing. A fact check by VERA Files showed that “FB page Noel Landero Sarifa, named after its owner who describes himself as a ‘Dutertard’ or supporter of President Rodrigo Duterte in his About page, posted on Feb. 25 an image of Katigbak juxtaposed with text that read: “‘Netflix and YouTube are foreign owned. Why are they being allowed in the Philippines?’ – Carlo Katigbak ABS-CBN CEO.” The post claims the statement — enclosed in quotation marks — was made directly by the television network executive. False. Katigbak did not make the statement being attributed to him. When many netizens called him out for his false post, Sarifa merely said, “the quote was a meme base (sic) on my (his) understanding.” Top sharers of the post were to “Jail Noynoy Aquino” and public FB group President Rody Duterte Facebook Arm. Read VERA Files’ Fact check on this post here: It looks like the pro-Duterte groups do not have the monopoly ofonline disinformation. VERA Files fact checked a quote card attributed to Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go saying “‘Eh ‘di bigyan natin ng Civil Service Eligibility ang mga (Then let us give Civil Service Eligibility to) Chinese workers to replace those whining government employees. I will propose that to the President.’” The quote card, which was beside the senator’s photo used in his column in the broadsheet The Daily Tribune, carried the attribution: “Bong Go, Senator of the Republic of the PHILIPPINES speaking on behalf of Chinese nationals.” VERA Files’s search yielded no such quote from the senator, who is known as the person closest to President Duterte. The fake quote card on Go made the rounds three days after his statement was published on the Senate website. News about BI employees grabbed the headlines after the agency, during a Feb. 17 Senate hearing on online gaming operations, was accused of corruption by systematically allowing easy entry of Chinese nationals into the country in exchange for money. The bribery is now known as the pastillas scheme, describing the way money is wrapped in paper like milk candy. FB page Confeermed’s fabricated quote card already got almost 5,600 FB interactions, and could have reached around 755,000 netizens. The page, plus public FB groups SEN TRILLANES POWER and VP Leni Robredo Angel Warriors International are the post’s top traffic generators. Check out VERA Files ‘ fact check here.

"Senator Christopher “Bong” Go is the subject of a fake quote card on ABS-CBN circulating on Twitter since May 9. The image, an altered May 4 infographic by news organization One News, alleges that Go blames the media network itself for going off the air on May 5: “Wala dapat sisihin sa pagsasara ng ABS-CBN kung hindi mismo sila. Kung hindi sana nila sinaktan ang damdamin ng Presidente eh hindi na sana hahantong pa sa ganito (No one should be blamed for the shutdown of ABS-CBN but the station itself. If they didn’t hurt the President’s feelings, it wouldn’t have reached this point).” A cursory search on Google shows no record of the former special aide to the president uttering that statement on May 4 or any other day. But Go did mention the president’s “hurt feelings” during the Feb. 24 Senate hearing on ABS-CBN’s legislative franchise: “Hindi mababaw ang rason ng pangulo sa kanyang grievances against the network. Nasaktan ang presidente, nababoy ang presidente (The president’s grievances against the network are not superficial. The president was hurt. The president was disrespected).” One News has also debunked Go’s fake quote in a May 9 tweet. The original infographic was Go’s statement on the new rate for members’ health insurance contribution to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (Philhealth), where he urged the agency to grant the needed payment extension amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Go released a statement on the May 5 Cease-and-Desist Order by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) against ABS-CBN. Referring to a bill seeking to renew the network’s franchise, the senator is “urging the House of Representatives to act on this matter with due haste.” “Upon reaching the Senate and once we have had a chance to conduct our own hearings on the matter, that is when I will decide and vote according to my conscience and the interest of the Filipino people,” he said. The fake quote card was made days after ABS-CBN was barred from operating past the expiration of its franchise on May 4. The netizen’s tweet of the fabricated quote card reached 147 retweets, 763 likes and 150 comments. (Editor’s Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.

The erroneous FB post featured two images which bore the caption: “PAF helicopter crash victim in Bohol had to wait for Bong Go because he told them that he would ‘assist’ the victim.” The senator did not cause any delay in transporting the crash victims, said the People’s Television Network in an FB post on April 29, based on a statement from Col. Antonio Francisco, chief of command staff of the PAF’s Air Mobility Command, who was with Go at the time. “Wala naman aniyang naantala sa operasyon (The operation, he said, was not stalled),” the state broadcaster quoted Francisco as saying. The military officer said Go was about to board his plane when he was informed that an ambulance carrying victims of the chopper crash was in the area, so he ran to see them. Go was in Lapu-Lapu City in Cebu province as a guest speaker for the 500th anniversary of the Victory of Mactan. One person died while three were hurt in the helicopter mishap in Bohol which happened during an engineering flight on the morning of April 27. The survivors were taken to Cebu and are reportedly now out of danger. The Office of Sen. Go said the senator has extended assistance to the family of the deceased pilot and to the survivors. Another FB page, R E S I B O, also posted a screenshot of the same false post. Collectively, the two posts obtained over 3,000 shares, 3,700 reactions and 420 comments.
