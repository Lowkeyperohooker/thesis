"Tax evasion is often treated as a technical infraction — a matter of forms, loopholes, and compliance. It is not. Tax evasion is corruption. It is the deliberate theft of public resources meant to build classrooms, strengthen hospitals, finance climate resilience, and uplift communities. It enables illicit wealth, distorts public policy, and erodes trust in institutions. And it is time the world finally treated it as such. Globally, tax evasion drains an estimated US$483 billion every year, according to the Tax Justice Network. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that developing countries lose up to 6% of GDP annually, far exceeding many nations’ combined budgets for health and education. Where corruption generates illicit income, tax evasion hides it. The two crimes reinforce each other — one produces the stolen money; the other conceals it. This is why the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) must update its framework. And this is why the Philippines must lead the call. Conservative studies by the Department of Finance and the IMF estimate that the Philippines loses P700 billion to P1.3 trillion every year to tax evasion — funds that could build thousands of classrooms, upgrade hospitals, and support superior and long-term programs for transport, flood-control, and climate adaptation. Every peso stolen through corruption becomes a peso concealed through tax evasion. The public loses twice — first from the theft, then from the cover-up. 1. Launch a nationwide risk-based investigation of politically exposed persons The Department of Finance and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) must urgently conduct a nationwide, intelligence-driven investigation covering elected officials, their families, campaign donors, contractors, and individuals implicated in flood-control, pandemic procurement, and other major controversies. Mandated lifestyle checks, Statement of Assets Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) reviews, and cross-matching with property, vehicle, and offshore records must form part of an integrated anti-corruption strategy. This is not political persecution. It is good governance — long delayed and desperately needed. 2. Lift bank secrecy for tax purposes The Philippines remains one of only three countries — along with Lebanon and Switzerland — that still shields bank accounts from tax authorities. This archaic regime protects big-time evaders while imposing strict compliance on ordinary taxpayers. Lifting bank secrecy is essential to detecting illicit wealth, enforcing anti-money laundering rules, and aligning with UNCAC, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards. No honest public official has anything to fear from transparency. 3. Replace manual audit with a modern, digital, risk-based system The problem is not merely corruption inside the BIR — it is the outdated system that enables it. Manual audits enable bribery; random audits repeatedly target MSMEs; and large, well-connected taxpayers easily negotiate settlements. The Philippines must adopt a risk-based, computer-assisted audit system that leverages AI, data analytics, blockchain, third-party information, and cross-agency data to: Modern tax administrations catch tax criminals through intelligence — not harassment. 4. Hold private-sector enablers fully accountable Tax evasion is rarely committed alone. It often involves complicit accountants, contractors, brokers, and auditors who manipulate records or create sham transactions. Global frameworks — including OECD BEPS (Base erosion and profit shifting) and AML (anti-money laundering) standards — already recognize these enablers. The Philippines must do the same. 5. Use the tax code as a weapon against corruption Unexplained wealth, kickbacks, bribery, and fraudulent procurement all create taxable income. Even when graft cases stall, tax evasion charges can freeze assets, impose penalties, and permanently disqualify officials from public office. This is how the US took down organized crime. It is how countries prosecute kleptocrats. It is how the Philippines can finally end impunity. To reimagine a Philippines — and a world — without corruption, without climate change, and without poverty, we must plug the largest leak in public finance: tax evasion. The path forward is clear: No nation has ever prospered while allowing corruption to thrive. Treating tax evasion as corruption is not just good policy — it is a moral imperative. And the Philippines must lead the way. – Rappler.com Raymond “Mon” Abrea is the Global Tax Policy Expert and Chief Tax Advisor of the Asian Consulting Group (ACG).

"MANILA, Philippines – Two years after they ceased operations, news channels DZMM and Teleradyo will be revived through rebranding efforts from the Philippine Collective Media Corporation (PCMC) and Media Serbisyo Production Corporation. This was announced in a statement posted online on Thursday, May 29. PCMC will be rebranding DWPM Radyo 630 to DZMM Radyo Patrol 630, effective 8 pm on Thursday, May 29. Similarly, Media Serbisyo Production Corporation will be rebranding its Teleradyo Serbisyo program to DZMM Teleradyo. The programs will feature familiar names in broadcasting, such as Noli de Castro, Charo Santos, Doris Bigornia, and Alvin Elchico. This comes after news giant ABS-CBN, which previously owned DZMM and Teleradyo, entered a joint venture with House Speaker Martin Romualdez’s Prime Media Holdings Incorporated in 2023. The two formed a joint venture company, Media Serbisyo Production Corporation, which produces various news programs to be supplied to broadcasters, including PCMC. In May 2023, ABS-CBN announced its plans to cease operations for Teleradyo due to mounting losses, but it revived its old radio call sign and frequency, DZMM 630 kHz, under the joint venture with Romualdez’s Prime Media. This led to the launch of DWPM Radyo 630, which aired programs anchored by veteran ABS-CBN journalists. ABS-CBN lost its legislative franchise in 2020, affecting its television and radio operations. Lawmakers have sought to grant the media giant a fresh franchise, but their bills have languished in Congress. – Rappler.com",True,true,"DZMM, Teleradyo return after 2 years",https://www.rappler.com/nation/dzmm-teleradyo-comeback-may-2025/,Rappler
"In the Philippines, where education often mirrors inequality, defined by geography, cost, and the ability to be physically present, the UP Open University (UPOU) has long been a quiet disruptor. It has insisted, for nearly three decades, that quality learning should not require a change of address, a plane ticket, or an expensive life uprooted from family. But in an era still dominated by brick-and-mortar thinking, a persistent belief survives that distance learning is “less than” traditional education, that it is a fallback option rather than a first choice. UPOU challenges this thinking head-on. For the millions of Filipinos who are too busy, too far, too burdened, or too invisible for conventional schooling such as farmers, indigenous youth, working parents, and especially OFWs, open and distance learning is not a compromise. It is the only way education becomes possible. During her investiture as UPOU Chancellor last July 30, 2025, Dr. Joane Serrano delivered a speech that landed like a compass for Philippine higher education. She reminded the academic community: “Open and distance education is not just a delivery mode, but a philosophy rooted in quality, inclusion, equity, and access.” Her words echo a foundational truth that education is not truly excellent until it is accessible. In the same speech, she acknowledged the historic role of UPOU, an institution built precisely for those whom the traditional university system has struggled to reach: “We were built for the underserved, the geographically distant, the working Filipinos, the OFWs… Those whose right to UP education remains just as valid, just as urgent.” That sense of urgency is what powers UPOU’s model, one that proves excellence does not require exclusivity. One of the clearest expressions of this model is UPOU’s Ventures for International and Transformative Academia (UP VINTA) for OFWs in Taiwan, a pioneering effort that brings structured learning to Filipino migrant workers where they are. For decades, OFWs were forced to choose: earn a living abroad or continue schooling at home. UPOU finally collapses that impossible binary. In dormitories across Taiwan, OFWs can now earn certificates, build portfolios, and prepare for reintegration, not years from now, but while they work. In a world where Filipino labor travels but opportunities do not always travel with them, this is a quiet revolution. Chancellor Serrano describes UPOU as a “Transformative University of the Future”, rooted in deep values yet unafraid to break tradition. Her framework rests on four pillars: This is not future talk for its own sake, it is deeply connected to the communities UPOU serves. In one of her strongest lines, Serrano reminds us what technology should truly be for: “Technology is a tool — never the goal itself. The heart of open and distance e-learning is in the lives we touch and transform.” This is especially true in sectors like agriculture, where climate change, aging farmers, and new technologies reshape daily survival. My work with Varacco and ThinnkFarm brings me deep into the realities of farmers, many of them innovators long before formal recognition. In our Farmer Scientist Training Program, we see farmers experiment with soils, observe climate shifts, and adapt production strategies with precision and instinct. What they lack is not intelligence, but access: to scientific frameworks, digital tools, and continuous learning. UPOU can provide a bridge. Distance education allows farmers to earn microcredentials on soil health, agroforestry, sustainability analytics, or climate adaptation without leaving their farms. It respects their time, their responsibilities, and their knowledge systems. This is what the University of the Future looks like: not a futuristic building, but an education system that moves with the rhythm of real life. For IP communities in Bukidnon or farmer groups in Batangas, learning becomes rooted, happening amid ancestral lands, amid seedlings and seasons, amid responsibilities that cannot simply be paused. In 2024, I shared reflections through the Asia New Zealand Foundation’s Young Business Leaders Initiative (YBLI). There, I emphasized how exposure to global conversations, diverse mentors, and new forms of leadership shapes entrepreneurs and changemakers. But exposure should not be exclusive to those who can afford flights, conferences, or urban universities. Open and distance learning democratizes exposure. It brings the world to anyone with a mobile phone and a commitment to learn. It decentralizes opportunity and disrupts the old idea that learning is something that happens only in select cities, behind select gates. For young entrepreneurs, rural women, or returning OFWs dreaming of a different trajectory, these open doors matter. Sustainability in business is not built on products alone, it is built on people. For enterprises like Varacco and ThinnkFarm, where technology intersects with agriculture, we rely on farmers trained in data literacy, climate-smart practices, regenerative agriculture, and digital tools. That kind of workforce cannot emerge from one-off seminars or annual workshops. It requires continuous, accessible learning ecosystems, the kind UPOU has been pioneering long before distance learning became fashionable. Education becomes infrastructure. Knowledge becomes public good. Communities become capable, not dependent. And when communities grow, businesses grow with them. The ultimate question — para kanino ang edukasyon? (For whom is education?) — is the one UPOU has answered again and again through its learners. It is for CEOs and business owners working 24/7. It is for OFWs studying after a long shift abroad. It is for mothers finishing modules after putting children to sleep. It is for IP youth balancing tradition and modern knowledge. It is for farmers who are scientists in practice. It is for second-chance learners rebuilding dreams. As Chancellor Serrano powerfully declared: “Opening the doors of UP is not a gesture of generosity, it is a commitment to justice.” In a time of widening inequality and accelerating climate shocks, this commitment is no longer optional. It is essential. The University of the Future is not a place we build, it is a principle we live. One where learning travels, where technology serves people, and where no Filipino is ever too far, too old, too busy, or too marginalized to grow. Para kanino ang edukasyon? Para sa bawat Pilipinong nangangarap. Para sa Pilipinong malayo. Para sa Pilipinong bumabangon. Para sa lahat. (It is for every Filipino who dreams. For every Filipino who is faraway.

"MANILA, Philippines – The latest addition to Sunlight Air’s fleet has finally landed. The boutique airline on Friday, October 24, welcomed its first ATR 72-600 turboprop plane, the fourth aircraft in its turboprop fleet. The newer, bigger plane also spots Sunlight Air’s refurbished livery and logo. Sunlight Air’s newest aircraft has a seating capacity of 68 passengers and emits less carbon emissions per passenger as it burns 45% less fuel. The plane also contains advanced noise insulation and fewer seats to provide more legroom to its passengers. Passengers of the boutique airline may spot this new plane on its maiden flight on Sunday, October 26. It will service Sunlight’s Clark-Siargao, Siargao-Cebu, Cebu-Busuanga, and Busuanga-Clark routes. For Sunlight Air’s chief executive officer Ryna Brito-Garcia, the newest aircraft to their fleet aims to bring the boutique aviation experience to more passengers on its short-haul regional flights. “It aligns with our goal to continuously improve our services and expand our route offerings, connecting more travelers to beloved island destinations while showcasing Sunlight Air’s signature hospitality,” she said. Garcia, the country’s only female commercial airline chief, also underscored the carrier’s goal of connecting travelers to underrated destinations in the Philippines. “This new ATR 72-600 will allow us to serve you better, continue connecting communities that deserve better access, and beautiful islands that deserve better awareness,” she said. Sunlight is also set to launch its Cebu-Siquijor route in December, making the boutique airline the first to offer direct commercial flights to the island province. The carrier will be operating flights between Cebu and Siquijor four times a week. As Sunlight Air aims to further expand its operations, the boutique airline also revealed it is in talks with Airbus to purchase its first jet.

"MANILA, Philippines – The earnings of the Philippines’ leading online gaming provider DigiPlus Interactive Corporation (DigiPlus) took a hit in the third quarter of 2025 due to tighter regulations imposed by the government on the digital gaming sector. Tycoon Eusebio Tanco’s DigiPlus’ net income fell 59%, from P3.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024 to P1.7 billion for the same period this year, and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) declined by 47%, from P3.8 billion to P2 billion. “Revenues, meanwhile, contracted 23 percent to P10.05 billion on impact of tighter regulation, which required e-wallet providers to delink in-app access to licensed online gaming platforms,” DigiPlus said in a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Thursday, November 6. These e-wallet providers were mainly GCash and Maya. “This temporarily disrupted player actvity and transaction volumes across the industry during the period,” it said. DigiPlus currently dominates the Philippine online gaming sector with a market share of around 40% in the first half of 2025. It has over 40 million registered users across its digital ecosystem. These include its bingo platform BingoPlus and sports betting brand ArenaPlus. DigiPlus also has traditional perya or e-carnival games, plus online tongits, a popular local card game. DigiPlus attributes its success to its pivot in 2022 from its brick-and-mortar gaming business to digital. The latter now accounts for 90% of the company’s revenues. DigiPlus’ competitors include Playtime, OKBet, CasinoPlus, Bet88, among others. Other regulations the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) imposed on the gaming industry are: In response to the tighter government rules, DigiPlus said it partnered with CIS Bayad Center Incorporated (Bayad) to expand over-the-counter payment options nationwide for its various platforms. With the partnership signed by Tanco and Bayad chairman Ray Espinosa last month, DigiPlus users (BingoPlus, ArenaPlus, GameZone) can now top up their e-wallets via Bayad Centers and select Bayad partners nationwide. Bayad is the biggest multi-channel payment platform in the country’s outsourced payment collection industry. BingoPlus players can also cash in in their BingoPlus accounts for free via select Pay&Go kiosks nationwide. “Following its delinking from third-party payment platforms such as GCash and Maya, DigiPlus aims to strengthen its proprietary ecosystem to ensure operational independence, enhance system reliability, and support sustainable growth,” the company said. DigiPlus said it also partnered with Philippine First Insurance Co. Inc. for the country’s first surety bond program for online gaming players. The surety bond protects player balances of up to ₱1 million per player, without requiring customers to purchase a separate policy, it said. Despite the drop in its third quarter earnings, DigiPlus remained profitable for the first 9 months of 2025, with consolidated net income of P10 billion, 16% higher for the same period in 2024. Revenues went up from P51.56 billion to P66.8 billion, an increase of 30%, DigiPlus said, due to “increased business activity and the rollout of new games and licenses approved by Pagcor.” For the first three quarters of 2025, DigiPlus said it paid P25 billion in government taxes and fees, a 9% hike from the P23 billion in the same period in 2024. In the third quarter of 2025, however, DigiPlus paid P7.17 billion in taxes and fees, a decrease of 26% “due to the impact of the e-wallet delinking directive.” Tanco said its earnings for the third quarter “demonstrate(s) DigiPlus’ resilience amid temporary setbacks.” “Throughout this period, we continue to focus on digital innovation, player protection, and good governance,” he said. – Rappler.com",True,true,Earnings of Tanco’s DigiPlus take a hit with tighter gaming regulations,https://www.rappler.com/business/digiplus-interactive-earnings-report-q3-2025/,Rappler
"LONDON, United Kingdom – Global oil and gas demand could grow until 2050, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday, November 12, departing from previous expectations of a speedy transition to cleaner fuels following US criticism about its climate focus. The Paris-based energy security watchdog also predicted in its annual outlook that the world will likely fail to meet its goal to cap the rise in temperatures to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change. The IEA has been under pressure from the US for a shift in recent years toward a focus on clean energy policies as President Donald Trump called on American companies to expand oil and gas production. During the Biden administration, it predicted that global oil demand would peak this decade and said there should be an end to investment in new oil, gas and coal projects if the world wanted to reach net zero emissions by mid-century. (COP30: UN Climate Change Conference agenda, latest news) Trump’s Energy Secretary Chris Wright has called its demand peak projections “nonsensical.” The IEA is funded by member countries, with the US the largest contributor. In its World Energy Outlook published on Wednesday the IEA predicted under a current policies scenario that oil demand will hit 113 million barrels per day by mid-century, up around 13% from 2024 consumption. It predicted that global energy demand will climb by 90 exajoules by 2035 — a 15% increase from present levels. The scenario, which the IEA first used in 2019 before switching to one more in line with a clean energy transition, is based on existing government policies and not aspirations to achieve climate goals. IEA head Fatih Birol said on a press call the scenario was restored to reflect differing choices governments are making about energy. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has previously disputed peak oil demand forecasts. “We hope…we have passed the peak in the misguided notion of ‘peak oil.’” OPEC said on its website on Wednesday. This year’s outlook ditched the pledges scenario as the IEA said not enough countries had submitted new commitments to produce a meaningful picture. In the stated policies scenario, which considers proposed but not necessarily adopted policies, oil demand peaks around 2030. The difference in projections is largely due to diverging expectations of EV uptake. The IEA says its scenarios explore a range of possible outcomes under various sets of assumptions and are not forecasts. Final investment decisions for new liquefied natural gas projects have surged in 2025, the report noted. Operations for about 300 billion cubic metres of new annual LNG export capacity will start by 2030, marking a 50% increase in available supply. Based on the current policies scenario, the global LNG market increases from around 560 bcm in 2024 to 880 bcm in 2035 and to 1,020 bcm in 2050, driven by rising power sector demand fueled by data center and AI growth. Global investment in data centers is expected to reach $580 billion in 2025, the report said, noting that if achieved this would surpass the $540 billion a year spent globally on oil supply. The report includes a scenario describing a pathway to reduce global energy emissions to net zero by 2050. More than 190 countries pledged at the Paris climate talks in 2015 to try to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. The report shows the world surpassing that in all scenarios. “We need to speed up and scale up and governments at COP30 must now agree on a global response plan to urgently bridge the 1.5ºC ambition gap,” Kaisa Kosonen, senior policy adviser at Greenpeace Nordic said, referring to the UN climate talks underway in Brazil. – Rappler.com",True,true,"World oil and gas demand could grow until 2050, IEA says",https://www.rappler.com/business/world-oil-gas-demand-grow-until-2050-report/,Rappler
"The Lucio Co Group’s full-control acquisition of PrimeWater marks a pivotal consolidation in the Philippine water sector, underscoring how essential utilities have become strategic, defensive assets for large conglomerates. By bringing one of the country’s largest private water portfolios under Crystal Bridges Holding Corporation, the deal signals a shift toward scale, balance-sheet strength, and long-term capital commitment in a sector strained by aging infrastructure, climate risk, and fragmented ownership. While the transaction is legally sound despite the undisclosed purchase price, it sharpens investor and regulatory focus on governance, transparency, and the treatment of public water district partners whose assets and consumers are directly affected by any change in control. Beyond market impact, the acquisition places responsibility squarely on Crystal Bridges to address PrimeWater’s long-standing operational and consumer service challenges. Service reliability, non-revenue water, billing disputes, and wastewater compliance are not peripheral issues but core financial and reputational risks. Lucio Co’s credibility and capital discipline give it the opportunity to reset standards through visible investment, clearer performance benchmarks, and greater disclosure — turning PrimeWater from a politically sensitive operator into a predictable, accountable utility. Ultimately, the success of the deal will be judged, not by consolidation alone, but by whether scale is translated into better service, restored trust, and sustainable returns in one of the country’s most critical sectors. The Lucio Co Group’s buyout of PrimeWater Infrastructure Corporation (PrimeWater) from the Villar family is being brandied as a straightforward consolidation play in a capital-hungry sector. But Vantage Point sees it as something more significant. It reshapes power dynamics in the Philippine water industry, exposes lingering governance fault lines, and forces a reckoning on a question that utilities cannot escape forever: whether scale and capital alone can repair trust once consumers have lost it. PrimeWater is not a marginal asset. It operates one of the country’s largest private water portfolios, spanning joint ventures with local water districts, bulk water supply, septage, and wastewater management across fast-growing urban and provincial areas. Folding that platform into Crystal Bridges, the Lucio Co Group’s investment vehicle, effectively transfers control of a critical slice of the country’s water infrastructure to one of the Philippines’ most disciplined capital allocators. For the market, the signal is unmistakable. Regulated utilities, once dismissed as slow and politically messy, are now being treated as core defensive assets, prized for long-duration cash flows in an economy where volatility is the norm rather than the exception. This transaction reinforces a broader consolidation trend. Water infrastructure is becoming too capital-intensive, too regulated, and too exposed to climate stress for fragmented ownership structures to survive. Operators need balance sheets that can absorb pipe rehabilitation, wastewater compliance, and non-revenue water losses without lurching from one tariff petition to the next. From that perspective, the entry of Lucio Co into full control of PrimeWater may ultimately strengthen the sector by forcing weaker operators and underfunded water districts to confront the true cost of service delivery. Yet markets do not price infrastructure on assets alone. They price governance, transparency, and execution risk. And this is where the PrimeWater deal becomes more complicated. The acquisition price was not disclosed. In a purely private transaction, that omission is not, by itself, illegal. Philippine law does not compel private companies to publish valuation details unless they are publicly traded or listed on the stock exchange, or if the disclosure directly impacts public shareholders. But legality is not the same as adequacy. PrimeWater’s business model is deeply intertwined with public assets through water district joint ventures that are subject to state audit and regulatory oversight. Any change in control that affects capital structure, risk allocation, or investment commitments reverberates beyond shareholders and into the public sphere. This is where governance questions begin to surface. If PrimeWater carried significant related-party funding, guarantees, or contingent liabilities under its previous ownership, regulators will want to know how those exposures are being unwound — or whether they are simply being transferred to a new sponsor with deeper pockets. (READ: White flag? Why the Villars want out of PrimeWater) If listed entities related to Villar or Co were indirectly involved through loans, guarantees, or receivables, disclosure obligations do not vanish simply because the transaction headline says “private.” The real test will be whether the transaction leaves behind clean financial boundaries or merely shifts complexity out of sight. For Crystal Bridges, the strategic rationale is clear, but the operational inheritance is less forgiving. PrimeWater has faced sustained consumer complaints over service reliability, billing disputes, and wastewater compliance. These are not public-relations problems; they are balance-sheet issues waiting to happen. Chronic underinvestment in maintenance shows up first as leaks and service interruptions, then later as emergency capital expenditure (CapEx), regulatory penalties, or political backlash. Non-revenue water is not just water lost to leaks—it is revenue lost to inefficiency, often masked by accounting profits that do not translate into cash. This is where Lucio Co’s reputation becomes an asset, if it is deployed deliberately. Crystal Bridges can address PrimeWater’s consumer problems only by breaking with the legacy playbook that treats water districts as captive partners rather than stakeholders. The most immediate fix is capital discipline: ring-fenced funding for pipe rehabilitation, wastewater upgrades, and metering modernization that is visibly tied to service improvements, not just expansion announcements. Consumers do not experience EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). They experience pressure, continuity, and billing accuracy. Equally important is governance at the operating level. PrimeWater’s joint ventures need clearer performance metrics, transparent tariff logic, and predictable dispute-resolution mechanisms. Crystal Bridges has the institutional credibility to impose standardized service benchmarks across regions, replacing the patchwork approach that has fueled uneven performance and public frustration. Doing so would not only reduce regulatory risk, but also stabilize cash flows through the alignment of consumer trust with revenue sustainability. The acquisition also offers an opportunity to reset disclosure norms. Even if not legally required, greater transparency around CapEx commitments, service targets, and financial health would send a powerful signal to regulators and water districts alike. (READ: PrimeWater probe covers ‘possible conflict’ of DPWH under Mark Villar) In essential utilities, opacity breeds suspicion, and suspicion eventually attracts intervention. Lucio Co’s long-term advantage lies in making PrimeWater boring in the best possible way: predictable, compliant, and visibly accountable. The market impact of this deal therefore is not confined to ownership charts. It raises the bar for how private capital participates in public-facing utilities. If Crystal Bridges succeeds, it could accelerate consolidation, while restoring confidence that private operators can deliver both returns and reliability. If it fails, it will reinforce the argument that water infrastructure is simply too sensitive to be governed by balance sheets alone. In the end, Co is not just acquiring pipes and concessions. He is buying a relationship with millions of consumers and dozens of public institutions. The true valuation of PrimeWater will not be measured by the undisclosed purchase price, but by whether the new owner can convert scale into service, capital into credibility, and consolidation into confidence within consumers who expect clean and clear water to flow steadily from their taps. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] Lucio Co’s PrimeWater bet: The price of trust,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-lucio-co-buys-manny-villar-primewater-price-trust/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Chinese smugglers, Philippine government officials and employees, and local businessmen are “in connivance” to bring in millions worth of misdeclared agricultural goods in the country, Senator Francis “Kiko” Pangilinan said on Monday, October 20. Pangilinan, head of the Senate committee on agriculture, food, and agrarian reform, has been leading an investigation into smuggling and prices of food commodities, such as imported rice and fish. Officials and employees from the Bureau of Customs, National Bureau of Investigation, Philippine National Police, Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Justice, and the Bureau of Immigration “allow these Chinese smugglers and their local partners to operate freely,” Pangilinan said during a Senate hearing on Monday. “Unti-unting nabubunyag ang bulok na sistema kung saan mga dummy consignee at insiders nagsasabwatan kasama ang ilang mga opisyal ng Customs, at posible rin taga-DA,” said Pangilinan. (Slowly the rotten system is being exposed, where there are dummy consignees and insiders colluding with officials from Customs and possibly even from the Department of Agriculture.) The government had seized containers of misdeclared goods coming from China. The products smuggled in and eventually seized by the government were white and red onions and frozen mackerel. Pangilinan said these seizures were only done “to show a semblance of law enforcement while ensuring that no big-time smuggler is prosecuted for the non-bailable offense of economic sabotage.” Smuggling is one of the crimes considered as “economic sabotage” under the Anti-Agricultural Economic Sabotage Act, which President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed in September 2024. During Monday’s hearing, Pangilinan identified the following Chinese exporters who smuggle misdeclared goods into the Philippines: Last July, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said they intend to conduct risk assessment of shipments coming from China. It was on the same day that the Bureau of Customs seized containers of smuggled onions and frozen mackerel from China declared as mantou, egg noodles, and kimchi. According to Tiu Laurel in September, the DA had led 182 anti-smuggling operations between January 2024 and July 2025. This resulted in the seizure of P3.78 billion worth of illegal agricultural and fishery goods, the statement from DA said. The agriculture department does not have enforcement authority and has only been able to blacklist several agricultural importers so far. Misdeclaring agricultural products as food products help exporters and consignees evade more stringent regulations. – Rappler.com",True,true,Chinese smugglers ‘operate freely’ with help of PH gov’t officials — Pangilinan,https://www.rappler.com/business/chinese-smugglers-operate-freely-help-government-officials-philippines-pangilinan/,Rappler
"Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) engineers and contractors engaged in a number of infrastructure projects are the new faces of corruption in the Philippines — and deservedly so. But there’s an upside to Filipino engineers and their work. Many of our engineers have helped build solid infrastructures here and abroad. Many countries in the Middle East, in particular, have long recognized the contributions of Filipino professionals — engineers, architects, and other occupations — in building their infrastructures. For instance, in this year’s award of top engineers and architects in the Middle East 2025 by the news publication The Filipino Times, Philippine Ambassador to Oman Raul Hernandez said: “From groundbreaking designs to engineering feats that shape skylines and transform cities, their work is a source of pride for our nation, proving that Filipinos’ talent and expertise shine on the global stage.” Here in the Philippines, a number of conglomerates and their partners have put up flood control projects that highlight the good side of Philippine infrastructure. They exemplify the skills, talents, and hard work of Filipino engineers and architects, proving that under the right conditions, they do a good job. Some of these projects hit two birds with one stone: while serving its main purpose of controlling floods and saving lives and property, they double as parks that we badly need amid urbanization and climate change. Take the case of property and township builder Megaworld. Kevin Tan, executive director of Megaworld, recently uploaded a video of a flood control project in Megaworld’s 35-hectare township in San Fernando, Pampanga — the 2-hectare Rainwater Park in Capital Town. The facility can hold 3.7 million gallons of water equivalent to 6 Olympic-size swimming pools. Tan describes it as an “innovative approach that manages stormwater, protects surrounding communities, and creates a vibrant hub for leisure and tourism,” and “because of this, the area around Capital Town no longer experiences flooding.” Since its opening on May 6, 2025, the Rainwater Park, designed by landscape architect Paolo Alcazaren, has become a popular spot for recreation and community interactions, attracting around 200,000 guests monthly for Capital Town. Although the video is also meant to help sell Megaworld’s properties, it also gives a sense of hope during this time of the country’s worst corruption scandal. Similarly, the Ayala Group also recently highlighted a flood control project called the Rain Garden in its 46-hectare Vertis North property beside TriNoma in Quezon City. You can watch it in this video below: A post shared by Ayala Land (@ayalaland) Many are unaware that such a park exists given that it’s partly hidden from the busy TriNoma mall. “What looks like a peaceful green space doubles as a detention pond, designed to manage rainwater, prevent flooding, and protect the estate from erosion, all the while creating a serene view within the city,” says property developer Ayala Land in a social media post. Ayala Land had intentionally built the Rain Garden due to the flooding concerns in the area. It now also serves as a central park which people can use for exercise. Another good project that’s often been cited in light of the flood control scandal is the underground storm water reservoir beneath Burgos Circle in Forbes Town, Bonifacio Global City (BGC), Taguig. This project is a 60-meter-diameter reservoir that can hold 22,000 cubic meters of storm water, helping keep BGC flood-free. Burgos Circle is the lowest point in BGC, and the rainwater the facility collects eventually drains to Manila Bay. On top of the reservoir is a small round park with the Instagrammable The Trees sculpture by Reynato Paz Contreras. The Sy family has long been recognized for incorporating the problem of flooding in their projects. Who can forget how their SM City Marikina mall survived the catastrophic flooding caused by Tropical Storm Ondoy (Ketsana) on September 26, 2009? While half of Marikina City saw their properties ravaged by flood waters, SM Marikina stood above the disaster, becoming a symbol of disaster preparedness and scientific environmental planning. The 6-hectare SM City Marikina is built on top of stilts in an area that had been identified as high-risk to floods. Property developer SM Prime built its Marikina mall farther than the recommended 90-meter-distance from the Marikina River centerline to reduce the risk of mall damage in case of extreme floods. SM Marikina’s lower parking level has no wall enclosures, and its ground floor level was built 20.5 meters higher than the maximum flood level that had been recorded. “These features allowed water to flow freely through the parking structure while the mall area rests on the third floor lifted by the supportive stilts during extreme floods,” according to a case study on the project. The steps taken by mall developer SM Prime on SM City Marikina’s disaster resiliency resulted in avoidance of around P1 billion in losses from business sales alone during Ondoy. SM Prime says the “additional 15% in costs to build a disaster-resilient mall were more than recouped in avoided losses.” SM Prime has cited two other case studies of disaster-resilient malls: SM City Masinag in Antipolo City, Rizal province, and SM City Cabanatuan in Nueva Ecija province, both of which are in flood-prone locations. SM City Cabanatuan’s ground level parking area serves as a temporary catch basin for water that overflows from a nearby creek. The facility can hold 14 million gallons of flood water. It served its purpose during Typhoon Lando on October 18, 2015 when most of Cabanatuan City got flooded. SM Investments told Rappler that 30 of its 89 malls have rainwater catchment basins with a total capacity of 85,6010 cubic meters, equivalent to 34 Olympic size swimming pools. “These massive underground tanks, similar in size to swimming pools, collect and store rainwater from the street level, mitigating flooding in surrounding communities,” SM Supermalls said. In the case of SM City Masinag, its catchment basin collected 8,652 cubic meters of rainwater during Typhoon Carina (Gaemi) in July 2024. The town of Masinag is a flood-prone area because of the rainwater that flows toward it from upper Antipolo. SM City Masinag’s rainwater catch basin has helped solve flooding in villages such as the nearby Vermont Park Executive Village. These projects by SM Prime have been cited as models of disaster risk management in the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction ARISE Private Sector Alliance, where SM Prime’s Hans Sy has played an active role in the international board. So, why aren’t the engineering/architectural firms behind these notable flood control projects generally not involved in public works? Those in the know say the good guys don’t participate in bidding for public works projects since they’re aware they have to give bribes in order to win. Or, they know the biddings are rigged and thus don’t participate. Some of the big ones, especially the companies that are publicly listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange, don’t bother at all due to their good corporate governance principles and practices. How then should the Philippines move forward from the flood control scandal? Aside from all the steps now being taken on making the bad guys account for their misdeeds, one key reform measure that is needed but hasn’t been discussed sufficiently is how to inculcate integrity in the DPWH. The key steps needed are to professionalize the bureaucracy, institute meritocracy, remove the influence of politicians in appointments, and inculcate the value of good governance. I recently came across an article, “What is happening to our government civil engineers?” by former DPWH engineer Alvin Claridades, who related his sad encounter with an apparently corrupt former colleague in the agency. In his piece, he says: “If the government truly wishes to ‘build better,’ it must begin by rebuilding the morale, integrity, and dignity of its engineers. “Our civil engineers are not the problem; they are part of the solution. Given the right environment — one that values competence, shields integrity, and enforces accountability — they can once again become the vanguards of public trust and technical excellence. “Infrastructure is not merely about concrete and steel — it is about conscience, competence, and commitment.” This reminds me of what former finance secretary Jesus Estanislao, a strong advocate of reforms, once said, “My advocacy is good governance: corporate governance in the business sector; public governance in the government sector; family governance for families; school governance for school institutions; and personal governance for individuals. At the end of the day, it is governance at the personal level that makes a vital difference.” – Rappler.com Click below for other BizSights articles:",True,true,[BizSights] Not all flood control projects are bad.

"MANILA, Philippines – Ayala Land Incorporated (ALI) has sold its 50% ownership of Alabang Commercial Center to the Madrigal family for P13.5 billion. (READ: Jamby Madrigal: Unafraid to pick a fight) The Alabang Commercial Center Corporation owns and operates Alabang Town Center, a pioneer mall in Muntinlupa City, south of Manila. In a disclosure on Tuesday, December 16, the Zobel de Ayalas’ property company said the share purchase agreement was with its existing joint venture partner and is subject to customary closing conditions. ALI said the Madrigals made an unsolicited offer which “provided a premium, allowing ALI to recognize gains from the sale and monetize its stake in Alabang Town Center.” It added that “proceeds from the sale will fuel further growth” in its “leasing portfolio and provide our stakeholders with return of capital.” In a disclosure on Wednesday, December 17, Ayala Land identified the buyer of all of its shares in Alabang Commercial Corporation as Francisco Madrigal Bayot Jr. Meantime, the Lopez-owned Rockwell Land Corporation confirmed on Wednesday that it was in talks with “one of the Madrigals” to redevelop the Alabang Town Center. It said this was “in line with Rockwell Land’s continuous search for properties to develop.” In the early 1970s, the Madrigal family offered to sell a big tract of land in Alabang to Ayala Corporation, then headed by Enrique Zobel. The two groups decided on a joint venture to develop the 661-hectare agricultural land into a residential-commercial district. (TRIVIA: What some of the richest Filipinos have in common) The area now houses the Alabang Town Center, Ayala Alabang Village, and the Madrigal Business Center District, an area considered to be a symbol of progress and prosperity south of the capital. Ayala Land says it is the “largest and most diversified real estate conglomerate in the Philippines,” with projects in large-scale residential and industrial estates, malls, hotels and resorts. It had 53 estates as of end 2024.

"NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – For some 140,000 small sugar planters in Negros Occidental, this will not be a merry Christmas. Plunging local sugar prices have erased hopes of decent holiday earnings, leaving the mostly agrarian reform beneficiaries, facing a bleak start to the new year. On Thursday, December 18, millgate bid prices per 50-kilogram bag of sugar on Negros Island averaged P2,130 to P2,200, around P380 lower than the supposed production cost. Universal Robina Sugar Milling Corporation in Negros Oriental offered the lowest bid at P2,130 per bag, while First Farmers Holding Corporation in Talisay City, Negros Occidental, posted the highest at P2,292.19 per bag. Lucio Tan-led Victorias Milling Company, Asia’s biggest sugar refinery, maintained a steady price of P2,200 per bag, while the Jose Marie Chan-owned Binalbagan-Isabela Sugar Company offered P2,155 per bag. Current millgate bid prices are slightly below October’s average of P2,250, two weeks after 424,000 metric tons of imported refined sugar arrived in the country. Saul Casiple, a small sugar planter in Victorias City and EB Magalona, told Rappler on Friday, December 19, that he was severely affected by the declining prices. “It’s okay for the big planters because they have extra capital. But for us small ones, it’s truly pitiable,” he said. Last week, Casiple milled 50,000 tons of harvest for a total of P150,000. Milling costs amounted to P40,000, while planting and growing expenses – including wages, fertilizers, and pesticides – further reduced his income. “We’re really losing or even if we were in a break-even, still, it will lead us to look for additional capital in the next cropping period because part of our present income now has been allotted already for our food, among other expenses,” Casiple said. Expenses for a single hectare of sugarcane range from P80,000 to P90,000 for new plantings and P60,000 to P70,000 for ratooned crops. “Add the planting, growing and milling expenses – the current sugar pricing will not really compensate our overall spending,” he added. Mayors from 31 towns and cities in Negros Occidental have called for immediate government intervention. Cadiz City Mayor Salvador Escalante Jr., president of the Association of Chief Executives (ACE) in Negros Occidental, said the Marcos administration should not ignore the crisis, especially since the most affected are needy agrarian reform beneficiaries. Negros Occidental produces 60% of the country’s sugar but thousands of small planters and laborers are facing low or no income due to poor prices. Negros Occidental Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson urged stakeholders to unite and prevent further declines in sugar prices. “Together, let us act with firm determination to safeguard the livelihood of our farmers, workers and communities,” he said. Excessive sugar imports are cited as a primary cause of the crisis. The government imported 424,000 metric tons of refined sugar under Sugar Order No. 08 (SO8), which arrived in mid-September, surprising local producers. Sugar planters’ federations had requested only 150,000 metric tons. The resulting surplus is causing significant revenue losses. The Confederation of Sugar Producers Association (CONFED) reported forgone revenues of P4.2 billion as of November 23. With current prices, CONFED projects losses could reach P23.3 billion for Crop Year 2025-2026. Negros Occidental 5th District Representative Emilio Bernardino “Dino” Yulo III, a former Sugar Regulatory Administration official, said the pricing trend is “bad” for small planters, especially during the holiday season. He said the small planters’ primary concern is earning enough to cover daily expenses and pay field workers. Lower millgate prices make it difficult to cover fertilizer, pesticide, and labor costs, he said. “SRA should look into their plight,” Yulo said. “We feel them. We pity them.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Negros sugar planters face bleak holidays as millgate prices plummet,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/negros-occidental-sugar-planters-millgate-price-drop-december-18-2025/,Rappler
"BENGALURU, India – At a startup office in this Indian city, developers are fine-tuning artificial intelligence chatbots that talk and message like humans. The company, LimeChat, has an audacious goal: to make customer-service jobs almost obsolete. It says its generative AI agents enable clients to slash by 80% the number of workers needed to handle 10,000 monthly queries. “Once you hire a LimeChat agent, you never have to hire again,” Nikhil Gupta, its 28-year-old co-founder, told Reuters. Cheap labor and English proficiency helped make India the world’s back office — sometimes at the expense of workers elsewhere. Now, AI-powered systems are subsuming jobs done by headset-wearing graduates in technical support, customer care, and data management, sparking a scramble to adapt, a Reuters examination found. That’s driving business for AI startups that help companies slash staffing costs and scale operations — even though many consumers still prefer to deal with a person. This account of the disruptive changes transforming India’s $283 billion IT sector is based on interviews with 30 people, including industry executives, recruiters, workers and current and former government officials. Reuters also visited two AI startups and tested voice and text chatbots that handle increasingly sophisticated customer interactions in human-like ways. Rather than pump the brakes as the technology threatens jobs built on routine tasks, the country is accelerating, wagering that a let-it-rip approach will create enough new opportunities to absorb those displaced, Reuters found. The outcome of India’s gamble carries weight far beyond its borders — a test case for whether embracing AI-driven disruption can elevate a developing economy or render it a cautionary tale. The global conversational AI market is growing 24% a year and should reach $41 billion by 2030, consultancy Grand View Research estimates. India — which relies on IT for 7.5% of its GDP — is leaning in. In a February speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said “work does not disappear due to technology. Its nature changes and new types of jobs are created.” Not everyone shares Modi’s confidence in India’s preparedness. Santosh Mehrotra, a former Indian official and visiting professor at the University of Bath’s Centre for Development Studies, criticized the government for a lack of urgency in assessing AI’s effects on India’s young workforce. “There’s no gameplan,” he said. Business process management employs 1.65 million workers in call centers, payroll, and data handling in India. Hiring has plummeted due to increased automation and digitalization, despite rising demand for AI coordinators and process analysts, said Neeti Sharma, CEO of staffing firm TeamLease Digital. Net headcount in the segment, which represents one-fifth of IT output, grew by fewer than 17,000 workers in each of the past two years, down from 130,000 in 2022-2023 and 177,000 in 2021-2022, TeamLease Digital figures show. Reuters spoke to three current and five former customer-service workers, who described increasing job insecurity and integration of AI, including tools that suggest responses and bots that handle nearly all routine queries autonomously. Megha S., 32, was earning $10,000 a year at a Bengaluru-based software solutions provider. She said she was laid off last month, just before India’s festive season, as the company moved to implement AI tools to review the quality of sales calls. “I was told I am the first one who has been replaced by AI,” said Megha, who spoke on the condition that her full name and former employer not be identified. “I’ve not told my parents.” Sumita Dawra, a former labor ministry secretary who oversaw an Indian government taskforce on AI’s impact on the workforce before retiring in March, said while the technology offered productivity gains that would lead to new jobs, India could consider stronger social security measures, such as unemployment benefits, to help those displaced during the transition. However, a senior Indian official told Reuters the government believed AI would ultimately have little impact on overall employment. India’s IT and labor ministries, and Modi’s office, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Besides AI, factors clouding the outlook for India’s IT sector include US tariffs; a proposal by a US lawmaker for a 25% tax on firms using foreign outsourcing services; and President Trump’s $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas, which are widely used by tech firms to sponsor Indian workers. Investment bank Jefferies predicted in September that India’s call centers would face a revenue hit of 50% — and around 35% for other back-office functions — from AI adoption over the next five years. That would spell near-term job losses in India, which accounts for 52% of the global outsourcing market. “The biggest impact is going to be on young students coming out of college,” said Pramod Bhasin, who in the 1990s established India’s first call center with 18 employees for GE Capital, where workstations were partitioned by saris strung from the ceiling. In the longer run, India could transition from “back office” to the world’s “AI factory” by capitalizing on demand for AI engineers and automation deployment, said Bhasin, who went on to found IT services firm Genpact. One beneficiary of that demand is LimeChat, which Reuters visited in August. Gupta, the co-founder, said his developers and engineers have helped automate 5,000 jobs across India. The company’s bots handle 70% of customer complaints for its clients, and it plans to achieve 90-95% within a year, he said. “If you’re giving us 100,000 rupees per month, you are automating the job of at least 15 agents,” said Gupta. At that price — about $1,130 — the service costs roughly the same as three customer-care staff, he said. LimeChat’s sales soared to $1.5 million in 2024 from $79,000 two years earlier, regulatory disclosures show. Last year, the firm began integrating Microsoft’s Azure language models and algorithms in a partnership to launch a new e-commerce chatbot. Among Gupta’s clients is Indian ayurvedic products firm Kapiva, which has deployed a LimeChat bot for customer interactions over WhatsApp. Keying in a prompt — “What kind of diet should I have to reduce weight?” — yielded an AI meal-plan creator. A follow-up query in English and Hindi about how a slimming juice differs from another item was also answered, with the chatbot eventually sharing links to Kapiva products with a smiling emoji. Kapiva didn’t respond to Reuters questions. LimeChat’s rivals include Reliance, the conglomerate chaired by Mukesh Ambani, which acquired Indian startup Haptik in 2019. Haptik says it offers “AI agents that deliver human-like customer experiences” that cost $120 and can cut support costs by 30%. Revenue skyrocketed to almost $18 million last year from less than $1 million in 2020, disclosures show. Haptik promoted a webinar in September by posing the question: “What if you had a full-time employee who never sleeps and costs just 10,000 rupees?” “We are seeing a huge shift,” Haptik product manager Suji Ravi said in the webinar, which Reuters reporters attended. “Brands are not investing in human agents and they want to deploy AI agents.” For LimeChat client Mamaearth, an Indian personal-care brand, the main attraction of AI chatbots is scalability, said Vipul Maheshwari, head of product and analytics at parent firm Honasa Consumer. “Providing good customer support is make or break for us,” he said. “But can we infinitely scale my customer support team? Absolutely not.” The chatbot used by Mamaearth could go beyond simple assistance like order tracking, and help users with queries such as recommending the right products during pregnancy or, in some cases, handle an agitated customer, Maheshwari said. The promise and perils of AI are evident at The Media Ant. The Bengaluru-based advertising agency cut 40% of its workforce to about 100 over the past year and vacated space in another building to save on rent, said founder Samir Chaudhary. The firm eliminated 15 salespeople, replacing them with AI bots that identify leads and send emails to prospective customers, Chaudhary said. A six-member call center was replaced with a voice agent called Neha that speaks in near-flawless, Indian-accented English. When a Reuters reporter asked Neha about advertising on YouTube, she sought details about the budget and target markets, noted the requirements, and ended the conversation cheerfully: “I will email you the details … have a great day.” “Ask her out for a coffee and she will laugh it off,” Chaudhary said. Yet the race to embrace AI isn’t always smooth for companies. Take Sweden’s Klarna. Chatbots helped the fintech firm cut thousands of jobs last year, but its CEO told Reuters in September the company is now “trying to course correct” and use the technology to improve products rather than reduce costs. Chatbots have limitations. While most generic e-commerce-related queries posed by a Reuters reporter were handled well by LimeChat bots, some stumped them. When LimeChat client Knya’s bot was asked for proof of its claim that a million medical professionals trust its products, such as its stethoscopes, it replied: “I am sorry, I don’t have enough information to answer your question.” Knya didn’t respond to a request for comment. Customer surveys show chatbots are still disliked by many. An August 2024 EY survey of 1,000 Indian consumers found 62% made purchases influenced by AI recommendations, compared with 30% globally. Yet, “the desire for a human connection remains strong,” EY noted, with 78% preferring online platforms that provide human support. LimeChat’s Gupta, though, said well-trained AI agents could resolve queries faster than humans. He said many standard bots pass conversations to a human agent when they encounter angry customers: “You need a very small number of people to just handle negative experiences.” In the 1990s and 2000s, India’s tech boom fueled rural-to-urban migration. Cities like Bengaluru became outsourcing hubs as domestic firms, including Tata Consultancy Services TCS.NS, Infosys INFY.NS and Wipro WIPR.NS, grew into global juggernauts. That expansion trickled through to Ameerpet, a Hyderabad neighborhood where university graduates fill classrooms to learn IT skills and earn certifications for tech jobs. Ameerpet’s training centers traditionally offered courses in Microsoft Office and programming languages like Java. Visiting in April, Reuters found these centers are increasingly focused on AI training. Outside one, Quality Thought, a banner featured a robot overlooking a globe with the letters “AI.” The center was offering a nine-month course in AI data science and prompt engineering for about $1,360, more than double the price of a traditional web-development program. “Recruiters are asking for students with basic AI skills,” staffer Priyanka Kandulapati said. “We are going to streamline our courses even further to suit the demand.” In a discussion with startup founders last month about the pace of change, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, who co-founded Sun Microsystems, offered a stark view of the future for India. “All IT services will be replaced in the next five years,” he said. “It’s going to be pretty chaotic.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Meet the AI chatbots replacing India’s call center workers,https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/ai-chatbots-replace-india-call-center-workers/,Rappler
"In a country where over six million Filipinos still lack a place to call home, “affordable housing” often translates to rows of cramped, concrete boxes built on the fringes of society. But what if businesses treated housing not as a cost or compliance issue, but as a mission, a means to restore dignity to Filipino families? At the 2025 PHINMA Policy Forum, thought leaders and changemakers from business, academe, and civil society gathered to confront this question. The conversation moved beyond mere statistics; it became a collective call to reimagine what “home” means, and how business can be a force for building it. The event’s overarching theme, “Business as a Force for Good,” challenged companies to look beyond the bottom line and toward the lives that their industries touch. Housing, after all, is not just a social issue, it is a measure of how we value our people. And as the discussions revealed, addressing it requires both heart and strategy, both compassion and commitment. As Dr. Stan Padojinog of the University of Asia and the Pacific emphasized, the housing crisis is not only about shelter but about survival. Demographic shifts, declining fertility rates, delayed household formation, and an aging population, have reshaped the country’s economic landscape. “We are aging while still poor,” he warned. Without strong investments in housing and community infrastructure, the Philippines risks growing old before it grows prosperous. Housing, Padojinog explained, is a powerful economic multiplier. It stimulates industries from construction to finance, while providing stability for families to pursue education and employment. Yet, production has fallen short for decades. The backlog, now 6.5 million homes, represents not only lost opportunities but also deepening inequality. For him, the solution lies in “management by mission,” where businesses operate not solely for profit but guided by a higher purpose. When profit is aligned with impact, both enterprise and society thrive. His point was clear: the housing deficit is not just a policy gap; it’s a mission waiting for business to embrace. As stated by PHINMA Community Housing vice president, Luis Oquiñena, the challenge goes beyond construction. “The goal is to move past the ‘pwede na’ (that’ll do) mentality,” he said, “and create a new, dignified standard for socialized housing.” His message cut through the usual policy talk, it was both an invitation and a reckoning. For too long, socialized housing has been treated as a checkbox on government agendas or a corporate social responsibility add-on. Oquiñena argues that it must instead be rooted in purpose and empathy. He described PHINMA Community Housing’s approach as one that goes beyond simply building houses. It’s about building communities, places where families can thrive, not just survive. The goal is to create neighborhoods that nurture life: homes with light and space, access to training centers, and even daycare hubs so parents can work and children can learn. He envisions a community sustained by bayanihan, where cooperation becomes a new currency and dignity a shared value. For him, it’s not just about policy or profit, but about building a movement, one that turns socialized housing into a collective act of nation-building. From the perspective of Carl Andrew Siy of the Pag-IBIG Fund, the problem is not that we lack policy frameworks, it’s that we fail to connect the dots. With programs like the expanded 4PH initiative and updated price ceilings already in place, the question now is how to execute them effectively and at scale. During the panel discussion, co-panelist and host lawyer Third Bagro posed a crucial question: “Are we in crisis mode?” The answer, perhaps, is yes, and that acknowledgment is where transformation begins. Siy highlighted that while financing mechanisms exist, accessibility and land availability remain major hurdles. There are funds that remain untapped and policies that, though well-intentioned, do not always reach the people who need them most. His insights underscored the need for better coordination among government, developers, and communities, not to reinvent the system, but to make it work as intended. In the end, the challenge is not a lack of resources, but a need for stronger collaboration and follow-through. After all the talk of policy, finance, and business models, the forum’s most powerful argument came not from an expert, but from a father. For ten years, Ruben worked as a utility man, messenger, and driver, dreaming of the day he could give his wife and child a home of their own. His testimony became the unassailable ‘why’ behind this entire mission, a reminder that the numbers we discuss represent real lives and real dreams. He spoke softly of his fears, his humble expectations, and the overwhelming emotion of seeing a home that was not just pwede na, but built with care and pride. “Simple lang ‘yung bahay (The house is just simple),” he said, holding back tears, “pero iba ‘yung dating para sa amin (but it’s impact on us is different).” His words embodied everything the forum sought to achieve: the belief that dignity must never be optional. It is the reason we must reject the status quo and demand something better. As Ruben so powerfully declared, it is time we build a nation where there are “walang squatter sa sariling bayan” — no squatter in one’s own country. That vision, born not of policy but of lived experience, must anchor the mission ahead. Building dignified housing is not charity; it is justice. It is a declaration that Filipino families deserve more than makeshift roofs and narrow rooms, they deserve spaces that reflect hope, humanity, and home. The forum ended not with finality, but with resolve. If the business sector can transform classrooms and industries, it can also transform the very concept of home. The task now is to unite, government, private sector, and citizens, under a shared promise: that progress will no longer leave anyone outside the gate. Because to build dignified homes is to build a dignified nation, one where “pwede na” is no longer enough, and where every Filipino finally belongs. – Rappler.com Madriella Denise Allison L.

"Every Filipino loves a good story of triumph. We celebrate people who rise above hardship because it reminds us of our own struggles and our own hopes. It reassures us that no matter where we come from or what we face, we can still move forward. This is why the journey of a group of athletes from Cebu deserves attention. The Philippine Accessible Disability Services (PADS) Adaptive Dragon Boat Team recently competed in the Penang International Dragon Boat Regatta 2025, delivering a performance that reflected not only athletic excellence but also the quiet, determined resilience that defines so many Filipinos. The PADS Adaptive Dragon Boat Team is the living expression of a mission that empowers persons with disabilities (PWDs). Competing at the Penang International Dragon Boat Regatta 2025, the team delivered an extraordinary showing. They captured gold in the Dragon Boat Tug-of-War International Premier Open, earned silver in both the Junior U24 and Senior 400-meter races, and secured bronze finishes in the U24 Premier Open and Senior 250-meter small boat categories. Their success in Penang reflects years of discipline, belief, and the conviction that ability flourishes when people are treated with fairness and respect. The team is composed of persons with disabilities who have been uplifted through education, community engagement, capacity building, and inclusive advocacy. They have grown within an environment that strengthens human rights awareness, promotes Filipino Sign Language, encourages civic participation, and provides inclusive spaces for rehabilitation and adaptive sports. In every training session, every community activity, and every race they join, the team affirms a single principle: dignity and opportunity belong to every person. Their achievement offers lessons far beyond sport. Watching athletes who have faced significant physical and social barriers paddle with such unity challenges us to reconsider the limitations we place on others and even on ourselves. Their journey shows that resilience thrives in every corner of the Philippines, yet access to opportunity does not. Many Filipinos have extraordinary potential, but potential only becomes progress when society builds pathways where individuals can succeed. The triumph of the PADS team is a powerful reminder of what becomes possible when encouragement, opportunity, and community intersect. This understanding is important for the business sector. Companies are rooted in the communities that sustain them. Their growth and stability depend on the dignity, inclusiveness, and wellbeing of the people around them. When groups like the PADS Adaptive Dragon Boat Team advocate for accessibility, representation, and equal rights, they strengthen the foundations on which businesses thrive. A nation where persons with disabilities can learn, communicate, participate, and excel becomes more cohesive and more capable. Supporting organizations that uplift others is not simply a charitable gesture. It is an acknowledgment that genuine progress is shared progress and that the success of any enterprise is intertwined with the wellbeing of the society it serves. This is the same belief that guides the support extended by Immuni Global Incorporated to initiatives rooted in dignity and inclusion. Through ImmuniPlus, which serves as the official Recovery Partner of the PADS Adaptive Dragon Boat Team, this commitment is expressed through practical support that helps athletes sustain their performance, endurance, and wellbeing. The partnership reflects a conviction that when an organization dedicates itself to empowering others, the responsibility of business is to help reinforce that effort in ways that are respectful, meaningful, and aligned with the greater good. Standing with those who stand up for others ensures that stories like the PADS team’s victory continue to unfold. It guarantees that persons with disabilities are not left to navigate their challenges alone. It gives their achievements the strength to inspire others still waiting for recognition and opportunity. Leadership is not measured solely by strategy or performance. It is also measured by the values we uphold and the communities we choose to support. When businesses align themselves with movements that champion inclusion, they help build a culture where no individual is underestimated or excluded. The path toward a disability-inclusive Philippines continues to evolve, but the PADS Adaptive Dragon Boat Team has shown what is possible when compassion is paired with structure and when opportunity is extended to those who need it most. Their athletes demonstrate that limitations can be overcome when communities choose to invest in people rather than overlook them. Their work offers a vision of a nation where every Filipino, regardless of physical condition, is afforded the dignity and opportunity to participate fully in society. When we uplift one Filipino, we strengthen the communities around us. When we remove barriers, we allow hidden potential to emerge. And when businesses stand with those who stand up for others, we help shape a future where stories of inclusion and empowerment become not the exception, but the expectation. The victories of the PADS Adaptive Dragon Boat Team in Penang may not have dominated the national conversation, but their message is profound. They reflect the enduring strength of the Filipino spirit and remind us of the power we hold when we choose to lift one another. – Rappler.com Ralph Ray Dacay Chua is the chairman of the board and president of Immuni Global Incorporated.

"Another Villar-owned company has again come under close scrutiny. VistaREIT, Inc. (PSE: VREIT) debuted on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) in 2022, and was heralded as the next great income play for investors looking for high dividends and exposure to the country’s largest integrated property network. Sponsored by billionaire Manuel “Manny” Villar Jr., whose business empire spans real estate, retail, utilities, and financial services, VREIT’s public offering raised nearly ₱5 billion from institutional and retail investors eager for steady yields in the post-pandemic recovery.Today, VREIT’s promise of stability and transparency is crumbling. Behind its glossy earnings reports and reassuring dividend announcements lie troubling inconsistencies in cash flows, accounting treatments, and rent collection — issues that suggest the REIT’s growth story may be built on precarious foundations.VREIT’s shares have plummeted to ₱1.30 as of October 10, 2025 — down 30.5% in just three months — and its current touted dividend yield of 14.2% is now overshadowed by concerns that the company is paying out more than it earns. VREIT is 64.6% owned by Fine Properties, Inc., the Villar family’s private holding company. Fine Properties also controls Villar Land Holdings (PSE: HVN) and Vista Land & Lifescapes (PSE: VLL), both critical pieces of the Villar real estate ecosystem. The structure creates a circular flow of transactions: VLL leases properties from VREIT, which earns rental income from VLL and other Villar-related tenants, such as AllDay Supermarkets, AllHome, Coffee Project, and AllBank. On paper, this looks like a robust ecosystem. In practice, it blurs the line between genuine third-party revenue and internal transfers that rely on Villar companies paying rent to each other. When the paying entities themselves delay or fail to pay — while still being treated as “current” receivables — VREIT’s financial independence is called into question. In a message sent to Rappler, VREIT says the majority of the company’s receivables pertain to future rental escalations: “These amounts are not yet due and will only be billed upon the application of the relevant escalation rates, in accordance with the terms of our lease agreements. As required under Philippine Accounting Standards (PAS) 17, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which includes future escalation amounts. “This results in a timing difference between revenue recognition and actual cash collection, as a portion of the revenue recognized consists of unbilled rental income tied to future rent increases. Since these are contractually guaranteed and not yet due, no allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against them. “These accounting treatments do not affect the Company’s distributable income or its ability to pay dividends. Items, such as receivables related to future rental escalations, along with fair value gains or losses, are excluded from distributable income calculations. As such, they have no bearing on the dividends declared. “Since 2022, our dividend payouts have followed an upward trend, aligned with our improving financial performance. For full year 2024, we declared and paid dividends representing a 6.77% increase over FY2023, reflecting both our operational strength and prudent financial management.” The statement mirrors the company’s technical accounting disclosure which explains that part of its receivables and revenues are not yet actual cash — a nuance that can easily confuse investors. Let’s unpack it forensically and analytically: In the polished language of corporate disclosure, VREIT is saying that its “majority of receivables pertain to future rental escalations.” The line looks harmless enough — until you realize what it really means: That a sizable portion of its declared income doesn’t yet exist in cash form. Under PAS (Philippine Accounting Standards) 17, rental income must be recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This is a technical way of saying that VREIT records future rent increases as today’s revenue. Yes, it smooths out earnings, but it also makes profits look richer and steadier than the cash that actually enters its coffers. Imagine a tenant paying ₱100,000 a month with a 5% annual escalation for five years. Instead of recording ₱100k in year one and ₱105k in year two, accounting rules tell VREIT to average the entire lease — say, ₱115k monthly across all years. On paper, that looks prudent. In reality, VREIT is booking income it hasn’t billed, much less collected. Those unbilled amounts sit under receivables, which the company assures are contractually guaranteed by Fine Properties, the parent company of Vista Land & Lifescapes, Inc. and Golden MV Holdings, Inc. That guarantee, therefore, is only as strong as the group’s internal cash flow. This accounting quirk creates a widening gap between reported income and actual operating cash. An investor should immediately ask: if VREIT’s income keeps rising, while its cash from operations lags, who’s paying for the difference? When the REIT declares dividends — based on distributable income rather than accrued income — the pressure builds. Unless the tenants catch up in real pesos, VREIT may be paying investors from cash borrowed, not earned. No allowance for doubtful accounts is booked against these unbilled receivables. This is because technically they’re “not yet due.” But that assumption hinges on perfect tenant performance. Should any related tenant falter — say, if AllHome or AllDay stumbles in retail sales — those “future escalations” could be quietly renegotiated or deferred.In short, what looks like a guaranteed receivable could easily become a paper promise. The Villar property universe operates like a closed loop: the landlord (VREIT) leases to the developer (Vista Land) and its affiliates, who, in turn, drive traffic to the malls which VREIT owns. It’s not only a vertically integrated empire, it’s also a circular system of self-guarantee. When a REIT’s income depends on affiliates’ ability to pay, the risk ceases to be about tenants — it becomes about the group’s overall liquidity. At first glance, VREIT’s earnings appear spectacular. After a reported ₱9.6 billion loss in 2022, the company swung to ₱2.5 billion in 2023 and ₱5.0 billion in 2024, maintaining similar levels through mid-2025. To the casual investor, that suggests rapid profitability and operational recovery.However, the company’s own disclosures tell a different story. VREIT’s financials were heavily distorted by large one-off items and asset revaluations, totaling: Once these non-recurring items are stripped away, the core picture becomes far less flattering. VREIT’s cash from operations — the most reliable measure of actual business performance — has barely turned positive: In other words, despite reporting billions in “profits,” the company’s operations generated less than ₱400 million in real cash in the past twelve months — barely a fraction of its declared dividends. VREIT currently boasts a 14.2% dividend yield — one of the highest in the Philippine market. Yet, this headline figure is deeply misleading. The dividends are not covered by either earnings or cash flow: In practical terms, this means that for every peso VREIT earns in cash, it pays out ₱3.64 in dividends. Such payouts are unsustainable, unless funded by debt, asset sales, or fresh capital injections — all of which erode shareholder value over time.This strategy may keep investors complacent in the short term, but it dangerously masks the underlying liquidity shortfall. Beyond accounting optics, the straight-line rental recognition policy ripples through key valuation metrics — quietly altering the way investors perceive performance and stability. 1. NAV (Net Asset Value) Inflation Unbilled rent receivables from future escalations appear under current assets. This inflates total assets and, therefore, artificially boosts NAV per share. However, since these receivables cannot be liquidated or pledged for financing, they function more like deferred gains rather than real wealth. Forensic verdict: NAV overstated by the value of non-cash rent accruals — likely in the hundreds of millions. 2. Dividend Yield Distortion REITs are prized for high dividend yields. But if dividends are funded by accrued — not collected — income, the yield figure becomes mathematically inflated but economically hollow. Investors may think they’re earning 7–8% annually, when in fact, cash-backed yield could be closer to 5–6%. 3. Debt-service coverage risk Because income is front-loaded on paper, financial ratios like interest coverage or debt-service coverage look healthier than they truly are. When cash flow trails far behind accounting income, the margin for debt repayment tightens. In a tightening credit environment, lenders watch this metric closely — and may reprice loans or demand higher collateral. 4. Tenant concentration multiplier Roughly 80% of VREIT’s tenants are Villar-controlled entities. If even one affiliate delays payment, the entire REIT cycle is disrupted. That makes VREIT’s risk systemic within its own ecosystem. It is true that VREIT’s disclosure complies with PAS 17. It’s clean accounting — but aggressive optics. It allows the company to show stable, growing income even if actual collections trail behind. For ordinary investors, the lesson is clear: VREIT presents itself as a stable, high-yield property trust — but its accounting structure reveals earnings inflated by unbilled, non-cash rent accruals recognized under PAS 17. This raises liquidity, valuation, and related-party exposure concerns. Core accounting issue Quantitative indicators (mid-2025 estimates) Forensic red flags VistaREIT’s income is front-loaded, its cash is lagging, and its guarantees are circular. The REIT’s apparent stability is built on accrued future rents — accounting profits that have yet to arrive as cash. In a market hungry for yield, Villar’s VREIT shines as a steady earner on paper. But a forensic read tells another story: one of timing differences, intra-group dependencies, and valuation fantasies that make the REIT’s strength look better than it feels. The REIT counts tomorrow’s rent today. The question is: When the bill finally comes due, will tomorrow pay? – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] Villar’s VREIT: Counting future’s rent today,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-villar-vista-reit-counting-future-rent/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Six Philippine business groups voiced their support towards several efforts to promote transparency and good governance. In a statement on Friday, October 17, the groups backed proposed reforms to the bank secrecy deposit law and the Foreign Currency Deposit Act. The statement was signed by the following groups: The groups described the two laws as “straitjackets” for regulators that prevented them from being more efficient in tasks such as investigating and prosecuting those involved in corruption and money laundering. The groups also believe the laws have severely restricted the Philippines’ country’s financial and economic stability. The proposed amendments to the bank secrecy law allows the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to examine deposits when its Monetary Board finds reason to suspect bank officials and employees or those tied to BSP-supervised financial institutions are involved in fraud. “By empowering regulators and enforcement agencies with the authority to investigate corruption, tax evasion, and other illicit economic activities, the reforms will help ensure integrity across both public and private financial systems,” they wrote. In a blog post by BSP Deputy Governor Mamerto Tangonan, Assistant Governor Maria Margarita Debuque-Gonzales, and Currency Policy and Integrity Head Eloisa Glindro, the officials called for the easing of bank secrecy laws to curb corruption. “Easing bank secrecy — with appropriate safeguards — would empower investigators to trace illicit funds, match deposits to asset declarations, and build prosecutable cases. Unlike demonetization, which imposes broad costs on the public, transparency reform targets corruption at its source,” the officials wrote. The three officials of the monetary authority also described calls to demonetize the P1,000 and P500 bills as a blunt and high-cost instrument against corruption. Their remarks come after former finance secretary Cesar Purisima called for the phaseout of P1,000 and P500 bills amid claims that billions in public funds were delivered to the homes of Leyte 1st District Representative Martin Romualdez and former Ako Bicol representative Zaldy Co. The three BSP officials also called for complementary measures to curb corruption such as the following: Business groups also strongly support Ombudsman Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla’s decision to restore public access to officials’ Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net worth (SALN). The groups believe that lifting the Duterte-era restriction will reinforce the constitutional principle that accountability is key to maintaining citizens’ confidence in their public institutions. They also underscored the importance of good governance in boosting the confidence of local and foreign investors. “When governance systems are predictable and information is accessible, the risks of corruption and policy uncertainty decrease, lowering the cost of doing business. This attracts sustained capital inflows, promotes fair competition, and contributes to stronger, more resilient economic growth,” they said. – Rappler.com",True,true,"PH business groups back bank secrecy reforms, restoring SALN access",https://www.rappler.com/business/business-groups-support-bank-secrecy-reforms-restore-saln-access/,Rappler
"BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – The Baguio City government is preparing to file a court case seeking to compel the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) to turn over the 247-hectare John Hay Special Economic Zone (JHSEZ), citing unpaid revenue shares and the termination of BCDA’s lease with its former private developer. Mayor Benjamin Magalong said the City Legal Office is finalizing the case, which will ask the courts to enforce provisions of Resolution 362, Series of 1994, the ordinance that laid down 19 conditions governing the redevelopment of Camp John Hay. “We are already preparing the case. Our legal officers are coordinating closely to ensure that it is solid before filing,” Magalong said in a recent briefing. City officials said the legal action will be anchored on two developments: (1) BCDA’s alleged failure to fully remit the city’s mandated revenue shares from John Hay operations, and (2) the termination of the lease contract between BCDA and Camp John Hay Development Corporation (CJHDevCo). The lease was effectively terminated after the Supreme Court upheld a 2015 arbitral ruling ordering CJHDevCo to vacate the property, affirming the government’s reclamation of Camp John Hay. According to the city government, the lease termination triggered Conditionality No. 16 of Resolution 362, which provides that once the lease expires, the John Hay property and all improvements “shall be turned over to the City Government of Baguio without compensation.” Baguio Representative Mauricio G. Domogan, a former mayor who helped frame Resolution 362 in the 1990s, has publicly urged the city to invoke Conditionality 16 as the legal basis for turnover. Domogan said the Supreme Court ruling effectively ended BCDA’s authority to continue holding the property under a private lease arrangement and should result in the reversion of the JHSEZ to the city. “The lease has lapsed. The condition is clear: the property and improvements should be turned over to the city,” Domogan said in an earlier interview. He said he has been coordinating with the city’s legal team and supports the filing of the case. The planned suit is part of a broader dispute between the city government and BCDA over compliance with the 19 conditionalities, several of which the city says remain unfulfilled nearly three decades after they were imposed. City officials have said BCDA still owes ₱225 million in unpaid revenue shares under Conditionalities 9 and 10, which entitle Baguio City to a percentage of gross income and lease revenues generated within the JHSEZ. The city says it has sent at least four demand letters since 2023 seeking payment, but has received no commitment from BCDA to settle the outstanding amount. The move to compel turnover comes amid long-standing tensions between the city government and BCDA over control, revenues, and governance of Camp John Hay. Aside from revenue sharing, unresolved issues include the segregation of barangays within the reservation and the city’s role in reviewing redevelopment plans for the estate. City officials have said they want the courts to finally clarify the respective rights and obligations of the local government and BCDA, particularly in light of the Supreme Court ruling and the city’s standing ordinance. As of writing, BCDA has not issued a public statement responding to the city’s plan to seek judicial intervention. The John Hay Management Corporation, BCDA’s estate manager, has also yet to comment. Magalong said the case will be filed once the legal team completes its review, stressing that the city is pursuing the matter through legal channels “to protect Baguio’s rights under the law.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Baguio City readies court case to compel BCDA to turn over Camp John Hay,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/luzon/baguio-city-readies-court-case-compel-bcda-turn-over-camp-john-hay/,Rappler
"When the Philippines’ largest state pension fund — the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) — finds itself in the crosshairs of governance and investment scrutiny, the headlines are dramatic: a purported ₱8.8-billion loss; a call for the resignation of its president, Jose Arnulfo “Wick” Veloso, and a war of numbers between dissenting trustees and management. Vantage Point combed through GSIS financials, did forensic pencil-pushing and found out a more complex narrative: strong growth, a sizable asset base, and questions over transparency rather than pure performance. This column examines the numbers, the governance issues, and what they mean for the fund’s long-term health. For the year 2024, GSIS reported net income from operations of ₱135.7 billion, up 21% from ₱112.1 billion in 2023. Total income for 2024 was ₱326.86 billion (↑10.29% year-on-year). Total assets at end-2024 were reported at ₱1.83 trillion, up ~9.23% from the prior year. Gross premiums written in its insurance business in 2024 reached ₱10.6 billion (target was ₱8.5 billion). Administrative expenses in 2024 fell to ₱8.92 billion (from ₱10.14 billion), improving the administrative cost ratio from ~3.7% to ~3.0%. Loans to GSIS members grew to ₱370.65 billion in 2024; collection efficiency as of the third quarter (Q3) was 98.6%. Investment gains for the year included: ₱13.27 billion from foreign exchange, ₱11.24 billion from global private equity (via external fund managers), and ₱3.09 billion from local equity investments. The investment portfolio strategy: around 70% in government securities and fixed income, and around 30% in higher-yielding investments, such as equities, real-estate, etc. — all within risk parameters. From these numbers, GSIS appears to be performing strongly at a high level: growing assets, rising income, improved cost-efficiency. The increase in net income and relatively modest administrative cost suggest operational discipline. Its investment strategy is somewhat conservative (70% fixed income and government securities) with a tilt (30%) toward higher yield assets. That may help balance stability vs growth. The membership lending business is growing (₱370 billion loans) and collection efficiency is high (98.6%), which supports the health of that asset base. The insurance business component seems to be doing better than target (gross premiums ₱10.6 billion vs target ₱8.5 billion) which is a promising sign for diversification. However, the net worth of ₱62 billion seems relatively small given the asset base (~₱1.8 trillion). That could raise questions about leverage, reserves, solvency or actuarial liabilities (though I don’t have all the details here). The membership base: according to icrs.gcg.gov.ph, as of March 2025, GSIS had 2,736,710 members and pensioners (2.1 million active members and ~636,000 pensioners). This gives context to the scale of liabilities they carry. While GSIS has expanded its asset base, the net worth — its true equity buffer — stands at only ₱62 billion. When you subtract that from total assets, you arrive at ₱1.768 trillion in liabilities, much of it representing long-term pension and insurance obligations. That figure translates into a debt-to-equity ratio of roughly 28.5 to 1 — meaning that for every peso in equity, GSIS shoulders almost ₱29 pesos in obligations. In the corporate world, that kind of leverage would be alarming. For a pension fund, it’s not automatically a red flag, but it does demand scrutiny. Unlike private firms that can raise equity or restructure debt, GSIS’s “debt” largely consists of actuarial commitments to its members: retirement benefits, life insurance, survivorship claims. These are promises that stretch decades into the future. The fund’s long-term health depends not only on its profits today, but on whether its assets are structured to meet those future claims — what actuaries call asset-liability matching. In October 2025, a group of GSIS trustees and insiders called for the resignation of President and General Manager Jose Arnulfo “Wick” Veloso. They claimed GSIS incurred ₱8.8 billion in losses, attributed to speculative or poorly approved investments and governance lapses (e.g. splitting transactions to avoid board thresholds). But, upon scrutiny, Vantage Point discovered that: Thus: the allegation may raise valid governance and investment risk concerns, but in purely financial terms, it does not yet rise to the level of proving a collapse or systemic meltdown of the fund. Nickel Asia: The only fully-documented paper loss Of the five companies cited — Monde Nissin, Nickel Asia, Bloomberry Resorts, DigiPlus Interactive, and Alternergy Holdings — only the Nickel Asia investment has a clearly documented entry price. In April 2023, GSIS bought 233.6 million shares at ₱6.25 each, for a total of ₱1.46 billion. With Nickel Asia trading at around ₱3.95 today, the paper loss stands at ₱537 million, or 36.8% of the exposure. Still, Nickel Asia has been paying steady dividends. GSIS has likely collected around ₱84 million in cash distributions since 2023, cushioning part of the decline. The stock’s weakness stems mainly from softer global nickel prices, not mismanagement. It is, in investment terms, a “mark-to-market” paper loss — unrealized and reversible. DigiPlus: The outlier winner Where the GSIS has clearly done well is in DigiPlus Interactive Corp., the former Leisure and Resorts World. GSIS invested about ₱1 billion in early 2024, when the stock hovered around ₱10 to ₱12. With the share now trading at ₱22.85, the fund sits on a near-100 percent gain — a potential paper profit of ₱1 billion. In September 2025, the pension fund itself disclosed ₱139 million in realized earnings from this single position. The company’s gaming and digital entertainment turnaround has rewarded early believers, and GSIS’ entry now looks like a prescient bet rather than a reckless plunge. Alternergy: Still under COA’s probe In November 2023, it subscribed to ₱1.45 billion worth of perpetual preferred shares (PPS2-A) — structured to pay 8-10% yearly income, plus an eventual redemption premium that could deliver a total return of roughly 56%, or ₱826 million, over the instrument’s life. We pointed out in a recent column that its market capitalization was way below the minimum required under GSIS investment rules. Alternergy was also heavily leveraged (i.e. high debt relative to equity) and had weak interest coverage, which made it financially risky. We also reported that the shares (preferred shares) purchased by the GSIS were not listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) at the time the agreement and payment were made. Since GSIS rules require investments in listed companies (or at least properly listed securities) for such equity exposures, this non-listing is a violation. The COA, however, still has to wrap up its investigation on these issues. Some analysts point out however, that questions on Alternergy were procedural — focused on documentation and risk classification — not a finding of actual loss. GSIS investment in it is not equivalent to a crashing stock. They say it’s an income asset, not a speculative play. Monde Nissin and Bloomberry: The unverified estimates The two other names, Monde Nissin and Bloomberry Resorts, are where rumor overtakes record. No formal GSIS disclosures exist showing how much or when these positions were acquired. If GSIS bought Monde in mid-2024 at ₱9-₱11, its current ₱7.05 price implies a 20-35% paper loss. Similarly, if it took Bloomberry at ₱7-₱8, the current ₱3.69 level would mean a 50-plus decline. But those remain hypothetical, absent filings or trade records. Market swings do not automatically equate to bad management. Pension funds are long-term investors; they ride cycles, not headlines. The bigger picture: Context matters Is the ₱8.8-billion loss being brandished by critics already realized and catastrophic? The pension fund’s total assets exceed ₱1.6 trillion. Even a full ₱0.5 billion paper loss from Nickel Asia equals just 0.03% of its portfolio — hardly the collapse suggested. Moreover, the combination of DigiPlus’ gains and Alternergy’s fixed-income return likely offsets most of the temporary drawdowns elsewhere. Mark-to-market losses only materialize when an asset is sold below cost. Until then, they are accounting snapshots, not evidence of plunder. Politics vs. performance Still, GSIS must not hide behind technicalities. Transparency is essential when handling workers’ pensions. Every peso invested should be disclosed with cost basis, rationale, and expected yield. The current uproar, in truth, springs as much from opacity as from losses. Veloso’s management should release an audited investment performance report, itemizing realized versus unrealized results. That would silence the rumor mill and allow the public to judge based on arithmetic, not accusation. A forensic verdict The forensic trail shows one confirmed paper loss (Nickel Asia), one clear profit (DigiPlus), and one future income-bearing preferred deal (Alternergy) — not a pattern of reckless gambling, but a diversified portfolio under market conditions. Monde and Bloomberry remain speculative entries without proof. In short: the “₱8.8-billion loss” collapses under forensic scrutiny. If one digs beneath the numbers, the most pressing concern is governance, not just performance. Three core threads emerge: Approval thresholds and transaction splitting: The allegation states that some investments were deliberately “split” into tranches so they stayed below board-approval limits, thereby potentially circumventing required oversight. If true, this is a process violation rather than a bad investment per se. COA is still probing this. Investment allocation and “risk buckets”: GSIS states about 70% of its portfolio is in fixed-income/government securities (in 2024) and the remainder in higher-yield/higher-risk assets (equities, real estate). But the June 2025 note that 72% is in “relatively risk-free” assets suggests some consistency. If speculative investments are hidden within the “higher-risk” bucket and not transparently disclosed, then the oversight weakness lies in classification, transparency and potential concentration risk. Transparency and disclosure: The absence of published breakdowns of realized vs unrealized gains/losses by investment, seen-by-seen board-approval documentation, and external forensic review means stakeholders and pensioners have less visibility than might be ideal for a fund of this size. The call for Veloso’s resignation highlights that some internal trustees have lost confidence — more likely not because of a single loss figure, but because of process and trust. In short: performance is strong; the worry is less about whether investments lost money, but more about how decisions were made and if governance safeguards were adhered to. 1. Realized vs. unrealized losses: Are losses locked in or just paper marks? Unrealized = value has dropped, but you haven’t “cashed it out” yet.Realized = the drop has been locked in by a transaction. Let us say that GSIS bought a bond for ₱1,000,000: If at the end of the year the fair market value is ₱900,000 and they haven’t sold it — there’s an unrealized loss of ₱100,000. If in a subsequent period GSIS decides to sell the bond for ₱880,000 — then the loss of ₱120,000 (₱1,000,000 cost minus ₱880,000 sale) becomes a realized loss once the sale happens. 2. Concentration risk: Are certain holdings dominating the “high-risk” bucket without disclosure? 3. Board documentation: Are approvals properly recorded, limits adhered to, and committees functionally empowered? 4. External audits/forensic reviews: Will the COA or Senate report provide line-by-line clarity? GSIS today stands as a financially robust institution — with strong asset growth, healthy net income and a long actuarial horizon. Yet the drama around a possible ₱8.8-billion loss could be a governance alarm bell. For stakeholders, the path forward is clear: GSIS must go beyond affirming strong results. It must demonstrate that each investment, each approval, and each risk were subject to rigorous, documented oversight. Until that happens, the fund’s strong performance may be overshadowed by the question of whether it’s managed with the discipline and transparency its beneficiaries deserve. GSIS president Wick Veloso in a Viber message to Vantage Point says that under his watch, the pension fund has complied with all these. – Rappler.com",True,true,"[Vantage Point] GSIS at a crossroads: Strength in numbers yes, but strain in governance?",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-gsis-crossroads-strength-numbers-strain-governance/,Rappler
"Paramount Skydance on Monday launched a hostile bid worth $108.4 billion for Warner Bros Discovery, in a last-ditch effort to outbid Netflix and create a media powerhouse that would challenge the dominance of the streaming giant. Netflix had emerged victorious on Friday from a weeks-long bidding war with Paramount and Comcast, securing a $72 billion equity deal for Warner Bros Discovery’s TV, film studios and streaming assets. But Paramount’s latest attempt means the jockeying for Warner Bros and its prized HBO and DC Comics assets will not come to a conclusion swiftly. The Warner Bros Discovery board of directors on Monday afternoon said it would review Paramount’s offer, but was not modifying its recommendation with respect to Netflix. It advised the company to “take no action at this time” in regard to the Paramount Skydance proposal. Paramount’s $30-per-share cash offer includes financing from Affinity Partners, the investment firm run by Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, and several Middle Eastern government-run investment funds, and is backstopped by the Ellison family. Larry Ellison, the world’s second-richest person, is the father of Paramount head David Ellison and has close ties to the White House. The studio argues its bid for the entirety of Warner Bros Discovery is superior to Netflix, giving shareholders $18 billion more in cash and an easier path to regulatory approval. It said a Paramount-Warner Bros combination, which would be among the largest media deals in history, would be in the best interest of the creative community, movie theaters and consumers, who would benefit from enhanced competition. “We believe our offer will create a stronger Hollywood,” Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement. Separately, he said Paramount’s proposal offered “higher headline value, increased certainty in that value, greater regulatory certainty, and a pro-Hollywood, pro-consumer and pro-competition future.” Paramount’s bid includes Warner Bros Discovery’s cable television properties; Netflix’s bid is limited to the Warner Bros film and television studios, HBO and the HBO Max streaming service. Analysts noted that Paramount’s offer comes with its own antitrust scrutiny as a consolidation of two major television operators. Last month, Democratic senators warned that such a transaction would result in “one company controlling almost everything Americans watch on TV.” The combined studio would also have a greater market share than current leader Disney, and add to fears of consolidation that have hit the industry in recent years. The offer represents a 139% premium over the company’s value from before the buyout talks started, and bests Netflix’s $27.75 offer that mixes cash and stock. At a UBS conference, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said Paramount’s hostile bid for Warner Bros was “entirely expected,” but added that he was confident of closing the deal. “In the offer that Paramount was talking about today, the Ellisons were talking about $6 billion of synergies,” said Sarandos. “Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs? So we’re not cutting jobs. We’re making jobs.” In a regulatory filing, Paramount said that the Ellison family, which owns Paramount, along with private equity firm RedBird Capital, had agreed to backstop $40.7 billion in equity capital. The offer also includes financing from Kushner’s Affinity Partners, the Saudi and Qatari sovereign wealth funds, and L’imad Holding Co, owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. “A Paramount Skydance-Warner Bros merger would be a five-alarm antitrust fire and exactly what our anti-monopoly laws are written to prevent,” US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, said on Monday. The hostile bid “is backed by a who’s who of Trump buddies … raising serious questions about influence-peddling, political favoritism, and national security risks.” If Warner Bros accepts Paramount’s offer, it will have to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion breakup fee. Netflix, on its part, is on the hook for $5.8 billion if its deal falls through. The streaming pioneer is likely to face strong antitrust scrutiny, and Trump has already raised questions about its offer. On Monday, Trump said neither bidding party “are friends of mine,” and he wanted “to do what’s right.” He added that he had not spoken to Kushner about the Paramount bid. Netflix’s bid has already drawn sharp criticism from bipartisan lawmakers and Hollywood unions over concerns that it could lead to job cuts as well as higher prices for consumers. “While it is perhaps a sad commentary on the US that Paramount thinks its closeness to the occupant of the Oval Office will help it seal the deal, it is merely doing what it can to steal a march on its rival,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at UK-based IG Group. Shares of Paramount were up 7.3% on Monday. Warner Bros Discovery rose 5.3%, while Netflix shares fell 4%. Reuters had already reported, citing sources familiar, that Paramount had raised its offer to $30 per share on Thursday for the entire company, but that the Warner Bros board had concerns about the financing. “The Warner Bros Discovery acquisition is far from over,” said eMarketer senior analyst Ross Benes. “Paramount will appeal to shareholders, regulators, and politicians to try to stymie Netflix. The battle could become prolonged.” Paramount maintained that it would be a champion of Hollywood and its talent, would remain committed to releasing movies in theaters, and that its path to regulatory approval would be faster than Netflix’s. In its appeal to shareholders, Paramount said it submitted six proposals over the course of 12 weeks, but Warner Bros “never engaged meaningfully” with these proposals. The company said it had sent a letter to Warner Bros, questioning the sale process and alleging the company has abandoned a fair bidding process and predetermined Netflix as the winner. That followed reports that Warner Bros’ management called the Netflix deal a “slam dunk” while speaking negatively about Paramount’s offer. In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Paramount CEO David Ellison said there was an “inherent bias” in the bidding. – Rappler.com",True,true,Warner Bros fight heats up with $108 billion hostile bid from Paramount,https://www.rappler.com/business/paramount-bid-acquisition-warner-bros/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Lopez-led ABS-CBN Corporation has settled its financial dispute with Manny V. Pangilinan’s (MVP) TV5 and Mediaquest and signed a licensing deal with Manny Villar’s ALLTV. In a disclosure late Wednesday, December 17, the former broadcast giant said it has acceded to TV5’s notice terminating its content agreement effective January 2, 2026. The content deal allowed TV5 to air ABS-CBN shows on the Kapatid channel’s prime time slots on weekdays and on weekends with the two platforms sharing ad revenues. ABS-CBN also said that it has “formally tendered payments” to the MVP Group that settles a reported nearly P1 billion in delayed payments of TV5’s revenue share from the content deal. The Kapatid Channel earlier said the delay “had affected TV5’s ability to settle its own obligations.” ABS-CBN, which is heavily indebted, had disputed the reported P950 million delayed payments to TV5 as of October 2025, although it did not provide details on what it was contesting. In the same disclosure, ABS-CBN said it has signed a licensing agreement with Villar’s Advanced Media Broadcasting System (AMBS), owner and operator of ALLTV Network, on the airing of ABS-CBN’s Kapamilya Channel on ALLTV starting January 2. “Starting on this date, ALLTV audiences will be able to watch their favorite ABS-CBN shows like FPJ’s Batang Quiapo, Roja, What Lies Beneath, It’s Showtime, ASAP, TV Patrol, and more. Prime ABS-CBN programs will continue to be available on A2Z, with It’s Showtime and Pinoy Big Brother Celebrity Collab 2.0 airing on GMA,” ABS-CBN said. ALLTV operates ABS-CBN’s former free TV Channel 2 (analog) in Mega Manila, which the Lopezes lost after the Rodrigo Duterte administration rejected the broadcast renewal in 2020. Then-congresswoman and now Senator Camille Villar was among those who voted against a new franchise for ABS-CBN. ABS-CBN signed a content deal with AMBS in 2024 on the airing of old content under their Jeepney TV brand plus the noon show It’s Showtime and its primetime news show TV Patrol. In a press statement on Wednesday, ABS-CBN thanked Pangilinan and TV5 “for providing a home for some ABS-CBN programs since 2021.” On Thursday, December 18, ABS-CBN told the Philippine Stock Exchange that the two “transactions have no significant impact on ABS-CBN’s operations.” – Rappler.com",True,true,"ABS-CBN settles money dispute with TV5, signs deal with Villar’s ALLTV",https://www.rappler.com/business/abs-cbn-settles-financial-dispute-tv5-signs-deal-manny-villar-alltv/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Water concessionaire Maynilad made its stock market debut on Friday, November 7, in the largest public offering since food and beverage firm Monde Nissin in 2021. The water concessionaire chaired by tycoon Manny Pangilinan is now listed at the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) under the ticker symbol “MYNLD” and made its initial public offering (IPO) of 1.6 billion primary common shares priced at P15 apiece. Around 24.9 million million shares were also allocated to First Pacific Company Limited to maintain its current shareholding. The offer was 2.7 times oversubscribed, which happens when demand for a stock is greater than the number of available shares. The IPO also attracted 12 cornerstone investors such as the Asian Development Bank, the International Finance Corporation, and the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Cornerstone investors are large, reputable institutional investors that purchase a predetermined amount of shares in an IPO before the public launch. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who led the bell-ringing ceremony for Maynilad’s public debut, hopes that Maynilad’s entry into the stock market will draw more investments into the local market. “Maynilad’s public listing signals what I have been telling the world: that the Philippines is open, ready, and eager to do business with you,” he said. Pangilinan said that the listing is more than just a fulfillment of provisions in Maynilad’s legislative franchise, but a commitment to efficiently deliver the essential services it offers. “This listing is not just about franchise compliance, nor is it just about capital raising. It is, above all, a commitment to continue delivering essential services, with integrity and excellence,” he said. Under Maynilad’s legislative franchise, the water concessionaire is required to go public by January 2027. (READ: Maynilad, Manila Water concession deals get 10-year extension) Maynilad’s president and chief executive officer Ramoncito Fernandez said the company will use the proceeds from the IPO to fund its capital expenditure (capex) requirements. “We have a very aggressive capex plan that has been approved by the regulators… So that will definitely help us in making our services improve via this capex plan,” Fernandez told reporters in a Friday briefing. Fernandez said low-hanging fruits for the company include offering wastewater and sanitation services to its commercial and industrial customers, as well as expanding its services to areas beyond its concession zone. In particular, Fernandez said Maynilad is looking to offer its services to local government units (LGUs) adjacent to the areas it currently serves. Maynilad serves around 95% of the 11 million population in the west zone of Greater Manila Area: City of Manila (certain portions), Quezon City (certain portions), Makati (west of South Super Highway), Caloocan, Pasay, Parañaque, Las Piñas, Muntinlupa, Valenzuela, Navotas and Malabon, all in Metro Manila; the cities of Cavite, Bacoor and Imus, and the municipalities of Kawit, Noveleta and Rosario, all in Cavite province. “There are still, specifically, the adjacent cities beside our borders, our boundaries, [want] our services. So that’s a possibility for us that we can offer to these LGUs that are wanting improved services, both in the boundaries in Bulacan and the boundaries in Cavite,” he explained. Maynilad closed its first trading day slightly lower at P14.98 per share. The PSE benchmark index retreated to the 5,700 level on Friday trade amid lower than expected economic growth data in the third quarter. – Rappler.com",True,true,Maynilad raises P34.3 billion from stock market debut,https://www.rappler.com/business/maynilad-ipo-stock-market-debut-november-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The team of upcoming romantic comedy film The Last Resort, which stars Daisy Ridley and Alden Ehrenreich and is being shot in the Philippines, paid a courtesy call on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in Malacañang on Wednesday, May 21. Ridley and Ehrenreich — known worldwide as Star Wars heroes Rey Skywalker and the young version of Han Solo, respectively — are set to lead a prominently Filipino cast for their latest project, shot in the Philippines and directed by Donald Petrie, the man behind hit films Miss Congeniality, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, and Grumpy Old Men. According to a Variety report, The Last Resort is about a hotel executive who goes to the Philippines to look for a resort location, and along the way meets an expatriate charter pilot. Joining the pair in the cast are a who’s who of Philippine entertainment, like Tonton Gutierrez, Mylene Dizon, Tetchie Agbayani, and Fil-Am stand-up comedian Jo Koy. Marcos praised the film upon being shown a few minutes of finished scenes by The Last Resort production team, saying they “hit all the high spots.” “It’s all terribly exciting for all of us,” he said. “Thank you for coming to the Philippines, hopefully helping us project the Philippines to the world the way Filipinos see our own country.” The President added that the Philippines is a “natural film location,” referencing the 1979 Francis Ford Coppola hit war film Apocalypse Now, which filmed several scenes in the country. Other major Hollywood films that also featured the Philippines are The Bourne Legacy and Avengers: Infinity War. Filipino business magnate Manny V. Pangilinan, and producers Ernesto “Bong“ Sta. Maria Jr. and Raja Collins joined Petrie and the rest of the cast in the courtesy call. Ecstatic in meeting Ridley and Ehrenreich, Marcos is also in all likelihood a Star Wars fan, having once cosplayed as a Jedi Knight to celebrate “Star Wars Day” or “May the Fourth.” – Rappler.com",True,true,"‘The Last Resort’ stars Daisy Ridley, Alden Ehrenreich, team pay call on Marcos",https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/daisy-ridley-alden-ehrenreich-the-last-resort-malacanang-call-marcos/,Rappler
"Amazon said on Tuesday, October 28, it will reduce its global corporate workforce by about 14,000 people, with more cuts expected next year, in a major shakeup driven in part by adoption of artificial intelligence at the tech giant. The online retailer began laying off employees across multiple divisions as part of a plan, first reported on Monday by Reuters, to cut as many as 30,000 employees. The company has not confirmed the broader layoff plan, but in a companywide email indicated further cuts were planned. Amazon is working to compensate for over-hiring during the peak demand of the pandemic and to limit costs as it enters its crucial holiday selling season. The layoffs offer an early look at the possibly broad effects of AI on workforces. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy flagged the potential for such losses in June, saying increased use of AI tools and agents would lead to more corporate job cuts, particularly through automating routine tasks. Amazon had about 1.56 million full-time and part-time employees at the end of last year. Its corporate workforce includes roughly 350,000 employees. Workers told Reuters they learned their jobs were eliminated from letters sent to their personal email addresses early on Tuesday morning. “You are no longer required to perform work on Amazon’s behalf,” reads the email from Beth Galetti, senior vice president of People Experience and Technology, which was sent to impacted employees and seen by Reuters. She said those workers would be given the option to meet with a human resources employee via video call. “Unfortunately, your role is being eliminated and your employment will end after a non-working period.” Amazon will offer most affected workers 90 days to look for a new role internally and said its recruiting teams would prioritize those candidates. Jassy is undertaking an initiative to reduce what he has described as a surfeit of bureaucracy, including by reducing the number of managers. He spun up an anonymous complaint line for identifying inefficiencies that has elicited some 1,500 responses and over 450 process changes. This week’s move represents the deepest job cuts since 27,000 jobs were eliminated in late 2022 and early 2023. Departments affected on Tuesday include devices, advertising, Prime Video, HR, operations, Alexa and Amazon’s cloud computing unit Amazon Web Services (AWS), employees told Reuters. The full scope of departments affected could not be learned and when contacted for clarification, Amazon redirected Reuters to the post on its website. It was not immediately clear over what period the full extent of job cuts will take place, but Galetti said in the note that Amazon would continue hiring in certain areas and reducing headcount in other divisions heading into 2026. Over the past two years, the company has been carrying out piecemeal job cuts across divisions including books, devices and its Wondery podcast business. The layoffs so far have already helped teams move faster, Galetti said. Shares of the Seattle-based company were up 0.8% at midday on Tuesday. The stock has risen about 3.5% this year, making it the worst performer among the “Magnificent 7” group of megacap tech stocks. Galetti’s note reiterated CEO Jassy’s push to reduce management layers and lean more on AI. Corporations are increasingly using the technology to write code for their software and adopting AI agents to automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Galetti said. Amazon is expected to shell out roughly $118 billion in capital expenditures for the year, with much of it going toward building AI and cloud infrastructure. The company will report third-quarter earnings on Thursday. Separately, US Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday called on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to account for what he said were hundreds of thousands of potential lost jobs due to automation. Sanders was referring to a New York Times article published earlier this month that reported Amazon executives believe 500,000 jobs could be cut over time by replacing warehouse workers with robots. Two US senators have also asked Amazon to explain why it is the nation’s largest employer of foreign workers using H-1B visas while also cutting jobs. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Amazon to cut about 14,000 corporate jobs in AI push",https://www.rappler.com/technology/amazon-cuts-corporate-jobs-ai-push-october-28-2025/,Rappler
"Asian airlines scrambled on Saturday, November 29, to fix a software glitch on their Airbus A320 jets as a sweeping recall by the European planemaker grounded aircraft across the region after disrupting travel in the US during the busiest weekend of the year. The recall of 6,000 planes covers more than half of Airbus’ global A320 family fleet, the backbone of Asian short-haul aviation, particularly in China and India where economic growth has brought millions of new travelers into the skies. Regulators around the world followed the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in directing their carriers to remedy the A320 software problem before resuming flights. The Airbus recall, issued to 350 operators around the world, appears to be one of the biggest in its 55-year history and comes weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered model. The US Federal Aviation Administration told carriers to replace or modify software that controls the elevators and ailerons on A319, A320 and A321 airplanes. India’s aviation regulator said 338 Airbus aircraft in the country were affected by the glitch but said the software reset will be completed by Sunday, November 30. The country’s largest airline, IndiGo, has completed the software reset on 143 out of 200 aircraft, the regulator said. Air India, which has 113 impacted aircraft, has completed the reset on 42 aircraft. Both airlines warned of delays on Saturday. “There isn’t any major impact on schedule integrity across our network,” Air India posted on X. “However, some of our flights may be slightly delayed or rescheduled.” Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration instructed airlines to conduct inspections and maintenance. It estimates that around two-thirds of the 67 A320 and A321 aircraft operated by the island’s carriers are affected. The Civil Aviation Authority of Macao said it had asked Air Macau to address the issue, including rescheduling flights to minimize any disruption to passengers. ANA Holdings, Japan’s biggest airline, cancelled 65 flights on Saturday and warned of more disruption on Sunday. ANA and its affiliates, such as Peach Aviation, operate the most Airbus A320 jets in Japan. Its chief rival, Japan Airlines, has a mostly Boeing fleet and does not fly the A320. Nationwide, 95 flights were cancelled, according to public broadcaster NHK. Globally, there are about 11,300 of the single-aisle jets in service, including 6,440 of the core A320. The fix mainly involves reverting to earlier software, and although relatively simple, it must be completed before the planes can fly again. Jetstar, the budget carrier of Australia’s flag carrier Qantas, said some of its flights would be affected by the recall. The Australian Broadcasting Corp reported significant delays at Melbourne airport. South Korea’s Asiana Airlines said it does not expect any significant disruptions to its flight schedule, with only 17 of its aircraft affected by the recall. Its domestic rival, Korean Air, said it was working to get 10 of its jets back into service. South Korea’s Transport Ministry said upgrades to 42 aircraft there were expected to be completed by Sunday morning. Hong Kong budget carrier HK Express said it had upgraded more than half its affected aircraft and that flight operations were normal. The world’s largest A320 operator, American Airlines, said 340 of its 480 A320 aircraft needed the fix, most of which it expected to complete by Saturday. US carriers American, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, and United Airlines are among the world’s 10 biggest A320-family operators. Other airlines that said they would do the repairs include Germany’s Lufthansa, and Britain-based easyJet. Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70% of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8. Industry sources said a sharp loss of altitude on a JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on October 30, that injured several passengers had triggered the Airbus recall. – Rappler.com",True,true,Airbus A320 recall disrupts Asian travel as carriers scramble to patch software,https://www.rappler.com/business/airbus-issues-major-a320-recall-november-28-2025/,Rappler
"NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – Two consumers watchdogs in Bacolod City expressed disappointment with retail magnate Lucio Co’s takeover of the troubled Villar-led PrimeWater Infrastructure Corporation (PrimeWater). Groups Amlig Tubig and Water Watch Advocates (WWA) branded the acquisition as “injustice” to over 70,000 households or water consumers in Bacolod. Co’s Crystal Bridges Holding, Inc. assumed PrimeWater’s role in the controversial 25-year joint venture agreement (JVA) with Bacolod City Water District (BACIWA) that started in November 2020. Bacolod Councilor Wilson “Jun” Gamboa Jr., who is also a convener of Amlig Tubig, believes that despite the takeover, water consumers will still remain in drawback status. The group also calls for the junking of the 2020 JVA. “The JVA is onerous in favor only of PrimeWater, thus, disadvantageous to both BACIWA and the consumers. So, if Co’s Crystal Bridges takes over with the same form of JVA without consulting first the consumers, then, nothing good will happen,” Gamboa said. “It’s illegal ab initio (void from the beginning) simply because it didn’t pass through public consultations,” he added. Gamboa is confident that BACIWA alone can still afford to handle both the management and technicalities of water distribution in Bacolod without PrimeWater or Co’s Crystal Bridges. As to another JVA with Co’s Crystal Bridges, Gamboa said it “should not be labeled as priority.” “For now, just bring back the BACIWA to the people of Bacolod — that’s all ,” he added. WWA convener Wennie Sancho said since the takeover was done in haste without the knowledge of BACIWA executives and Bacolod consumers, then “something [seems suspicious].” Sancho dared BACIWA leaders led by Sonya Verdeflor to hold a dialogue with the consumers and lay down “the truth and nothing but the truth” about the JVA’s status. He also demanded an immediate audit of the financial status of BACIWA. “We want to know the details vis-a-vis what will happen now with the water distribution in Bacolod. WWA cannot afford to see Bacolod water consumers to be [in] limbo,” he said. Meanwhile, Bacolod Lone District Representative Albee Benitez said in a press conference on Thursday, December 18, that Co is set to shell out a P3-billion capital in Bacolod to improve water distribution operations. Benitez also said that the Co group is willing to review the JVA. Benitez also debunked claims that he is one of the incorporators behind Crystal Bridges. Co is now a majority owner of the Bacolod Real Estate Development Corporation port, a business empire founded by Benitez’s grandfather, the late Simplicio Palanca. – Rappler.com",True,true,Lucio Co’s takeover of PrimeWater ‘injustice’ for Bacolod consumers – watchdogs,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/visayas/lucio-co-takeover-primewater-injustice-bacolod-consumers/,Rappler
"As the Philippines enters the new year, it carries two heavy but inseparable ledgers: one economic and one political. Both were written painstakingly over the past 12 months, line by line, decision by decision — sometimes with discipline, often with hesitation, and occasionally with costly contradiction. For investors, citizens, and policymakers alike, the question is no longer whether the country has momentum because it does. The more urgent question is whether it has coherence. Year 2025 was not a collapse year, but it was also not the breakout year many had hoped for. Economic growth remained respectable by regional standards, yet stubbornly below the country’s full potential. Inflation, while easing from its post-pandemic and commodity-shock peaks, left scars on household balance sheets. Interest rates stayed elevated long enough to cool credit appetite and test highly-leveraged corporate structures. The peso found moments of stability, but never fully escaped the gravitational pull of global dollar strength and persistent trade gaps. Still, resilience was unmistakable. Consumption — long the Philippine economy’s most reliable engine — proved difficult to kill, even as food prices pinched and borrowing costs rose. Remittances continued to act as a quiet stabilizer, cushioning external shocks and propping up domestic demand. Infrastructure spending, though unevenly executed, kept the long-term growth narrative intact, reminding markets that concrete, steel, and logistics still matter in a country of more than 110 million people. Yet beneath the headline numbers lay a more uncomfortable truth: growth increasingly felt defended rather than accelerated. Too much of the year was spent managing rather than decisively neutralizing risks that were already visible: supply-side inflation, governance concerns, and regulatory uncertainty, to name a few. Economic policy often sounded right, but moved cautiously. Markets listened, but waited. Politically, the year was defined by an uneasy calm. The administration projected stability, continuity, and pragmatism — qualities investors generally welcome. But stability without urgency carries its own cost. Governance reforms advanced in rhetoric more than in execution. Anti-corruption drives surfaced in waves — sometimes forceful, sometimes selective, often reactive. The result was a political environment that avoided chaos, but fell short of conviction. This ambiguity mattered. Capital is patient only to a point. Foreign investors, already skittish about emerging markets amid global tightening cycles, looked for clearer signals: faster regulatory decisions, stronger institutional accountability, and a sharper break from legacy practices that blur the line between political power and economic privilege. Too often, those signals arrived late or not at all. What the past year ultimately revealed is that the Philippine story is no longer about raw potential. That debate has been settled for decades. It is now about execution risk. Investors are not asking whether the country can grow at 6% or 7% again. They are asking whether the institutions governing that growth are strong enough to make it durable, inclusive, and credible. As the new year opens, the economic outlook offers both relief and challenge. Inflation is easing, giving the Central Bank room to maneuver. Rate cuts, once hypothetical, are now plausible. This could revive credit, lift investment sentiment, and offer breathing space to overextended balance sheets — from households to conglomerates. But easier money will only magnify existing structures. If capital flows into productive investment, the payoff could be substantial. If it merely reflates asset prices or masks inefficiencies, the opportunity will be squandered. Fiscal policy faces a similar fork in the road. Debt levels remain manageable, but no longer trivial. Every peso spent now carries a higher burden of justification. Infrastructure must deliver returns, not just ribbon-cuttings. Social spending must translate into measurable outcomes, not permanent dependency. The margin for populist miscalculation has narrowed. Politically, the coming year will test whether stability can evolve into reform. Midterm dynamics are already shaping incentives. History suggests this is when difficult decisions are postponed, compromises multiply, and accountability thins. But history is not destiny. A credible push on governance — real transparency in public-private partnerships, consistent enforcement of market rules, and visible consequences for abuse — could fundamentally reset investor perception. The Philippines today sits at a familiar crossroads, but with less room for error than in past cycles. Demographics remain favorable, the consumer base is large, and strategic geography still matters in a fragmenting global economy. These are strengths many countries envy. Yet they no longer guarantee patience from markets or forgiveness from citizens. The past year was a reminder that resilience is not the same as progress. The year ahead will determine whether the country merely absorbs shocks — or finally converts stability into sustained, higher-quality growth. For the Philippines, the choice is clear, even if the path is not: reform decisively and earn a re-rating, or drift cautiously and accept mediocrity dressed as resilience. As we step into a new year, the country carries an economic ledger much larger — and more complex — than the simple growth figures that once defined its narrative. Investors, policymakers and global partners are asking the same question: Is the economy ready to transcend cyclical resilience and embrace transformative expansion? The answer today, as culled by Vantage Point, in fresh data from international institutions and local authorities, is a qualified “yes” — but with caveats that aren’t going away. Economically, the Philippines remains one of Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing markets, yet growth is decelerating from the heady post-pandemic rebound. Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 5.5% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025, outpacing many regional peers. Yet, as the year progressed, momentum softened. Multiple forecasts — from regional bodies to local authorities and private economists — now place full-year GDP growth closer to 5.2-5.3%. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank paint similar pictures: growth remains above 5% and competitive globally, but below earlier targets and pre-pandemic trajectories. Notably, the Department of Finance (DOF) itself has acknowledged that 2025 growth may settle nearer to 4.7-4.8%, well under the official 5.5-6.5% goal. Meanwhile, gross national product (GNP) — which includes net income from abroad — has climbed to historic highs in absolute terms, touching over ₱6.68 trillion in the third quarter of 2025. This suggests that income earned by Filipinos overseas and returns from foreign investment remain structural strengths. Inflation presents a nuanced victory. Consumer price inflation slipped to around 1.5% in late 2025, comfortably below the Central Bank’s 2-4% target range.This benign price environment has afforded the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) the flexibility to cut policy rates repeatedly to spur credit and investment — a notable shift from the tight monetary stances of the pandemic era. But low inflation also reflects weaker demand in investment and external sectors, not simply price stability. That’s the precise challenge facing Philippine policymakers: avoid deflationary complacency, while nurturing deeper private sector investment beyond consumption spending. Macroeconomic indicators alone don’t tell the whole story. Investors are increasingly sensitive to political undercurrents that could reshape growth trajectories. International benchmarks such as Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index continue to place the Philippines in a challenging light, with a score of 33 out of 100 and a rank around 114th of 180 countries. While this represents a slight improvement over prior years, it remains below regional and global averages, suggesting persistent governance gaps. Domestically, these perceptions have translated into visible political unrest. In 2025, mass protests erupted nationwide in response to a sprawling corruption scandal involving flood control and infrastructure funds — one of the largest civic mobilizations in years. Subsequent criminal charges have ensnared dozens of political and business figures, including high-level legislators, underscoring both the depth of the problem and the political will to pursue accountability, however unevenly. At the same time, recent surveys from the Philippine Observatory on Democracy indicate rising public concern over corruption, disinformation and civic disengagement — signals that democratic legitimacy may be as consequential an economic variable as tax policy or tariff rates. Externally, the national economy is vulnerable to trends well beyond its borders. Efforts to diversify exports face headwinds from shifting US trade policy and global tariff regimes which, analysts say, could dampen export competitiveness and investment flows in 2026. Compared with its peers in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Philippines sits in a mid-tier competitive band — beating some neighbors, but still trailing the likes of Indonesia and Vietnam in composite influence measures that weigh economic strength, diplomacy, and technological capacity. So where does this leave the country in the year ahead? On the economic front, the Philippines has the fundamentals — the demographic dividend, robust remittances, resilient consumption — to sustain growth. But converting these advantages into higher, sustained investment and productivity gains will require sharper policy execution, deeper structural reform, and more attractive conditions for long-horizon investors. On the political front, the unfolding drama around governance and corruption could be a tipping point. Clean, transparent institutions aren’t just moral imperatives — they are economic multipliers that unlock investor confidence, reduce risk premia, and widen the tax base. The Philippines’ growth story is far from finished; it has merely entered a new chapter — one in which policy coherence, not just headline figures, will define the country’s place on the global economic stage. If the next year is about choices, then the most consequential one is this: Will the Philippines reinforce its growth foundations with credible governance, or will political ambiguity undermine its economic promise? Quo Vadis, Philippines? Markets are watching, and increasingly so its own citizens. – Rappler.com Click here for more Vantage Point articles.",True,true,"[Vantage Point] A year of reckoning: Which way, Philippines?",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-year-of-reckoning-which-way-philippines/,Rappler
"It seems DTI’s P500 Noche Buena claim has struck a national nerve — our inbox proves it. Thank you to everyone who urged us to take this topic on. And thank you, too, for your unwavering support and the kind (and often very candid) suggestions that help keep Vantage Point bold, relevant, and fun to read. Our gratitude for your continued trust, the thoughtful insights, and the loyalty you’ve shown us through the years. Your engagement is the reason this column keeps evolving. Very much appreciated. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has finally solved one of the great mysteries of our time: how to feed a Filipino family on Christmas Eve with only P500. In a country where onions once flirted with gold-standard pricing and where ham now comes in artisanal micro-sizes, DTI has done the impossible. They have bent arithmetic so far that Euclid — father of geometry — would file a complaint: transforming policy into a performance art. It began innocently enough. The agency released its annual Noche Buena price guide (see full list at the end of this article), and in it, like a magician pulling a rabbit from a severely stressed hat, it declared that a family could assemble a whole Christmas meal for half a thousand pesos. After the internet collectively choked on its hot chocolate, Trade Secretary Cristina Roque clarified that P500 is not for “lavish” families — just for those comfortable celebrating Christmas on “airline-economy” terms: no legroom, no free drinks, and please clap when we land. Still, the claim demanded investigation. After all, this is the same government that once said rice would hit P20 per kilo — proof that optimism is either the nation’s greatest strength or its most persistent hallucination. DTI’s own numbers show the cheapest ham begins around P170, a price point so low that even supermarket staff stare at it with suspicion. Processed cheese starts at P56.50 — though at that price, it may legally classify as a dairy-adjacent substance. Pasta drops to P32 only if you are willing to buy a pack so small that it suggests the manufacturer has trust issues. Fruit cocktail begins in the P61 range, which is impressive considering 40% of it is syrup, 30% is unidentified cubes, and 30% is existential doubt. Add all-purpose cream at P36.50, mix everything with hope, and the total hovers around P385. Technically, it works — if you use DTI math. DTI math is a special branch of numeracy where everything aligns perfectly on spreadsheets, but not necessarily in physical space, or reality, or kitchens with actual people in them. By their arithmetic, four people can share one small ham, a modest plate of plain spaghetti, and a small bowl of salad with tiny fruit cubes you need to eat with tweezers. You’re no longer treated to a feast, but served a mere concept. It’s a jolly salute to a holiday mood board or a meal for four persons presented in “tokenized” form. The larger problem is that a Christmas Noche Buena basket in the Philippines has not been priced at P500 since… well, since the era when texting cost P1 per message and people still believed Santa Claus could find the Philippines on his first try. Back in 2020, a mid-sized ham cost P135 to P189; queso de bola was between P199 and P320. Today, thanks to inflation and the creative ambitions of meat processors, those numbers have drifted into luxury-boutique territory. Ham now stretches up to P930; queso de bola sits comfortably in the P210 to P445 bracket. Christmas has gentrified. Various holiday basket indices put forth by internet sleuths averaged the cost: from 2011 to 2023, Noche Buena staples rose 25.4%. In 2022, inflation for December hit 8.1% — roughly the same rise as the collective blood pressure of Filipino grocery shoppers that year. Prices have stabilized, but only in the same way a plane stabilizes after losing an engine: it stops dropping, but it’s still nowhere near the altitude it used to be. This is what makes the P500 claim so spectacularly insensitive. It requires the Filipino family to shop with the precision of a hedge fund analyst, the appetite of migrating swallows, and the optimism of someone who still believes government budgeting hearings are straightforward. It requires a household where no one asks for soft drinks, rice, hotdogs, bread, extra serving portions, or joy. It assumes that Christmas is a minimalist Scandinavian experience — ham as accent piece, pasta as decor, fruit salad as garnish for your hopes. It doesn’t help that every Filipino grocery shopper knows the truth. A kilo of mainstream pasta averages P80 to P110. Cheese, cream, and ham swing higher depending on the brand, store, or lunar alignment. One viral grocery post this year documented a mother spending P2,000 for five days of basic meals — an entire week’s worth of food that still didn’t include anything resembling a holiday. So why did DTI insist so forcefully that P500 works? Because somewhere along the line, the agency confused technical possibility with practical reality. They built a feast the way a startup founder builds a pitch deck: everything looks good at the lowest-cost assumptions and none of the variables include human needs or gravity. The irony is that the agency actually has good data. Its price guides are real and useful for tracking food inflation. But instead of saying, “Look, this is how high holiday prices have climbed over the last decade,” it chose to declare, like an overeager accountant, that P500 is absolutely enough if the family practices strict caloric minimalism and embraces the spiritual discipline of ignoring hunger. By now, Vantage Point readers already know that markets punish companies that pretend everything is fine when the financials make it obvious they’re not. Consumers do the same. When the government fails basic addition — taking the cheapest item from every category, adding them up, and declaring it a festive miracle — the public notices. The math doesn’t lie, but the presentation does acrobatics. In the end, the P500 Noche Buena is not a national policy. It is a Christmas fable, written by an agency performing narrative gymnastics to prove that inflation has not stolen Christmas — it has merely “simplified” it. And perhaps, in its own unintentional way, DTI has given the country a new holiday tradition: the annual performance review of math itself. Because if this is how government arithmetic works, next year they may tell us that P300 is enough for Media Noche, P50 can fund a New Year’s fireworks display, and P20 per kilo of rice is just around the corner — operational soon, in theory, pending budget, assuming ideal conditions, adjusting for optimism. Until then, the Filipino consumer will continue doing what they’ve always done: practicing their own math — the kind rooted in grocery receipts, not government spreadsheets. And unlike DTI’s version, their arithmetic always adds up. – Rappler.com",True,true,"[Vantage Point] The P500 Noche Buena: Rewriting math, economics, and the laws of physics",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-noche-buena-budget-controversy-2025/,Rappler
"BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – The Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) said it has secured a series of favorable court rulings related to Camp John Hay, citing recent dismissals of multiple civil cases involving land claims within the John Hay Special Economic Zone. In a statement, BCDA said the Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 79 of Baguio City dismissed six cases filed by private parties, including petitions for quieting of title, recovery of possession, and a promissory estoppel case. The cases involved properties located within the former American military reservation now managed by BCDA. BCDA said the rulings support its position following the government’s takeover of Camp John Hay and provide greater legal clarity over land administration within the zone. “These rulings help provide stability for investors and stakeholders,” BCDA chairperson Larry Paredes said, adding that the agency believes the decisions allow it to move forward with redevelopment plans for the property. BCDA president and chief executive officer Joshua Bingcang likewise said the dismissals reinforce the agency’s efforts to reposition Camp John Hay as a mixed-use development, citing models such as Bonifacio Global City and New Clark City. The dismissed cases form part of a larger set of legal disputes arising after the Supreme Court upheld the government’s reclamation of Camp John Hay in 2024, enforcing a 2015 arbitral ruling that ordered Camp John Hay Development Corporation (CJHDevCo) and entities claiming rights under it to vacate the leased property. Following that ruling, several civil and criminal cases were filed involving land claims and post-rescission transactions inside the estate. Earlier this year, the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) Branch 5 in Baguio City dismissed a criminal case for “other deceits” against CJHDevCo chairman Robert John Sobrepeña and Fil-Estate Management Incorporated vice president Ramon Jimenez. The court dismissed the case after the private complainants filed an affidavit of desistance, withdrawing their interest in pursuing the charges. In a subsequent manifestation, City Prosecutor Christian Amistad clarified that the dismissal was based solely on the complainants’ withdrawal and not on any judicial determination of the merits of the case, disputing public statements that framed the outcome as an acquittal. The Department of Justice has since created a special task force to look into transactions conducted after the rescission of CJHDevCo’s lease, signaling that other cases related to Camp John Hay may still arise. BCDA said it is finalizing an updated master development plan for Camp John Hay, describing the project as a self-sustaining, mixed-use district that will integrate ecotourism, commercial activity, education, healthcare, and green infrastructure. The agency said the plan is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and is being coordinated with the Baguio City government. BCDA said the redevelopment aims to generate employment and economic activity while preserving the area’s environmental character. City officials, however, have repeatedly raised concerns over unresolved issues related to revenue sharing, barangay segregation, and compliance with the 19 conditionalities set by the Baguio City Council in 1994, matters that the city government has said may soon be brought to court.

"MANILA, Philippines – In direct response to the rising cost of living and escalating consumer prices, the Department of Finance (DOF) is proposing significant increases in tax-free benefits and allowances for both private and public sector employees. The proposal aims to provide much-needed financial relief, improve labor conditions, and enhance social protection for Filipino families, but one question still remains: Will this at last ease the burden carried by Filipino homes? The proposal introduces substantial adjustments to several key monetary allowances. The non-taxable rice subsidy is set to increase from P2,000 to P2,500 per month (or its market equivalent). Similarly, the semi-annual medical cash allowance for dependents will be raised from P1,500 to P2,000. The DOF also seeks to hike the ceiling for actual medical assistance from P10,000 to P12,000 per year and increase the monthly laundry allowance from P300 to P400. Furthermore, the tax-free limit for meal allowance for overtime or night-shift work will be boosted from 25% to 30% of the minimum wage. Adjustments are also proposed for other essential and incentive-based benefits. The annual non-taxable threshold for uniform and clothing allowance will climb from P7,000 to P8,000. For incentives, employee achievement awards are set to increase from P10,000 to P12,000 per year, and the limit for Christmas or anniversary gifts will rise from P5,000 to P6,000 annually. Additionally, the combined tax-free ceiling for Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) and productivity incentives will go up from P10,000 to P12,000 per year. Finally, the DOF addresses leave credits, a vital component of employee compensation. For private employees, the tax-exempt ceiling for monetized unused vacation leave credits will be expanded from 10 days to 12 days. The current uncapped benefit for government employees’ monetized vacation and sick leave will be retained. The true legislative effort that will finally ease the financial burden on the Filipino family is the strategic, comprehensive reform to reduce the Value-Added Tax (VAT) rate from 12% to 10% combined with a significant increase in the income tax exemption threshold. The core advantages for Filipino families from this combined approach provide substantial financial relief: the 2% VAT cut immediately translates into a direct price reduction on goods and services, giving consumers savings (e.g., approximately P200 for every P10,000 spent) and restoring purchasing power. Crucially, the increase in the income tax exemption from P250,000 to a proposed P400,000 to P500,000 provides relief on the income side by making a larger portion of annual earnings tax-free, directly resulting in a higher net take-home pay. This two-pronged relief is particularly targeted to benefit the middle class, ensuring they keep more of the money they earn and pay less when they spend it, thereby maximizing the boost to the family’s overall financial health and security. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Ask the Tax Whiz] Beyond pampalubag-loob: What reform will truly give PH households relief?,https://www.rappler.com/business/ask-the-tax-whiz-department-finance-proposal-free-benefits-filipino-workers/,Rappler
"(This is a press release from the Asian Forum on Enterprise for Society 2025.) On November 11–12, the Asian Institute of Management (AIM) will convene the Asian Forum on Enterprise for Society (AFES) 2025 at the Makati Shangri-La. The forum comes at a moment defined by accelerating disruption — climate instability, fractured geopolitics, and the rapid advance of artificial intelligence — and will address the responsibilities of enterprises in navigating these challenges with resilience and purpose. Two keynote speakers will frame the proceedings. Ban Ki-moon, former secretary-general of the United Nations, is widely recognized for his leadership in advancing the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, chairman of Ayala Corporation, has been a leading advocate for sustainability-driven corporate transformation in Asia. Together, they represent the convergence of international diplomacy and private enterprise in addressing the urgent demands of the present. With the theme “Navigating Disruption: Enterprise Priorities for a Resilient Future,” AFES 2025 will focus on the most pressing issues confronting business and society. Discussions will explore climate solutions rooted in nature, the ethical integration of artificial intelligence, the imperatives of diversity and inclusion, and the role of education in preparing the next generation for resilience. The forum will also highlight the potential of micro-entrepreneurship and inclusive finance to empower communities, while closing sessions will examine how to reinforce global supply chains and sustain collaborative commitments that balance profitability with broader social responsibility. For AIM, which has trained leaders in Asia for more than half a century, hosting AFES reflects a mission that stretches beyond management education. It is an assertion that enterprises, particularly in a region defined by both volatility and vitality, can be engines not only of economic growth but also of social progress. Launched in 2002, AFES has become the region’s leading platform for dialogue between business and society, convened through AIM’s Ramon V. Del Rosario Sr. Center for Corporate Responsibility. Its purpose has always been to test the ways in which power — corporate, political, and civic — might be aligned with the imperatives of a sustainable future. – Rappler.com For more information, visit afes.aim.edu.",True,true,Former UN chief Ban Ki-moon to speak in AFES 2025 forum in Makati,https://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/events/asian-forum-enterprise-society-november-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Maine Mendoza has come to the defense of her husband, Quezon City 1st District Representative Juan Carlos “Arjo” Atayde, yet again. Atayde continues to receive public backlash after contractor couple Sarah Discaya and Pacifico “Curlee” Discaya expressed their desire to act as state witnesses in the flood control scandal. The Discaya couple named the actor-turned-politician as one of the 17 public officials who allegedly demanded kickbacks from them. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, September 10, Mendoza maintained her husband’s innocence, attesting that they are honest taxpayers who do not rely on the taxes of the Filipino people to fund their lifestyle. “Both of us (and our families) are financially capable of sustaining the lives that we live, and it’s personally offensive to be accused of spending money that we have rightfully earned outside politics. It’s unfair to reduce everything that we are and everything that we have worked for to that single narrative,” Mendoza wrote. The Eat Bulaga! mainstay said that if Atayde were to ever do anything dishonest, she “certainly wouldn’t defend him and cover for him.” Atayde himself denied the Discayas’ claims in an Instagram story on September 8, saying that he has “never dealt” with the contractor couple. Rappler, however, obtained and published photos of the Topakk actor posing with Curlee and Sarah. An old photo from Atayde’s own Facebook page had also resurfaced — showing him looking at a tarpaulin for a P50-million flood project helmed by Wawao Builders. Atayde has since taken the photo down. Wawao Builders had become one of the top Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) contractors starting 2022. Public Works Secretary Manuel Bonoan earlier stated that they had initial information that some of the firm’s flood control projects in Bulacan were ghost projects. Seemingly alluding to these photos, Mendoza said that they were taken out of context, and asked that the public not forget that “perception is not always reality.” “It is truly distressing to see people suffer in times of crisis because of corrupt politicians who put self-interest above all else, alongside their accomplices. Nakakagalit talaga (It really is infuriating). And we also believe those who are truly guilty should face accountability. Again, the truth will reveal itself in the end. We can only hope and pray that the justice system delivers justice to those who deserve it and to whom it’s due. I know we may be easy targets, but you are condemning the wrong people,” the 30-year-old showbiz personality continued. Mendoza further added that her husband plans to take legal action to clear his name. “Arjo has nothing to hide. He has never been guilty of stealing. I’ll end with this, not all politicians are corrupt — some are just convenient targets. The real villains are celebrating quietly in the shadows,” Mendoza said. This lengthy statement comes after the actress made a brief post on X referring to the Discayas’ claims as “baseless allegations,” asking the public to refrain from spewing hate comments at Atayde “until facts come out.” Atayde was reelected as Quezon City 1st District representative in the 2025 midterm elections. He tied the knot with Mendoza in 2023. – Rappler.com",True,true,Maine Mendoza on Arjo Atayde backlash: ‘You are condemning the wrong people’,https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/maine-mendoza-arjo-atayde-backlash-statement/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Audit (COA) flagged the Social Security System (SSS)’s failure to collect the entire P93.747 billion in unpaid or unremitted premium contributions from employers. State auditors discovered that the state insurer has only collected 4.89% or only P4.58 billion out of the total outstanding balance. This leaves at least P89.17 billion that are yet to be collected from 420,627 employers. COA said that this has a direct impact on the agency’s ability to carry out its mandate, adding that it “deprives SSS of much-needed funds for the timely delivery of social security protection, claims, and benefits, to its members and their beneficiaries.” It also pointed out that majority of these employers — at least 349,189 — did not avail of the installment plan offered by SSS, practically ignoring the government’s efforts to help them fulfill their obligation. Meanwhile, at least 70,975 employers were tagged as “inactive, under temporary suspension, or with closed/dormant accounts” which totaled P25.774 billion. SSS said it cannot force employers to pay and blamed the delay in cases filed before courts against delinquent employers. These factors also include the non-apprehension of company leaders as well as the changes in judges. Among the factors it blamed for the delay are non-apprehension of company executives, dilatory tactics being employed by the counsel of defendant companies, and the retirement, transfer or promotion of judges who are handling the cases. These huge amounts of uncollected payments exist in the face of another increase in contributions of private sector workers scheduled by January 2025. Despite this, it is stated in the Social Security Act of 2018 that failure to remit contribution “shall not prejudice the right of the covered employee to the benefits of the coverage.” COA, however, stated that this weak performance in collecting premium would require SSS to exert more effort to pay for benefits. – Rappler.com",True,true,COA hits SSS’ continued failure to collect P89-billion contributions from employers,https://www.rappler.com/nation/commission-audit-hits-social-security-system-continued-failure-collect-contributions-private-employers/,Rappler
"The Philippines sits at the center of a moral paradox in the global climate debate. Producing barely less than 1% of global emissions, the country is among those most exposed to climate risks, yet least capable of influencing the planet’s temperature trajectory. Demanding rapid net-zero sacrifices from a developing economy may satisfy global optics, but it does little to alter climate outcomes, while imposing real costs on households, businesses, and competitiveness. True climate justice, in this context, is not measured by symbolic targets, but by whether energy policy protects development, keeps electricity affordable, and avoids turning power into a privilege for the few. The more durable path forward is disciplined pragmatism. The Philippines must pursue renewables aggressively, without destabilizing the grid or pricing growth out of reach. An all-of-the-above energy strategy that preserves reliable baseload power, while scaling clean technologies, is not ideological compromise; it is economic necessity. Development itself is the country’s strongest climate defense, enabling resilience, adaptation, and long-term decarbonization. The choice is not between climate responsibility and growth. For the Philippines, the only climate strategy that endures is one that keeps the lights on, the bills manageable, and the economy moving forward. Every typhoon season brings the same moral refrain: the Philippines must accelerate toward net zero to protect itself from climate catastrophe. It is a noble instinct. It is also, on its own, a misleading one. Net zero is an attempt to balance the amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) released into the atmosphere and the amount removed. The uncomfortable arithmetic is unavoidable. The Philippines accounts for roughly 0.46% of GHG emissions. Even if the country miraculously achieved net zero overnight, the trajectory of global warming would remain largely unchanged, driven by the far larger carbon footprints of industrial economies. Climate change would not pause. Storms would not politely weaken at our borders. The planet would continue warming because global problems do not respond to unilateral sacrifice by marginal emitters. This reality does not absolve the Philippines of responsibility, but it does demand honesty. Climate change is a collective-action problem, and pretending otherwise risks turning moral urgency into economic self-harm. When a developing country bears heavy costs for outcomes it cannot meaningfully influence, the result is not climate justice but a misplaced virtue. That distinction matters because the costs are not abstract. They arrive monthly, printed on electricity bills, absorbed by households whose pockets are already stretched thin. They appear in factory margins, in food prices, and in the quiet erosion of competitiveness that determines whether jobs are created or lost. An energy transition that prices power beyond the reach of ordinary Filipinos is not just politically fragile — it is socially regressive. This is where the conversation must shift from symbolism to substance. I get it that climate justice for the Philippines begins not with emissions targets, but with development. History offers no counterexample: no country has lifted millions out of poverty without abundant, reliable, and affordable energy. Electricity is not a luxury add-on to growth; it is its precondition. Clinics cannot refrigerate vaccines on intermittent power. Schools cannot teach effectively through rolling brownouts. Manufacturing cannot scale on unstable grids. For a country still climbing the development ladder, asking the poorest households to shoulder higher power costs in the name of global emissions reduction — when their contribution to the problem is negligible — is a moral misallocation. Justice, in this context, means refusing to make electricity a privilege only of the affluent. That moral boundary leads naturally to a harder, more pragmatic conclusion: energy policy must be judged by outcomes, not intentions. The Philippines needs renewables. Solar, wind, and other clean technologies are essential to long-term sustainability, diversification, and resilience. But they are not yet substitutes for dispatchable baseload power. Their variability is a technical constraint, not an ideological one. Until storage becomes cheap and scalable, the grid requires firm capacity — from coal, gas, and other conventional sources — to remain stable and affordable. An energy strategy that treats this reality as heresy rather than physics is not progressive; it is reckless. Brownouts are not climate solutions. Neither are power rates that render local manufacturing uncompetitive and quietly export jobs to countries with cheaper electricity and dirtier grids. This is why the most defensible transition strategy is not technological purity, but technology agnosticism. An all-of-the-above energy mix is not a betrayal of climate goals: it is the only way to sequence the transition without breaking the economy in the process. The objective is not to delay renewables, but to integrate them without destabilizing the system they depend on. Affordability, therefore, must be the true north. Not because carbon does not matter, but because costs do. Electricity prices ripple through the economy, shaping inflation, investment decisions, and employment. When power becomes expensive, everything else follows. A climate policy that ignores this reality will not survive voter scrutiny, investor discipline, or basic arithmetic. The irony is that development itself is one of the most effective forms of climate adaptation. Wealthier societies build stronger infrastructure, enforce better standards, and recover faster from disasters. They invest in resilience because they can afford to. A poorer Philippines, constrained by high energy costs and stalled growth, is more — not less — vulnerable to climate shocks. This is the sequencing problem many climate debates refuse to confront. The question is not whether the Philippines should decarbonize. It should, and it will. The real question is whether it can do so without undermining the very economic base that makes adaptation and resilience possible. The answer lies in disciplined pragmatism. Build renewables aggressively where they are cost-effective. Strengthen the grid. Improve market design. Encourage competition. Deploy storage when it makes economic sense, not when it makes headlines. And use conventional energy as the bridge it was always meant to be — not as a permanent crutch, but as insurance against fragility. In a world of absolutes, this approach may sound insufficiently heroic. But in the real world — where households pay bills, factories compete, and governments face elections — it is the only strategy that lasts. The Philippines cannot save the planet on its own. But it can refuse to impoverish itself chasing the illusion that it can. Climate responsibility, for a developing nation, is not about symbolic sacrifice. It is about building an economy strong enough to endure — and smart enough to transition without collapse. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] The truth about net-zero emissions,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-truth-net-zero-emissions/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Commissioner Charlito Mendoza said all letters of authority (LOAs) will now require his approval before they are issued as part of ongoing audit reforms to prevent its misuse. Mendoza disclosed this to the Senate blue ribbon committee hearing on Thursday, December 11. Prior to the announcement, LOAs – which usually signal the start of a tax audit – were issued at the regional level. “Right now po, when it comes to the issuance of letters of authority by the regional directors, meron po silang absolute authority to issue letters of authority. And hindi na po ito umaakyat sa Commissioner for approval or prior clearance,” he said. (Right now, the regional directors have absolute authority to issue letters of authority, and this is not escalated to the Commissioner for approval or prior clearance.) Mendoza also said that the BIR plans to limit the number of LOAs that taxpayers can receive to prevent its misuse. “These improvements, many of which can be enabled with the help of an integrated digital system, will reinforce the checks and balances between enforcement and oversight,” he said. The BIR originally suspended field audit operations following several reports that LOAs were used to extort bribes from businessmen and other taxpayers. Senators JV Ejercito and Erwin Tulfo claimed that BIR personnel kept as much as 70% from these collections. Despite its current misuse, former BIR commissioner Kim Henares said that LOAs remain an essential tool for effective collection, citing a study that found the BIR failed to collect P1 trillion in taxes due to tax evasion and related concerns.

"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia – China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) signed an upgrade to their free trade agreement on Tuesday, October 28, with leaders hailing the deal which spans the digital and green economy, and other new industries. The 11-member ASEAN is China’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totaling $771 billion last year, according to ASEAN statistics. China is seeking to intensify its engagement with ASEAN, a region with a collective gross domestic product of $3.8 trillion, to counter hefty import tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump’s administration on countries around the world. “We must accelerate trade and investment liberalization and facilitation and strengthen industrial integration and interdependence,” Chinese Premier Li Qiang said at the ASEAN leaders’ meeting on Tuesday. Beijing has been seeking to position itself as a more open economy, despite criticism from other major powers of its expanding export restrictions on rare earths and other critical minerals. The so-called 3.0 version of the free trade agreement between ASEAN and China was signed into effect at a summit of the bloc’s leaders in Malaysia, which Trump attended on Sunday, October 26, at the start of a trip through Asia. Negotiations on the upgraded ASEAN-China deal began in November 2022 and concluded in May this year, just after Trump’s tariff offensive kicked into gear. The first FTA came into force in 2010. “The upgrade will further reduce trade barriers, strengthen supply chain connectivity, and unlock opportunities in future growth areas,” Singapore’s Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said. China has previously said the agreement would pave the way for improved market access in sectors such as agriculture, the digital economy, and pharmaceuticals between China and ASEAN. Both China and ASEAN are part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world’s largest trading bloc, which covers nearly a third of the global population and about 30% of global gross domestic product. Malaysia hosted an RCEP summit in Kuala Lumpur on Monday, October 27, the first in five years. The bloc is seen by some analysts as a potential buffer against tariffs imposed by the United States, though its provisions are considered weaker than some other regional trade deals due to competing interests among its members. Standing in the way of China taking a leading role in regional trade cooperation are heightened concerns around Beijing’s military ambitions. On Monday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. criticized Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, where the two countries have been engaged in a series of confrontations. Beijing’s foreign office responded to Marcos’ statement by saying the clashes were due to provocation from Manila. China claims almost the entire resource-rich waterway on its official maps, overlapping with parts of the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Unresolved disputes have festered for years over ownership of multiple islands and features. “We must strengthen strategic mutual trust,” Li said in his Tuesday address. “We must accelerate consultations on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea and strive for an early conclusion.” Wong also raised the flashpoint as a key diplomatic issue. “Inevitably, there will be differences of views around the South China Sea, but all of us agree that peace, stability, safety, and freedom of navigation and overflight, are critical in this important waterway.” China has been engaged in an escalating trade war with the United States since Trump took office in January and imposed steep tariffs on Chinese goods. Beijing has labeled Trump’s tariffs, which have hit most countries, as protectionism, while expanding its controls over the flow of its critical minerals and magnets. China processes more than 90% of the world’s rare earths. The world’s two largest economies extended a trade truce when negotiators met in Kuala Lumpur on the weekend, hashing out an agreement for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to decide later this week when they meet in Seoul. Since Trump departed Malaysia on Monday morning, China has pressed for increased economic cooperation in the region, stressing the importance of open trade. “The world must not slip back to the law of the jungle where the strong prey on the weak,” Premier Li said at a different event on Monday. “We should more firmly uphold the free trade regime, create a high-standard regional free trade network, and vigorously and effectively advance regional integration.” – Rappler.com",True,true,"China and ASEAN, hit by US tariffs, sign upgraded free trade pact",https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/asean-china-free-trade-area-upgrade-signing-2025/,Rappler
"In my last article, I mentioned that there were three key factors blamed for the market’s continued weakness which made it as one of the world’s worst performing markets. The first was about the imminent threat on the country’s political stability as precipitated by the corruption scandal in the government’s flood control program and now compounded by the recent divisive playbooks mounted by the political opposition designed to undermine – if not oust – President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. and his administration. This is followed by the government’s weak spending or underspending activity to spur the economy and by the structural issues confronting the market. These factors also basically explain why the market has become a value trap. A value trap is about a stock or market that appears cheap based on traditional metrics but is actually a poor investment. The reason behind this is that because of its underlying fundamental weaknesses, a stock or market’s valuation will continue to fall. As such, buying a stock or into the market solely based on its low-price metrics, without regard to examining why it is cheap, makes investors fall into what is called a value trap. A comparative look at the performances of the other ASEAN markets in the region, namely Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, may also add to our further understanding on why our market is doing this badly. A cursory review on the performance drivers of these markets may show us enough why. Let us then take a look at what these markets have that our market does not. Based on data from the World Bank, IMF, and regional banks, as gathered by Joel de la Peña, chief trader and market strategist of H.E. Bennett Securities Incorporated, the market status of Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines show a massive performance divergence in 2025 while manifesting a competitive picture of economic growth. Vietnam Exchange Vietnam’s growth is reportedly the most robust, supported by its proactive policy reforms. Its gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been leading in the region, with projections reaching as high as 8.3% for the full year of 2025, driven by exports, investment, and strong domestic consumption. Its foreign direct investment (FDI) is its single biggest driver. FDI reached US$21.52 billion in the first half of 2025, a record of +32.6% year-on-year. (In This Economy: Did PH miss being an upper middle-income country by just $26?) In Vietnam, global companies continue to relocate manufacturing and supply chain operations, especially for high-tech companies for its lower costs and stability. Foreign investors are also piling in investments ahead of a potential upgrade to its stock market by FTSE Russell to Emerging Market status, which could unlock significant new passive capital inflows. The total number of companies listed across Vietnam’s three main stock markets is approximately 1,700 divided into 400 large-cap, 330 mid-cap, and 870 to 900 small-cap business firms with about 393 stockbrokerage houses operating to handle transactions. Liquidity in is exceptionally high. Average daily trading value has been fluctuating between US$1.3 billion to $2.1 billion. In August, Vietnam’s stock market was able to register a single-day record of over $3 billion. Indonesia Stock Exchange As supported by strong domestic economic fundamentals and a healthy capital market, Indonesia has a large and diverse list of firms, consisting of over 903 companies and about 558 stockbrokerage houses. Its large and growing consumer base provides a stable anchor for economic growth and corporate earnings, making it less vulnerable to global trade shocks than its peers. GDP growth has been steady, backed by high commodity prices and sustained domestic consumption. Needless to say, Indonesia is a major commodity exporter. Indonesia has also dominated the initial public offering (IPO) activities in the region, bringing fresh, high-growth listings to the market and maintaining investor confidence. Based on early 2025 data from the Indonesia Capital Market, the average daily trading volume for Indonesia’s stock market is around 18 billion shares and the average daily trading value is approximately $700 million. The Stock Exchange of Thailand Thailand’s stock market has been in a long-term downtrend. Its earnings multiple (P/E ratio) has barely increased for a decade, too. Its economic growth has been suffering as well, averaging to only about 1.9%. Thailand’s market has 860 listed companies with 548 stockbrokerage houses. Thailand’s present market struggles are tied to structural economic growth challenges. Also, foreign investors have been net sellers, contributing to the market’s decline. While tourism is recovering, overall growth has been relatively soft compared to its ASEAN rivals, leading to a downgrade of Thai stocks by major global investment banks. (In This Economy: How traveling abroad made me see the real state of the nation) Bursa Malaysia Malaysia’s economy has shown robust growth in the past, driven by the services and manufacturing sectors that make up to 59.2% and 23.4% of the country’s GDP, respectively. This performance was supported by a strong recovery in domestic demand, exports, and investments, alongside a resilient labor market. Malaysia’s economy is likewise more diversified and less exposed to some external vulnerabilities compared to the Philippines. Yet, as of mid-November 2025, Malaysia’s stock market has seen a year-to-date (YTD) loss of approximately 0.91%. As of November, too, there are a total of approximately 1,091 listed companies across three markets on Malaysia’s stock exchange, namely 808 on the primary “Main market,” 236 on the secondary ”Ace market,” and 236 companies on the tertiary “Leap market.” There are at least “12 primary stockbrokerage houses” offering stockbroking services in Malaysia’s main market. Some of these include major local and international banks and investment firms. While future economic growth is expected to be positive, forecasts indicate that this may be moderated by global factors like trade tensions and rising inflation concerns. Philippine Stock Exchange The Philippines has been consistently reported to be among the fastest-growing economies in the region largely driven by robust domestic demand. However, its stock market’s underperformance is the most severe due to the confluence of at least three major issues relative to governance issues, economic slowdown, and structural flaws. Amid these issues, the country’s foreign direct investment (FDI) also dropped sharply. In August 2025, FDI declined by as much as 40.5% — suggesting that foreign capital is fleeing due to instability and political risk. Together with the recent weather disruptions, the country’s 3rd quarter GDP growth slowed down to 4%, its lowest pace in four years. With about 285 listed companies and 122 stockbrokerage houses, the market’s daily trading volume has been fluctuating significantly from about 110 million shares to 291 million shares while daily value turnover has remained low at no more than $110.0 million. Vietnam is the undisputed star performer among the four other ASEAN markets. Its performance is driven by robust economic growth (the best in the region), by strong FDI, and by regulatory reforms aimed at achieving Emerging Market status, which is expected to channel billions of dollars into the market. Additionally, its yield-to-date (YTD) returns are well over +30%. Indonesia has a “solid” stock market. It is fueled by its large market and strong liquidity, as a reward for its structural reforms and equally high economic growth. It has dominated regional IPO activity, bagging the status of being the second-best stock market performer. Thailand is facing headwinds that its economy is in a “moderate decline.” Growth is also moderated due to softer tourism and consumption. Comparatively, while Thailand’s stock market is slightly underperforming, it is better balanced in composition which is why it is better performing than the Philippines. Malaysia presents a more stable, mature economic picture, with steady growth, lower inflation, a robust labor market, and a better-performing stock market. Its economy is more diversified and less exposed to some external vulnerabilities compared to the Philippines. Like the Philippines but having the better edge, it is currently underperforming, penalized for slow structural growth, unbalanced corporate and market concentration. The Malaysian ringgit also demonstrated greater strength against the US dollar in comparison to the Philippine peso during the year. The Philippines clearly lags behind despite of its reported higher real GDP growth rates as one of the fastest-expanding economies in the region, which is largely driven by resilient household spending and a strong services sector, and remittances from overseas workers. Nonetheless, this growth has been accompanied by a weaker currency and volatility in FDI inflows. To catch up, it’s clear that the Philippines has to immediately take drastic measures to address the negative pressures from its structural issues, low market diversity, and weak investment flows due to low investors’ confidence arising from political and governance issues.

"MANILA, Philippines – For the third straight year, it’s in the Philippines’ property sector where Filipino woman leadership in business has been recognized by Forbes Asia, a publication that chronicles entrepreneurial success and economic growth in the region. Mybelle Aragon-Gobio, 52, the first woman to head the Gokongwei family’s property conglomerate, Robinsons Land Corporation (RLC), and Mariana Zobel de Ayala, chair and president of Ayalaland Malls Incorporated, are the two Filipino women on the publication’s 2025 list of “power businesswomen” in Asia. The list, Forbes Asia said, recognizes “20 accomplished leaders who are at the forefront of the region’s fast-evolving business and economic landscape.” Forbes Asia noted that Aragon-Gobio is also the first non-Gokongwei family member to head the firm founded by the late John Gokongwei. She succeeded the patriarch’s only son, Lance Gokongwei, as head of RLC. (READ: Why John Gokongwei donated billions to education) She rose from the ranks and has been with RLC for over 26 years.

"MANILA, Philippines – Chinese fast-food restaurant chain Chowking is reinventing itself in a pivot to the Philippines’ young demographic. Chowking, now 40 years old, has been rolling out new concept stores that it hopes can further entice the GenZ market or those who were not yet born when ChowKing was first established by its founder, Robert Fung Kuan, in 1985. The Jollibee Group acquired Chowking in 2000. How best to get more GenZs to dine in a legacy fast-food brand? One tack is to make the stores Instagrammable. The strategy may not be obvious to those who live in Metro Manila, since most of the concept stores are in the provinces. Take the case of the newly opened Chowking in SM City La Union in the Philippines’ surfing capital in the north. The store’s interior is much brighter than Chowking’s older stores. While older stores have lots of white and some brown colors, the new concept stores have orange, yellow, red as the dominant colors. Various studies have found that the colors orange, yellow, and red help boost appetite. “We’ve just launched our new concept store, and we’re very encouraged by the reception,” Ken Lingan, president of Chowking told ABS-CBN News Channel’s business show Market Edge on October 23. “The thing we’re concerned about is: how does it appeal to the GenZ market. And the actual word we’ve been hearing is, Instagrammable.” The new stores have modern art designs that could make people, young and old, post photos of them dining in Chowking — and get more people to visit. “It’s not just about the food. We want to really elevate the whole experience our consumers have in our stores,” Lingan said. Other outlets with the new concept are: Chowking Nepomall in Angeles City, Pampanga; Chowking SM Marilao, Bulacan; Chowking Buhay na Tubig, Imus City, Cavite; Chowking Robinsons Dumaguete, Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental; and Chowking Batangas Passenger Terminal, Santa Clara, Batangas City. Another strategy to get more young customers? Offer them sugary drinks. More Chowking stores now have Milksha counters. This Taiwanese bubble tea brand is popular among young consumers. Jollibee bought a majority stake in the company behind Milksha in November 2021. Milksha drinks are being paired with Chowking favorites like its top-selling Chao Fan rice dish. As part of its 40th anniversary celebration, Chowking recently held its first-ever Chow Fun Run at the Mall of Asia grounds in Pasay City, a community engagement that helps build real connections with the youth. A post shared by Chowking 超群 (@chowkingph) Chowking has also added more self-order kiosks that young people, unlike many seniors, find easy to use. Lingan said close to half of Chowking’s network of 600 stores already have self-order kiosks. “We believe this adds convenience to our consumers,” he said. Chowking is also reinventing itself in response to a change in consumer behavior brought about partly by the COVID-19 pandemic, with more people working from and eating at home. Whereas dine-in made up the bulk of Chowking’s sales pre-pandemic, Chowking is seeing more consumers turn to take-outs and deliveries post-pandemic. “We now see the emergence of off-premise, and we continue to expand our drive-thru channels and delivery,” said Lingan. “It [drive-thru] used to be less than 10% of our business…. Now, our off-premise channels contribute to close to half our business.” In the next three to five years, Lingan said “close to 50%” of Chowking’s network will have drive-thrus. These are all part of Chowking’s contribution to making the Jollibee Group one of the top 5 food companies in the world. Chowking is also present in six countries outside the Philippines, mainly in the Middle East with 35 stores and 15 in the US, as of end 2024. – Rappler.com",True,true,Chowking reinvents: How this 40-year-old fast-food is pivoting to the GenZ market,https://www.rappler.com/business/chowking-pivot-gen-z-market/,Rappler
"What began as an attempt to defraud a manager of the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) evolved into an opportunity for the country’s oldest bank to learn how scammers transfer funds from their victims’ accounts. In a media roundtable on Wednesday, October 22, BPI’s enterprise information security officer and data protection officer Jon Paz said scammers tried to defraud a channel manager of the bank’s online platform. Paz recalled the manager receiving an email claiming that he needed to update his eGovPH mobile app, and that the sender could help him do this if he filled out a Google Form. “[Up] To this point, all of our knowledge about rogue apps, how these work, had all been anecdotal. They were reported to us by victims,” Paz said. So, they instructed the manager to click the link and input his details with the hopes of understanding the scheme. The manager then received a follow-up call where the scammer requested him to install a remote servicing application masked as the latest version of the eGovPH app. This app gave the caller complete control over the victim’s phone. From there, the scammer disabled key security settings, allowing him to “sideload” or download an application that is not from the phone’s official app store. Paz said this is where things got tricky. The manager’s phone displayed an app installation, but BPI’s IT and data protection team saw something else unfolding behind the scenes. “So what’s being presented to the user is an installation sequence…But behind that, what’s happening is that they’re tinkering with the configurations to allow the app to do a lot more,” he said. Using a fake screen to deceive the victim, the scammer secretly used the login information he obtained to access online banking accounts installed on the phone. Once he gained access to the victim’s bank accounts, the scammer would transfer the funds to his or her own accounts. But online banking apps usually require biometrics or a one-time password (OTP) to complete the transaction. How do scammers get past that? According to Paz, the fake eGovPH app shown to the victim requests for the user’s biometrics to log in. But behind the fake screen, the victim unknowingly authorized the fund transfer to the scammer’s account. Luckily, no funds were stolen in this incident. BPI’s data protection team closely monitored the scammer’s movements, and the attempted fund transfers did not push through since the receiving account was already flagged for its suspected use in scams. Rogue applications or malware are just one of many ways that scammers trick their victims into giving up their login credentials. Scammers also use International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers to send phishing text messages to victims. IMSI catchers, according to a previous Rappler report, “intercept devices by simulating or mimicking cell towers. When connected to an IMSI catcher, calls and text messages as well as a device’s location can be accessed without detection.” Paz said these texts can be compelling since they pretend to be legitimate entities like banks. Global anti-scam application Whoscall logged 62,390 scam calls in the Philippines during the third quarter, 78.4% higher since 2024. (READ: Don’t let online scammers escape. Dial 1326 and report) As scammers employ more sophisticated tactics, BPI’s chief technology officer Alex Seminiano said the bank is strengthening its app’s security through consistent updates and consumer education campaigns. Fraudsters can’t find more victims if no one falls for their tactics. Seminiano urged the public not to share their authentication credentials such as passwords and OTPs with anyone, and enable multi-factor account authentication. “The whole security mechanism of banking is based on trust identification,” Seminiano said. “And therefore, if you share your credentials to somebody else, and somebody else pretends to be you, it’s very difficult to really identify that.” – Rappler.com",True,true,A failed scam attempt gave BPI a glimpse into how fraudsters take your money,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/failed-scam-attempt-bpi-glimpse-how-fraudsters-take-money/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) slashed the country’s key interest rate to 4.5% on Thursday, December 11, amid a faster inflation forecast and weaker outlook on economic growth. BSP Governor Eli Remolona Jr. noted that the monetary authority has shed 2% off the policy rate since August 2024. “The cut will revive economic activity a bit at a time when painful governance issues around infrastructure investments have weakened government spending, business confidence, and domestic demand,” he said. Interest rates are one of many tools a central bank can use to control inflation. A lower interest rate means cheaper borrowing costs, encouraging people to spend more and stimulate the economy. Although the central bank downgraded its 2025 inflation forecast to 1.6%, it hiked its inflation outlook for 2026 and 2027 to 3.2% and 3%, respectively. Remolona noted that business and consumer confidence remains tepid amid ongoing investigations into alleged corruption in public works and within the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Because of this, the BSP expects the economy to recover only by the second half of 2026. “I think the main factor would still be the governance issue. [When] investors and consumers feel that those issues are being addressed, then we should see some recovery,” he explained. The Philippine economy grew only 4% in the third quarter — the lowest since the COVID-19 pandemic — as government infrastructure spending plunged to a 14-year low due to the flood control scandal. While reforms in fiscal policy or the use of taxation and spending to manage an economy would still play a bigger role in resolving governance issues, Remolona said monetary policy can compensate for the negative effects brought by weak consumer and business sentiment. With the latest rate cut, the BSP said it may be nearing the end of its easing cycle. Moving forward, additional rate cuts may be limited and will assess the impact of previous reductions on the economy. Remolona said it may take one to two years before the economy feels the full effect of the rate cuts. “We also hope that government infrastructure spending will return to normal levels and be more effective with reduced leakages, and that investor sentiment and consumer sentiment will improve,” he said. – Rappler.com",True,true,Bangko Sentral cuts policy rate as ‘painful’ corruption woes mute growth outlook,https://www.rappler.com/business/bangko-sentral-pilipinas-monetary-policy-interest-rates-december-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Twenty Philippine business groups are supporting bills that would create an independent body more empowered than the Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) established by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. In a joint statement on Wednesday, December 10, the 20 groups urged the Senate and the House of Representatives to pass the following: The business groups also urged Marcos to certify these bills as urgent. “A fully empowered IPC (Independent People’s Commission) or ICAIC ( Independent Commission Against Infrastructure Corruption) will strengthen the capacity of the Ombudsman and the Department of Justice to pursue corruption cases more effectively and restore credibility to the pursuit of integrity in public service. At present, the ICI functions only in an advisory capacity. It may request the presence of resource persons and recommend courses of action — whether the filing of charges, the seizure of assets, or the issuance of hold-departure orders — but it cannot act decisively on its own,” the business groups said. They said the IPC or ICAIC will have “full investigative and prosecutorial powers” including: “At a time when blatant and widespread misuse of public funds has eroded confidence in our institutions, our nation is confronting a profound crisis of public trust. The Filipino people deserve nothing less than the full truth,” they said. “A truly independent IPC or ICAIC will guarantee transparency and accountability — no cover-up, no sacred cow, no political maneuvering. It will safeguard the people’s money and help rebuild the people’s trust that is essential to a healthy democracy,” they added. On Tuesday, December 9, the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC) included the Independent People’s Commission Act as one of 48 measures in the Common Legislative Agenda for the 20th Congress. The three other reform measures on transparent and accountable governance are: Anti-Dynasty Bill; Party-list System Reform Act; and the Citizen Access and Disclosure of Expenditures for National Accountability (CADENA) Act. In a Department of Economy Planning and Development (DEPDev) media release, the government said Senate Bill No. 1512 on the Independent People’s Commission will consist of five members: 1) a retired Supreme Court justice as chairperson; 2) a Certifiied Public Accountant; 3) an engineer or an architect; 4) a representative from a reputable non-governmental organization; and 5) a representative from the academe. It can conduct motu proprio investigations; issue subpoenas; access records, sites, contracts, and documents; recommend and request freezing of assets; and issue immediate preventive suspension orders against government officials involved. In addition, it will have powers to enter into memoranda of agreement with the Ombudsman, Commission on Audit, Department of Justice (DOJ), and other agencies for joint investigations, cooperative mechanisms, and data sharing. Former public works secretary Rogelio Singson, who resigned from the ICI effective December 15, had lamented the lack of powers of the ICI. He also said the Philippines was way behind countries that have institutionalized anti-corruption bodies. He cited Singapore’s Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau and Hong Kong’s Independent Commission Against Corruption as examples.

"We are what we are now as a country because of Martial Law. So profound and lasting was the Marcos dictatorship (1972–1986) that much of our current underdevelopment in the 21st century can still be attributed to it. This is the main takeaway from a recent journal article that I wrote with Professor Emeritus Emmanuel S. de Dios of the University of the Philippines School of Economics. Titled “Debt, Dictatorship, and Decline: The Enduring Economic Impact of the Philippines’ 1980s Crisis,” the paper recently got published in the journal Review of Development Economics. Our goal was to quantify the lasting impact of the full-blown debt crisis caused by the Marcos dictatorship. If you didn’t know yet, this debt crisis paved the way for a full-blown economic crisis — the worst in the postwar era, even surpassing the more recent COVID-19 crisis. The Marcosian debt crisis was quite distinct from the subsequent economic crisis. The debt crisis came from the fact that Ferdinand E. Marcos was a glutton for external debt: from 1965 (the first year he was ever elected president) all the way up to 1985 (his last full year in office), the Philippines racked up $25.45 billion in external debt. That’s an astonishing amount of money, needless to say. And much of it went to the infrastructure projects of the dictatorship (overdesigned and corrupted, much like the modus in the current flood-control brouhaha) as well as government corporations and equity infusions in cronies’ businesses. Debt accumulation was so unsustainable that we reached a tipping point in 1983. The economic managers then declared a “debt moratorium,” signaling to our creditors we can no longer pay our debts. Much like an insolvent debtor who loses face with their creditor, this event left a black mark on our record. Nobody wanted to touch us with a ten-foot pole, and yet we still had to negotiate a way to repay our massive outstanding debt. [ANALYSIS] Marcos debt: Ano ang katotohanan? In contrast to the debt crisis, the economic crisis in 1984–1985 was largely the result of the painful remedies we had to take to fix the economy. Our only lifeline was the International Monetary Fund, but they wouldn’t give us much-needed dollars unless the Marcos dictatorship fixed some parts of the economy that up to that point had been badly managed. For instance, we had to finally let go of the unsustainably strong peso and let the peso-dollar exchange rate be determined by market forces. This led to a severe depreciation of the peso that led to much more expensive imports and an astonishingly high average inflation rate of 50% in 1984. To combat this, the old Central Bank had to issue so-called “Jobo bills,” named after former governor Jobo Fernandez. These were short-term, high-yield debt instruments with flexible interest rates, that aimed to pull money out of circulation and attract investments here rather than have them flee abroad. But this move ended up raising interest rates across the economy(adjusted for inflation), and this choked off borrowing in the private sector — hence, the economic crisis that resulted from the debt crisis. I have more of the juicy details in my 2023 book, False Nostalgia. This brings us back to the journal paper. How did Noel de Dios and I quantify exactly the long-term impact of the debt crisis? Crucial here is the observation that the debt crisis of the Philippines in the 1980s was unique in this part of Asia. While other countries also faced the spike of interest rates globally in the 1980s, none suffered a full-blown debt crisis. This suggests that the policies of Marcos made all the difference. We used a quantitative technique called “synthetic control method,” which allowed us to ask: What would have happened to the Philippine economy had the crisis never occurred? Think of it as creating a hypothetical Philippines (or more accurately counterfactual Philippines). In pop culture, think of the Marvel multiverse where things would have been different from the main (canonical) storyline. What if Captain America was not Steve Rogers but Peggy Carter? What if the members of the Avengers were killed before they famously assembled? Applied here, what would the Philippines have looked like if it did not suffer a debt crisis in the 1980s? We were able to do this quantitatively by piecing together the characteristics of nearby economies like Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia which did not experience a similar debt crisis back then. Using this technique, we created the economic trajectory of this “synthetic Philippines” (the technical term), and compared that against the trajectory of the actual Philippines, the one that really existed. The crux of the paper is summarized by the graph below. Note that until the early 1980s, there’s practically no difference between synthetic and actual Philippines. But look how drastically their paths diverged since then, and how wide the gap has grown in the subsequent decades. By 2019, the synthetic Philippines had a GDP about 130% higher than the actual one. On average, from 1981 to 2019, the synthetic Philippines’ economy was more than double the size of what we actually had. In short: the crisis didn’t just cause a short recession. It permanently lowered our growth trajectory. We ran a bunch of tests to check if the method would produce false alarms, but they didn’t. The divergence decidedly happened in the 1980s, reinforcing the idea that it was a historic and decisive turning point for our economy. Fast-forward to 2025, why does this empirical result matter? Apart from the fact that we’re living under the rule of yet another Marcos in Malacañang, red flags are starting to reemerge where our debt is concerned. Sure, we’re still far from a debt crisis. But the debt-GDP ratio is inching up rather than down, and the most recent data says it’s at 63.1% (I’d be really worried if it exceeded 70%). And how much of that debt was accumulated because of overdesigned and corrupted public works projects like for flood control and road networks? Luckily, there are no indications that our dollar supplies are going to get depleted or that we’ll have to declare a debt moratorium. In many ways, the economy inherited by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is miles away from the one that was mangled by his father. But still, the journal paper shows that the Philippines today could be a lot richer had it not been for his father’s historic pillaging and mismanagement of our economy. We could be as rich as (or even richer) than Malaysia or Thailand, some of the region’s leaders. Above all, our paper is a stark reminder that we are now paying the price of massive corruption and mismanagement almost half a century ago. Amid the flood control scandal, if we also let massive corruption go unnoticed and unpunished, we’re likewise putting a huge burden on our children and grandchildren for decades to come.

"BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – SM Prime Holdings Incorporated (SMPH) has withdrawn its proposal to redevelop the Baguio City public market, the city government announced on Saturday, January 3. Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong also confirmed the withdrawal to Rappler in a phone interview, saying he was formally informed of the decision through a letter sent to his office. Details of the withdrawal and its implications for the city’s market rehabilitation plans have yet to be made public. According to a source familiar with the matter, the company was “dismayed over the lies and inaccuracies being circulated,” which it said had negatively affected its corporate image. Part of a December 19, 2025 letter sent to Magalong by SM Prime Holdings showed that the firm decided to withdraw “since it appears that Baguio City, the executive and legislative branches, the BCPM vendors, and other stakeholders in the project have several matters to settle before the project may be undertaken.” The Baguio City government first awarded the project to SMPH in 2020 when the Sy-led developer submitted an unsolicited proposal for the redevelopment. SMPH’s P5.4-billion proposal would include the construction of a seven-storey building and a parking lot that can accommodate around 1,900 vehicles. (READ: Robinsons, SM Prime present plans to redevelop Baguio market) But concerned residents and stakeholders opposed the proposed redevelopment, describing the move as part of the city government’s “blind drive” to privatize public infrastructure and prioritize corporate interests above constituents’ welfare. Vendors also voiced concerns that the redevelopment could negatively impact their livelihoods. The Baguio City Council was initially given until Saturday, January 10, to act on the proposed market development plan.

"MANILA, Philippines – The bloody war on drugs of former president Rodrigo Duterte did not only leave a massive death toll, but impacted the lives of tens of thousands of Filipinos who were jailed over flimsy drug charges. The drug suspects came in droves from 2016 to 2022, and pushed the already-crowded jails to their breaking point, breaching 100,000 in the incarcerated population. The result: drug suspects waiting for months for their day in court, and other detainees caught in the limbo of clogged court dockets. Watch this Rappler documentary by Lian Buan and Patrick Cruz.

"Who constructed the flood control projects that should have prevented the deaths caused by Typhoon Tino? The deadliest storm to hit the country this year, Tino and the destruction it left in its wake have sparked even more public outrage over the flood control controversy that first erupted earlier in July. Now, people are asking: Who should be held accountable? The government, at both the national and local levels, has pointed to the doubtful quality of flood control projects in the area. Here are the top flood control contractors of provinces where Tino caused the most deaths. Cebu province ranks second for most flood control projects and highest total cost of projects from 2022 to 2025. This is despite not being among the top 10 most flood-prone provinces in the country. But when Tino hit, it showed that the number and cost of these flood control projects did not equate to safety for the province. Scores of people still died, especially in the towns of Liloan, Compostela, Cebu City, Mandaue City, Danao City, Balamban, and Talisay City. So, since 2022, who built the flood control projects in these areas? In Liloan, where Tino claimed the most lives, Discaya-linked firms, in partnership with MC Geometric Proportions Inc., secured the highest total cost of contracts. These projects were supposed to prevent the Cotcot River from overflowing and flooding the surrounding land. But the waters still rose above the river’s banks, submerging the communities living downstream, as shown in a simulation released by the Cebu Provincial Capitol. Province-wide, QM Builders and Quirante Construction took the biggest slice of projects overall. Most of their projects were built to control the Mananga River in Talisay City, but a Sunstar report found that the shanties under and on the sides of the Mananga Bridge were still destroyed by the strong current. QM Builders is owned by Allan Quirante, who famously flip-flopped during a Senate probe into his company’s projects. Quirante Construction is led by Jonathan Quirante, and sources who requested anonymity told Rappler that Jonathan is Allan’s nephew. (READ: Dumanjug’s Quirante clan took nearly 1 of 4 flood control projects in Cebu) Negros Island is another area where Tino caused grave destruction, especially in Negros Occidental. From 2022 to 2025, ₱9.5 billion-worth of flood control projects were built in the area — though they failed to stop the recent typhoon from claiming several lives in the province. The Camansi and Binalbagan Rivers are located in the towns of La Castellana and Hinigaran, respectively. River control projects supposed to keep these bodies of water at bay were built by the country’s top flood control contractor: Legacy Construction Corporation. The firm is owned by Alex Abelido, who is also a prominent figure in Negros Occidental. Rappler had previously reported on his company’s flood control projects being flooded back in July. (READ: Most Negros Occidental projects of Marcos-listed top contractor flooded in July) Another report by Rappler in August found that Legacy Construction Corporation had previously received poor and unsatisfactory ratings from the Constructors’ Performance Evaluation System for road widening and drainage projects in 2020. On the other side of the island, Canlaon City in Negros Oriental was also among the hardest hit by Typhoon Tino. Data show that only one flood control project was built in the city from 2022 to 2025: a box culvert along the Vallehermoso-Canlaon City-La Castellana road constructed by Rekina Construction Services. The town had already been grappling with repeated activity from nearby Kanlaon Volcano when the typhoon struck. Before Tino made landfall, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) had already issued a warning for lahar and sediment flows. – Rappler.com",True,true,LIST: Top flood control contractors in Visayas towns where Tino was deadliest,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/visayas/list-top-flood-control-contractors-towns-typhoon-tino-deadliest/,Rappler
"NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – The millgate price of locally produced sugar dropped to an average of P2,200 per 50-kilogram bag on Thursday, October 9, sending shockwaves among sugar industry players in the Negros Island Region (NIR). The current price, nearly P300 below the P2,500 standard cost of production, has angered sugar planters who demanded an immediate explanation from the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) on why it happened barely a month after the start of the milling season. SRA Administrator Pablo Luis Azcona has yet to issue a statement as of Friday, October 10. Linley Retirado, president of the Lucio Tan-led Victorias Milling Company (VMC), Asia’s biggest sugar refinery, told Rappler that their bidding price as of Thursday stood at P2,260 per LKG. The Jose Mari Chan-owned Binalbagan-Isabela Sugar Company Incorporated (BISCOM) offered the same rate. Sagay City’s Lopez Sugar Central posted a bidding price of P2,257 per LKG, while Universal Robina Corporation’s (URC) sugar mills in Kabankalan and La Carlota offered P2,270 and P2,251.72 per LKG, respectively, according to Ang Mangunguma, a group of agrarian reform beneficiaries turned sugar planters in Negros Occidental. Calling the drop “unacceptable,” Negros Occidental 5th District Representative Emilio Bernardino Yulo III said he will bring the issue to Congress next week. “This is unacceptable. We need an explanation from SRA on why this happened,” Yulo, a former SRA board member, told Rappler on Friday, October 10. He said it was the SRA’s mandate to maintain a balance between sugar producers and consumers, adding that allowing prices to fall below the cost of production “is a no-no.” Himamaylan City Vice Mayor Justin Silos Gatuslao, also a sugar planter, lamented the situation, saying he pitied small producers struggling with fertilizer prices averaging P1,800 to P2,000 per bag. He said he will push for a resolution next week at the city council of Himamaylan asking the national government to intervene, calling the matter “concerning” and “urgent.” Wennie Sancho, secretary-general of the General Alliance of Workers Association (GAWA), blamed the crisis on sugar importation. “This is already a recurring problem in the industry with sugar importation as always the culprit,” Sancho said. He argued that local prices would not fall below production cost “if there are no imported supplies flooding the local markets right now.” “It’s obvious. Again, somebody is playing the sugar industry to the expense of ordinary laborers,” Sancho said. On Tuesday, October 7, the National Federation of Sugar Planters (NFSP) warned that importation under Sugar Order No. 8, series of 2024–2025, could depress prices. NFSP president Enrique Rojas said excessive importation would hurt the industry early in the milling season. “In fact, last week, we already communicated with the SRA as to our concerns regarding the excessive sugar importation. We agreed to an initial importation of 150,000 metric tons, but more than such volume have already entered the country as of September 14,” Rojas said. “Additional importation, therefore, is ‘suicidal’ to the sugar industry.” Sancho warned that the price slump could trigger job cuts in Negros haciendas, dimming hopes for a “merry Christmas” among sugar workers and their families as planters reduce labor costs. The NIR has around 150,000 hacienda laborers, excluding hundreds of thousands of agrarian reform beneficiaries who have become small sugar planters, Sancho said. – Rappler.com",True,true,Negros sugar planters alarmed as millgate prices plunge below production cost,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/visayas/negros-occidental-sugar-planters-alarmed-millgate-prices-plunge-october-10-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines imported a total of 3.37 million metric tons (MT) of rice in 2025, down 30% from 2024’s 4.8 million MT, according to latest data from the Bureau of Plant Industry. The dip was the result of the government’s four-month suspension on rice imports beginning September until end of the year, resorted to supposedly protect local farmers selling palay at peak harvest season. Department of Agriculture spokesman Arnel de Mesa said Thursday, January 8, that the import suspension “proved that even without imported rice, there was no swift increase [in prices].” “What this means is the rice that enters the country is beyond what we need,” De Mesa said in a mix of Filipino and English. In December, the country imported just 27,000 MT of rice, the lowest volume in 2025, compared with 505,000 MT in May, the year’s peak. The country resumed rice importations January 2026 and has imposed a flexible tariff scheme ranging from 15% to 35%. According to Executive Order No. 105, there will be an increase in rice import duty by five percentage points per five percent decrease in international rice prices. In 2024, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. lowered rice tariffs from 35% to 15% to tame prices. – Rappler.com",True,true,Rice imports down to 3.37 million MT in 2025,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/rice-imports-down-2025/,Rappler
"The lawmakers’ goal was to break Royina Garma. It took a subpoena, hours and hours of interpellations, and detention before she finally cracked. On Friday, October 10, Garma dropped a bombshell testimony — the gravest allegation against former president Rodrigo Duterte in so far as the quad committee conducting marathon hearings is concerned. Garma, who’s “very close” to Duterte, pinned him as the alleged mastermind of the bloody drug war that killed 30,000, going by the count of human rights advocates. In tears, Garma read her affidavit, narrating her knowledge about Duterte’s drug war. In May 2016, Garma said the then president-elect called her at 5 am, instructing her to meet him at his residence in Doña Luisa, Davao City. They had a meeting and Duterte instructed her to find a Philippine National Police (PNP) officer or an Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) operative capable of implementing on a national scale the war on drugs that was executed in his home turf. At first, Garma could not think of anyone that met Duterte’s criteria, until she remembered Edilberto Leonardo, her upperclassman from the PNP Academy — he was with the PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) and was an INC member. Garma mentioned Leonardo to Duterte, and on the same day, Senator Bong Go’s former Palace aide, Irmina “Muking” Espino, allegedly contacted Garma and requested Leonardo’s personal details. Through her former partner, cop Arthur Narsolis, Garma said she learned that Leonardo had been summoned by Duterte. Later, Garma said she was told by Leonardo that “he had prepared a proposal, routed through Bong Go, outlining the task force’s operations, which would encompass Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.” In other words, it would appear that based on Garma’s affidavit, Duterte tasked Leonardo, a member of PNPA Batch 1996, to implement a drug war plan, of which he (Leonardo) became head strategist. In her affidavit, Garma detailed how Duterte and Leonardo worked together to create the national anti-drug campaign. She said the plan was patterned after the “Davao model” that saw killings allegedly rewarded by Duterte. According to Garma, Duterte instructed Leonardo to organize a task force similar to the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF) to implement the campaign. The Davao Death Squad (DDS), according to the affidavit of DDS whistleblower Arturo Lascañas, was conceptualized in 1988, when Duterte was the mayor; it was known as an “anti-crime task force.” The task force eventually became the PAOCTF, which had a satellite office in Davao City headed by former PNP chief-turned-Senator Ronald dela Rosa. “Garma confirmed our belief from the very start that the drug war just replicated the DDS system that existed in Davao before 2016,” former senator Leila de Lima told Rappler. De Lima probed the killings under Duterte when she was Commission on Human Rights (CHR) chairperson. Garma, however, clarified that the creation of the task force did not push through. Instead, the police was mobilized for the national anti-drug campaign. She explained that the PNP CIDG Davao Region became the focal point of the operation. This makes sense as Leonardo, who was assigned to Manila at the time, was appointed Davao Region CIDG chief in June 2016 — the same month Duterte took the helm in Malacañang. “Leonardo conducted briefings for all PDEA (Philippine Drug Enforcement Group), IG (intelligence groups), Regional Directors, and PNP chiefs regarding operations,” Garma said in her affidavit. In the first three months of Leonardo’s assignment, Garma said she facilitated the meetings between him and Go, after which the two later established their direct communication. Garma said she was also informed by Leonardo that he picked “trusted personnel” to join the team. These included Lester Berganio, Rommel Bactat, Rodel Cerbo, Michael Palma, and Peter Parungo. Bactat, Cerbo, and Palma were dismissed cops, according to Garma. Parungo, meanwhile, was a former CIDG detainee accused of rape, while Berganio was a private citizen. Their assignments, according to Garma, who saw how they “operated,” were as follows: “Leonardo had the final authority to determine who would be included on the list of drug personalities and to classify their threat levels, as well as the discretion to remove individuals from the list,” Garma added. Go was involved in the operation as he was the one who did a weekly report and processed the requests for refunds under the system, according to Garma. Leonardo also reported all killings during police operations to Go. Garma also clarified that the quota system was not part of the original instruction, but became discretionary on the part of regional chiefs. Police could also volunteer to be part of the operation, according to Garma. The cops presented themselves if they were confident they coould get “the big fish in the area.” Among these volunteers, according to Garma, was Police Colonel Marvin Marcos, who led the operation inside the jail that killed Albuera, Leyte mayor Rolando Espinosa. Marcos confirmed volunteering but only for a position, and not to deliver kills in exchange for a reward. Rappler has reached out to Dela Rosa and Go for more recent comments. The two, who are now senators, had already denied Garma’s allegations earlier. Under the Davao template, there were at least three levels in the payment system: Kabataan Representative Raoul Manuel inquired about the payment per type of target, but Garma said she only knew of the payments’ range. “There were certain amounts given from what I understand, starting P20,000 to P1 million, but I am not familiar with the bracketing,” Garma explained in a mix of Filipino and English, adding that the P20,000-reward could possibly be allotted for street-level drug suspects since they were at the lowest “level.” The affidavit said rewards were given only for killings. Arrests merited from Leonardo only a COPLAN fund and a refund of the team’s operating expenses. All the money, according to Garma, were processed through Parungo’s bank accounts. Garma, in the hearing, also presented a matrix that showed Leonardo at the heart of the campaign. The then-CIDG Davao Region chief was involved both in the operations and reward system. The diagram also showed the PNP’s regional special operations groups, including the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. Garma said she would later learn that it was Muking Espino who sent the reward money for distribution to operatives. Garma’s testimony is an important piece of the puzzle in the probe into drug war killings. The new affidavit indirectly confirmed the systemic killings in Davao City. According to De Lima, among the vital points mentioned by Garma in her affidavit was Go’s alleged involvement in the so-called “national death squad” (NDS), referring to those involved in the drug war killings implemented nationwide. “Not once was Bong Go suspected to have an active role in the DDS. It was always Buenaventura and Lascañas then Duterte. But in the NDS, it appears that Leonardo and the “special task force” reported directly to Bong Go. That is one significant information that is not in the CHR findings due to lack of confirmation,” De Lima said. Garma’s revelations did not only reveal how Duterte came up with the drug war, but also showed that Leonardo was the bigger fish compared to her. In the Lascañas affidavit, Leonardo was only named as an alleged member, but did not include any specific detail about the supposed operation that Leonardo had joined. Garma’s affidavit finally showed the extent of Leonardo’s involvement in the drug war. Garma also corroborated the earlier statement of former drug war poster boy, Police Lieutenant Colonel Jovie Espenido, about the campaign having a reward system. Espenido claimed the rewards came from local government units, from the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office’s (PCSO’s) Small Town Lottery, and even from Philippine offshore gaming operators, and intelligence funds. (READ: ‘PNP is biggest crime group,’ says police colonel) However, Garma denied that the PCSO, which she once led, provided funds for the drug war’s reward system. Garma’s testimony also complemented Lascañas affidavit as the latter only included the alleged killings when Duterte was still mayor up to the time before he ran for president. The new affidavit shows the inception of the drug war when Duterte was already elected president and how the campaign was launched and operated. Can Garma’s testimony be used by the International Criminal Court that is conducting its own investigation into the drug war killings? For Kristina Conti of the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers and an ICC-accredited assistant to counsel, Garma can be tapped by the international court as witness and could further qualify as an insider witness during the trial. “Garma’s statement clearly identifies key actors in a policy that resulted in crimes against humanity. She brings critical evidence long sought by the ICC that establishes a systematic pattern to the ‘war on drugs,’ and connects the real, responsible perpetrators to the killings committed on the ground,” Conti told Rappler. Garma said no one coerced her to pin Duterte, saying that she realized the need to speak up after much reflection: “I made some reflections and I have to go back sa values na lagi kong sinasabi (that I always say)…. Always [tell] the truth because the truth will set you free.” As of now, Garma said she does not face any threats for executing her affidavit, but she acknowledged the influence and power of the people she implicated in the drug war. But despite all these, there’s a glaring detail in Garma’s revelation. In the hearing, she distanced herself from all the allegations, despite knowing the vital details of the drug war. Garma claimed that she refused to be part of the task force and did not know of any specific operation where she was ordered by a higher-up to kill. While she confirmed her knowledge of the killings and the reward system, Garma said she learned about the operations only from Leonardo. Her revelations did not erase the fact that she remains implicated in other alleged crimes, besides the bloody drug war. Garma is tagged in the killings of three Chinese drug lords in Davao in 2016, along with other officials like Duterte and Leonardo. She has also been implicated in the ambush of PCSO board secretary Wesley Barayuga, who was assassinated in 2020. On Friday, Garma said she received information about Barayuga’s alleged involvement in illegal drugs years ago and just relayed this to authorities for verification. She maintained that she did not have any beef with the slain PCSO official. An informed source, however, earlier told Rappler that there was an issue inside the PCSO involving both officials when they were still in the same agency. Garma was also previously questioned over her appointment to the PCSO and was accused of collecting millions of pesos from online gambling payola by former Cebu City mayor Tommy Osmeña. Garma was also the Cebu City police chief when the city became a hot spot of drug war killings. “Her testimony notwithstanding, Garma should be taken to account under domestic laws. Her actions in Cebu and as PCSO [general manager] should be investigated and prosecuted. She obviously needs to be more forthcoming with information about how the violence was carried out and who was paid with how much,” Human Rights Watch senior researcher Carlos Conde said. Quad committee co-chairperson Bienvenido Abante said Leonardo has already given feelers about giving his testimony. If this pushes through, people should await whether Leonardo’s testimony will contradict or corroborate Garma’s allegations against Duterte. But now that Garma has already spoken up, the former chief executive has been directly implicated, courtesy of the cop who was once “very close” to him. – Rappler.com *Some quotes were translated into English for brevity",True,true,How Duterte’s 5 am call to Garma starts a nationwide drug war,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/how-duterte-planned-drug-war-royina-garma-affidavit/,Rappler
"Strong AI demand helped power Alphabet’s financial results, as both the core advertising and cloud computing businesses of the Google parent beat revenue expectations. Despite whispers of concerns over a developing AI bubble, the search giant boosted its projected capital expenditures for the year to between $91 billion and $93 billion. “We are investing to meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities across the company,” CEO Sundar Pichai said in Alphabet’s earnings release. Alphabet, which spent $52.5 billion in 2024, had already shocked Wall Street twice this year with its aggressive spending ambitions, first declaring a $75 billion outlay in February, and then boosting the projection to $85 billion in July. Shares of the company rose 6% in extended trading. The company reported total revenue of $102.35 billion for the quarter, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $99.89 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Adjusted profit per share of $3.10 beat estimates of $2.26. Google Cloud’s 34% revenue growth helped it to remain as one of Alphabet’s fastest-growing segments as it benefitted from surging enterprise demand for AI-powered infrastructure and data analytics services. The unit posted revenue of $15.16 billion, topping estimates of $14.72 billion. The performance was boosted by burgeoning enterprise demand for its AI infrastructure, even as returns for businesses adopting the technology remain uncertain. That is evidenced by Google Cloud’s backlog of non-recognized sales contracts, which grew to $155 billion, according to Pichai. In July, Alphabet said the backlog had reached $106 billion. The unit continues to close the gap with larger rivals Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, aided by strong take-up of Vertex AI and its custom AI chips called Tensor Processing Units. Competition in the broader AI and cloud market is intensifying, with rivals aggressively cutting prices and introducing new generative-AI capabilities. Revenue from Google’s advertising business rose 12.6% to $74.18 billion, well above estimates of $71.79 billion, allaying fears of some investors and indicating that the digital ad market has remained robust in the face of economic uncertainty and intense competition. Alphabet’s advertising unit, which contributes the vast majority of the company’s revenue, has been competing in a crowded field of rivals vying for more ad dollars as lower interest rates are expected to lift the economy. “Continued strength in search is helping to dispel the negative sentiment surrounding AI’s potential impact on Google’s biggest businesses,” said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager at shareholder Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. However, analysts have pointed to cautious spending from advertisers in some sectors grappling with economic uncertainty due to pressures from tariff costs and a rapidly evolving global trading landscape. Still, Wall Street expects the company to benefit from advertisers moving away from experimental ad platforms like Snapchat and others. Last week, Microsoft and SoftBank Group-backed OpenAI unveiled Atlas, an AI-powered browser aimed at directly competing with Google’s core search engine and browser stack. The launch, as Reuters earlier reported, represents one of the most significant challenges to Google’s search dominance in years and will be a key focus for investors listening for management’s response to the rising competitive threat to its most lucrative business. Still, while the ChatGPT maker and other startups like Anthropic and Perplexity are introducing new AI-powered apps to consumers, Google’s search market share appears to be steadying. “AI Overviews and AI Mode are clearly resonating with users, helping to ease fears that Google’s core search business is under threat from generative AI,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Alphabet reported that its number of employees stood at roughly 190,000 at the end of September, up by more than 8,000 from the same period last year. Its rival Amazon said it will lay off 14,000 workers on Tuesday. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Alphabet hikes capex again after earnings beat on strong ad, cloud demand",https://www.rappler.com/technology/alphabet-earnings-release-october-2025/,Rappler
"The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has ordered a temporary suspension of its field audit operations nationwide, a directive formalized under Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 107-2025, issued on November 24, 2025. This move, initiated under the leadership of the new BIR Commissioner, Charlito Martin R. Mendoza, is an institutional response to concerns regarding the integrity and fairness of the tax audit process. Understanding this suspension and its implications is vital for maintaining proactive tax risk management. The primary objective of the audit suspension under RMC 107‑2025 is to enable the BIR to implement a more comprehensive internal review of its tax audit policies and procedures, strengthen internal safeguards, and ensure that the issuance of Letters of Authority (LOAs) and Mission Orders (MOs) follows the rule of law, advancing the protection of taxpayer rights. Unlike the annual “Stop Audit,” which was a fixed, short-term pause mostly affecting routine audits, the current suspension was implemented earlier, includes stronger internal controls, covers both new and ongoing audits, and will remain in effect until lifted by the Commissioner. It is crucial to note that RMC No. 107-2025 does not constitute a total freeze on all BIR examinations. The following critical and time-sensitive operations are explicitly excluded and will proceed: While the temporary suspension alleviates immediate audit pressure, the expectation is that the ensuing audit system will be more stringent and standardized. Therefore, businesses should use this period for critical internal preparation. The BIR’s directive presents an opportunity for the Bureau to implement procedural reforms and for taxpayers to reinforce their internal controls and compliance posture. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Ask the Tax Whiz] Temporary suspension of BIR audit: Are you affected?,https://www.rappler.com/business/ask-the-tax-whiz-things-to-know-temporary-suspension-bir-audit/,Rappler
"On November 11, 2025, the De La Salle University (DLSU) Ramon V. del Rosario College of Business (RVRCOB) was awarded 4 Palmes of Excellence at the Eduniversal World Convention hosted by the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Indore at the Indore Marriott Hotel. This puts the DLSU RVRCOB in the top 20% of 1,000 ranked business schools worldwide. Eduniversal recognized the college’s programs that combine academic rigor with real-world business experience. The 4 Palmes recognize academic excellence and regional leadership through research, sustainability, and ethical business practices. By nurturing Lasallian business leaders who make a difference, RVRCOB advances global business education excellence. This award, though very much welcome, raises challenging questions for reflections. How does a school with international influence become a global force for good? The answer requires looking beyond our own achievements to learn from institutions that have wrestled with this question too. The convention, with the theme “Bridging Purpose and Performance: Business Education as a Force for Good,” opened with Professor Himanshu Rai’s remarks and keynote. As the director of IIM Indore, he explained the role of Indore and his business school in contributing to India’s nation-building efforts. His institution holds Triple Crown accreditation, ranks among the world’s top 1% of business schools, and sits on a 193-acre campus, and plays a vital role in the development of Indore. With the efforts of the local government, the school, and the citizens, Indore has been recognized as the India’s cleanest city for seven consecutive years. Moving to his keynote, Rai chose to ground ethical leadership lessons on Vedic wisdom and ancient Sanskrit texts. Rai connected Vedic wisdom to concrete leadership failures he’d witnessed: leaders who lost themselves in performance metrics, who deflected accountability when decisions went wrong, who operated below their capacity because they feared failure more than they valued excellence. Rai calls IIM Indore as “ancient yet agile.” The phrase captures something we need to understand. The school doesn’t treat its cultural heritage as decoration or as separate from “real” business education. Indian wisdom isn’t an elective. It’s the foundation that shapes how they think about leadership, how they structure experiential learning programs, and how they evaluate what counts as success. The Vedas and the Indian heritage are taught as business education, not alongside it. The case of IIM Indore is fascinating in its paradox: it honors its tradition, yet it is considered a top global school of tomorrow. How can Filipino business schools learn from this example? At RVRCOB, we have something similar: our Lasallian tradition and our Filipino values. But do we teach them as business education or merely adjacent to it? Context-wise, the Philippines and India share characteristics. Large populations, rapid growth, collectivist cultures, family business dominance. Colonial histories creating tension between indigenous wisdom and imported models. What if Philippine business schools integrate our respective values with our cultural heritage? What if RVRCOB combines Filipino concepts with Lasallian pedagogical discipline? Filipino psychology and philosophy provide rich cultural resources. The most relevant to management, I think, are the Filipino constructs I would label as “DKL” (in part because it can be read as “dakila”) — diwa, kapwa, and loob. Loob represents the inner self, the seat of volition and authentic conviction. Kapwa captures our relational nature, the recognition that self and other are fundamentally interconnected. Diwa points toward collective consciousness, the spirit that animates groups and organizations. Similar to how Rai drew from the wisdom of the Vedas, DKL describes how Filipinos actually experience and navigate the world. A manager who cultivates loob develops genuine conviction rather than performing what they think leadership should look like. A leader who practices kapwa builds organizations where people matter as people, not as human resources. An institution animated by diwa serves purposes that transcend narrow institutional interests. DLSU’s Lasallian Reflection Framework already provides a structured approach to values-based practice through Masid-Danas (See-Experience), Suri-Nilay (Analysis-Reflection), and Taya-Kilos (Commitment-Action). These aren’t just steps in a process. Masid-Danas means being mapagpansin, genuinely attentive to what’s actually happening, not what theories predict. Suri-nilay goes deeper than standard analysis, malalim (deep), seeking integrated understanding by engaging intellect and intuition together, the capacity to grasp situations holistically, to see patterns that pure logic might miss, to develop insights then validate them iteratively. Taya-kilos is where discernment becomes action, may pananagutan, completely accountable and responsible, not action for its own sake but movement that flows from genuine understanding. The path forward requires three shifts. First, Philippine business schools need to stop treating Filipino values as supplementary to “real” business education. They are our foundations for thinking about management, leadership, and organizational purpose. Second, we need to develop pedagogical approaches that genuinely integrate these values rather than just mentioning them. IIM Indore structures entire programs around their heritage, from their Rural Engagement Program to their Himalayan Outbound Program to their workshops on Mithila traditional art forms. What would Filipino business education look like if we took our own wisdom traditions that seriously? Third, we need to root ourselves more deeply in Philippine social realities. Business education becomes a force for good when business schools become genuine partners in addressing the specific challenges facing Philippine society. RVRCOB’s 4 Palmes recognition tells us that Philippine business schools are worth recognizing globally. IIM Indore shows us one possibility: a business school that draws strength from its cultural context while meeting global standards. Our international peers are calling for us. The global picture needs the colors only we Filipinos can add. – Rappler.com Patrick Adriel H.

The agribusiness firm’s president and chief executive officer Kenneth Cheng said on Monday, October 13, that the company does not intend to go public any time soon, and instead, focus on strengthening its domestic supply chain. “Right now we’re investing for the future. We are not only investing in new farms, we’re also investing in new plants,” he explained. Cheng did not disclose the exact figure of Bounty Fresh’s capital expenditures (capex) for the year, but he noted that the firm is allocating around half of its capex to expansion. This includes the construction of new facilities such as farms and processing plants. Plans for expansion come as consultancy firm GIRA estimates that poultry consumption in the Philippines will grow 500,000 tons every five years. This translates to a poultry consumption of 4.5 million tons by 2050, double the current 2 million tons. “Filipinos are going to eat chicken, whether the local farmers produce them or not. If we don’t produce them, it will be coming in by importation. And so this is an opportunity for the local poultry farmer, but it’s also a challenge,” Cheng said. In order to keep up with growing poultry demand, Bounty Fresh aims to sustainably strengthen its supply chain by boosting production, distribution and market reach to balance growth with demand. Cheng noted that one of the obstacles to achieving this is the limited workforce in agriculture as the youth pursue other fields. He also stressed the need to invest in the agricultural sector’s workforce to develop stockmanship and create a career pipeline that younger generations can build a career out of. The Bounty Fresh chief also underscored the need to invest in biosecurity to help the sector keep pace with the demand. Bounty Fresh is the Philippines’ second largest poultry integrator. The company estimates that it contributes around a quarter of the country’s total poultry production. Cheng added that that the Inoza Group’s recent acquisition of the Bistro Group will help integrate Bounty Fresh’s chicken business into the restaurants. Inoza Holdings of Bounty Fresh chairman Tennyson Chen acquired 22% of the Bistro Group from tycoon Andres Soriano III’s A. Soriano Corporation for P1.9 billion on October 2. – Rappler.com",True,true,Bounty Fresh aims to strengthen operations amid growing appetite for poultry,https://www.rappler.com/business/bounty-fresh-strengthen-operations-poultry-consumption-growth-october-2025/,Rappler
"CEBU, Philippines — At a funeral home in Liloan, Cebu, 31-year-old Krizza Espra searches for clothes, something decent for her children to wear in their coffins. Her arms bore visible scratches. Her face was blank, eyes distant, as if her body was there but her mind was still caught in the flood that took everything from her. Krizza lost her entire family when floodwaters swept through her sister’s home in Barangay Tamiao, Compostela, Cebu, during the onslaught of Typhoon Tino (Kalmaegi) on Tuesday morning, November 4. Originally from Barangay Cotcot, the family thought they would be safer staying in her sister’s house. “Pumunta kami doon kasi noong Odette, wala kaming tubig sa Cotcot,” she said in a trembling voice. (We went there because when Typhoon Odette struck, we had no water in Cotcot.) At around 6:30 am, floodwaters rapidly rose, forcing them onto the roof. Moments later, the structure gave way. “Magkasama kami sa bubong. Gumuho yung bubong, nahulog kami, nalalag kami,” Krizza recalled. “Apat lang kami naka-survive.” (We were all together on the roof. Then it collapsed, and we fell. Only four of us survived.) She lost nearly her entire family: her husband James Espra, 29, their children Sebastian James, 8; Alessia Isabelle, 4; and Kyle Stefan, 1; her parents Alice, 73, and Samuel Bugtai, 82; a nephew, two young cousins, and her aunt. Only four members of the extended family survived: Krizza, her cousin’s husband, her brother, and her brother’s wife. Her mother, aunt, and two children of her cousin, ages three months and three years, are still missing. “Apat pa yung missing sa amin,” she said. “Sana may tumulong para mapabilis yung pangahanap bago bumaho yung mga bangkay nila at mga agnas, makilala man lang namin, makuha sila.” (Four of our members are missing. I hope we can get some help to find and identify them before the bodies decompose.)

"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine economy grew just 4% in the third quarter of 2025 as the flood control scandal dampened investor and consumer confidence, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Friday, November 7. The latest gross domestic product (GDP) print is slower than the second quarter’s 5.5% growth rate, and places the country’s average economic growth for the year so far at just 5%. The Marcos administration aims to grow the economy by 5.5% to 6.5% in 2025. The GDP print is also much lower than analysts’ expectations of around 5.3%. It marks the Philippine economy’s slowest growth since the contraction in the first quarter of 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government infrastructure spending plunged to a 14-year low of -26.2% growth amid stricter validation measures for the Department of Public Works and Highways’ projects, as well as delayed billings and disbursements for government works. These measures were implemented in light of the government’s ongoing probe into anomalous flood control projects. Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan also noted that the flood control scandal affected consumer confidence, as households postponed their purchases of durable goods. Household spending grew by just 0.5% in the third quarter. On the production side, all three major industries posted growth in the third quarter. The agriculture sector (2.8% growth) rebounded from last year’s contraction (-2.7%), but growth in industry (0.7%) and services (5.5%) slowed from the same quarter in 2024. Balisacan admitted that to meet the government’s target growth range, the economy will have to grow by around 6.8% in the fourth quarter. “Given the shocks that are happening at the moment and are expected to linger in the remaining weeks and before the year ends, that’s quite challenging,” he said. Balisacan noted that the last time public construction spending contracted by over 20% was in 2011 amid the late former president Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III’s crackdown on corruption. Because of the loss of consumer and investor confidence, Balisacan vowed to implement “strategic interventions” to bolster trust and accelerate economic growth. These include fast-tracking social protection for vulnerable Filipinos and pursuing long-term governance reforms such as proposed amendments to the bank secrecy law. He also hopes that the government can begin disbursing funds for projects that are not tainted with corruption. “Those projects that were intended for 2025 that were already completed and are not involved with any of those red flags, they should be paid so that the resources, the funds will recirculate in the economy and create other opportunities, more opportunities,” he said. The country’s chief economist also noted that the government is underspending in key priority areas despite an increase in funding for infrastructure over the years. “The productive capacity that we had wanted to happen was muted by all this corruption because the investment in infrastructure that we are trying to ramp up is supposed to enhance the capacity of the economy to produce more, to employ more, to generate higher quality jobs,” Balisacan explained. Balisacan underscored the importance of not just merely increasing infrastructure spending, but improving the quality of spending as well. This means ensuring that public funds are spent on high-quality projects that will boost economic growth, even if it means working with a smaller budget. “So what I think lagged behind and we should have worked on harder are the governance and institutional mechanisms that would allow us to accommodate such kind of spending. And this is…I think an important lesson — that we did not focus much on equally important areas of good economic management, and it is the ecosystem that would allow us to ensure that there is consistency between policy design and implementation and outcomes,” he said. – Rappler.com",True,true,Corruption woes drag Philippines’ economic growth to 4-year low in Q3 2025,https://www.rappler.com/business/gross-domestic-product-philippines-q3-2025/,Rappler
"Newly surfaced records obtained by Vantage Point expose how GSIS trustees, Evelina Escudero, Merceditas Gutierrez and Rita Riddle, helped usher in a dubious ₱2-billion IT deal with DBP Data Center Inc. (DCI) — a firm whose own executives later admitted to have lacked the capability in building the public sector’s social insurance institution’s core systems. What began as a push for “modernization” now reeks of impropriety and influence-peddling within a pension fund in which these ladies claim to have been mismanaged. When guardians of the public trust start behaving like brokers, institutions crumble from within. The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), already bruised by allegations of governance lapses and flood-control controversies, now finds itself entangled in another scandal — this time involving a ₱2-billion computerization deal pushed by trustees Evelina Escudero and Rita Riddle and allegedly backed by Merceditas Gutierrez. Gutierrez and Riddle resigned from the GSIS board last month. What makes this case galling is not just the staggering amount or the timing — coming as GSIS struggles to rebuild credibility — but the audacity with which key trustees introduced and advanced a project pitched by a company that ultimately confessed it couldn’t deliver what it was promising. On September 2, 2025, representatives from DBP Data Center Incorporated (DCI) — Business Development Head Jose Enrique Singson, Project Lead Apolonia Salud Jr., and domain experts Ma. Isabel Domingo and Dennis Dizon — met with the GSIS Board of Trustees to present their information technology (IT) services. That meeting alone raised eyebrows. DCI was no mere vendor — it was a government-owned and -controlled corporation (GOCC) under the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). Yet its delegation was allowed to pitch directly to the GSIS board, a move that blurred procurement lines and created a cozy dynamic between trustees and a potential contractor. Just two weeks later, on September 15, 2025, during the Legal Oversight Committee meeting, trustees proposed that GSIS and DCI execute a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) — fast-tracked through a board referendum which bypassed a full deliberation. For an institution managing billions in pension assets, such haste is indefensible. The trustees weren’t merely entertaining a presentation; they were laying the groundwork for a partnership that would later balloon into a ₱2-billion IT “modernization” project. Thankfully, not everyone was asleep at the switch. Vantage Point learned that on September 29, 2025, GSIS President and General Manager Jose Arnulfo “Wick” Veloso intervened during the Risk Oversight Committee meeting, requesting that approval of the MOU be deferred. Veloso, who had not attended the earlier presentations, questioned why such a significant deal had progressed without his knowledge. He requested a direct meeting with DCI’s top executives — President and Chief Executive Officer Michielson Luakian and Chief Operating Officer Jose Carmelo Porciuncula — to better understand their proposal. The meeting was scheduled for October 9, 2025. What unfolded there should have killed the deal permanently. During that October meeting, DCI executives revealed more than they intended. They described their company as a “40-year-old startup” offering IT support and staff augmentation services to various government agencies and private clients. When asked if they developed the core systems of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), they admitted they did not — DBP handled its own IT infrastructure. DCI merely provided manpower support “when needed.” When pressed further about their readiness to take on GSIS’s modernization, DCI’s own president conceded that “GSIS is significantly more advanced in IT than most government-owned or -controlled corporations,” and that DCI “does not have the capability to undertake the development of GSIS’s core systems.” The clincher came when Luakian stated DCI would formally withdraw its interest to avoid further delays in GSIS’s internal plans. If this were a private-sector board, the next step would be an investigation into how such a weak proposal ever made it to board-level presentation. In GSIS, however, it became another footnote in a long saga of institutional decay. After the meeting, Veloso reportedly asked who had introduced DCI to GSIS. The answer came from Vice President and Chief Information Security/Data Protection Officer Jonathan Pineda: it was trustees Riddle and Escudero. It was later learned that the deal had the backing of Gutierrez. Pineda disclosed that during the September 2 Risk Oversight Committee meeting, Riddle and Escudero had suggested that GSIS’s IT systems be “reviewed and audited by DCI,” and that an MOU be signed to facilitate an “agency-to-agency procurement.” That phrase — agency-to-agency procurement — is key. Such arrangements between government entities are exempt from public bidding under Republic Act 9184, the Government Procurement Reform Act. In theory, agency-to-agency procurements promote efficiency. In practice, they create a loophole: a way to move massive sums without competitive scrutiny. It’s not modernization; it’s maneuvering. The revelations did not stop there. Upon background check, Vantage Point discovered that DCI President Luakian — the same man who had just admitted lack of IT expertise — was previously business development head of M.E. Sicat Construction Incorporated, a DPWH contractor involved in public works projects. So, the man behind a proposed ₱2-billion IT deal for GSIS came from the same world of construction contracting now tainted by flood-control scandals. To call that a conflict of interest would be an understatement — it is a revolving door between two sectors notorious for cost overruns and patronage politics. Trustees Riddle, Escudero, and Gutierrez appear to have facilitated, endorsed, or at best tolerated a process that flirted dangerously with impropriety. Gutierrez, who recently resigned from the GSIS board and carries her own history of ethical baggage as former Philippine justice secretary and Ombudsman — should have been the first to demand due diligence. Their actions betray a disturbing inversion of duty: trustees meant to guard public funds became the very conduits for questionable partnerships. At a time when GSIS is under intense scrutiny for investment losses — which the three ladies, along with other signatories, alleged procurement opacity — and political entanglements, the last thing the institution needs is another scandal cloaked in the language of “digital transformation.” The DCI episode is symptomatic of a larger sickness in public finance: the weaponization of “modernization.” Every time an agency is caught in a scandal, it announces a grand reform project — usually IT-related, often multimillion-peso, or in this case multibillion-peso, worth. These projects rarely fix the core problem. They merely digitize dysfunction. Without ethical leadership, every system — no matter how advanced — becomes another conduit for graft. What must happen now GSIS doesn’t need a ₱2-billion IT overhaul. It needs an ethical reboot. Until the board cleans its ranks, no system — digital or human — can restore the public’s trust. Escudero, Gutierrez, and Riddle’s fingerprints on the DCI affair show that the danger to GSIS is not technological inadequacy, but moral decay. When trustees act like sales agents and former contractors pose as technological innovators, modernization becomes just another scam in bureaucratic clothing. If GSIS cannot fix that, it won’t need a new system; it will need a rescue. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] The DCI-GSIS affair: A billion-peso blunder,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-dbp-dci-gsis-affair-billion-peso-blunder/,Rappler
"Executive Secretary Ralph Recto has declared in a statement that “better days are coming” for the Philippine economy. It arrives at a moment when President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s administration is eager to showcase its wins with inflation dropping to 1.5% in November — well below the government’s target band — while major credit rating agency S&P’s reaffirmation of the country’s BBB+ rating has given Malacañang a welcome seal of external validation. Recto frames these developments as evidence of a disciplined, more transparent governance culture under Marcos Jr., pointing to asset seizures, Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) freezes, and recovered kickbacks as signs that the state is finally cracking down on corruption. In his telling, low prices, a strong labor market, and a “disciplined” 2026 budget will pave the way for a stronger, more confident economy. But optimism must coexist with realism. Debt is rising faster than growth, the peso remains exposed to political shocks, and institutional credibility is still repairing itself after the turbulence of the past year. Whether the Philippines truly enters a “better, stronger” economic phase will depend, not on inflation numbers or international ratings, but on the country’s ability to confront the structural risks that soften the foundations beneath Recto’s upbeat narrative. Vantage Point does not dispute Recto’s optimistic claim. I concede that it is grounded in real macroeconomic gains, but it also sits atop a fiscal landscape that demands more caution than celebration. The same period that produced low inflation also produced a swelling national debt, which reached ₱17.56 trillion in October — a 9.62% increase from the previous year, and much faster than the economy’s own expansion. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth of roughly 5.2% cannot keep pace with the speed at which obligations are piling up, particularly as the peso softens from ₱56.145 to ₱58.58 to the dollar over the past year. That depreciation alone has inflated the peso value of foreign-denominated debt, tightening fiscal space even before new borrowings enter the picture. This vulnerability is deepened by a governance storm that Recto himself acknowledges but does not fully confront. The flood-control scandal, which began as a procurement anomaly, has widened into a larger indictment of the national budget process. Investors have taken notice. Public construction slowed during the third quarter as agencies reexamined procurement flows; foreign funds, already cautious, pulled back further; and the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) Index reflected the country’s governance anxiety with lackluster performance. The result is a market increasingly inclined to price a governance risk premium into Philippine assets — a premium that low inflation, on its own, cannot offset. His promise of a “better, stronger Philippine economy ahead” arrives at a moment when the administration is eager to reclaim the narrative. Inflation has fallen to multi-year lows, governance initiatives are showcased as proof of reform, and the Palace is intent on signaling renewed economic momentum heading into 2026. On the surface, the optimism is defensible: headline inflation sits at 1.5%, the country maintains a BBB+ rating with a Positive Outlook, and criminal cases stemming from the flood-control scandal have produced visible arrests, asset freezes, and restitutions. Yet the data carefully threaded through this political storyline tells a more complicated truth — one that demands scrutiny as the country’s debt climbs to ₱17.56 trillion and its macroeconomic pillars show signs of stress. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) sharpened this contrast when on Thursday, December 11, it capped 2025 with another 25-basis point policy rate cut, lowering the benchmark borrowing rate to 4.5%. That move, the fifth cut this year and the eighth since August 2024, officially places the economy in an aggressive easing cycle — one enabled by collapsing inflation, but driven by something far less celebratory: weakening growth and rising governance risk. The BSP move acknowledges that overall business sentiment “has continued to decline” due to governance concerns and global uncertainty, and that GDP growth “continued to weaken further.” The third quarter’s 4% expansion, down sharply from earlier quarters, marks the slowest pace since the pandemic-era recovery and reflects the corrosive impact of the flood-control scandal on investor sentiment, public spending execution, and capital formation. The BSP’s decision to ease policy rate, despite a fragile peso, underscores the complexity of the moment. At ₱58.58 to the dollar in October, the peso has depreciated steadily from ₱56.145 a year earlier, eroding purchasing power and inflating foreign-denominated obligations. Every incremental weakening now directly inflates the government’s external-debt burden — already a significant component of the ₱17.56 trillion outstanding stock. This is the structural tension at the heart of today’s macroeconomic landscape: easing monetary policy is meant to stimulate domestic demand, even though it risks amplifying the very debt dynamics that constrain fiscal maneuvering. Meanwhile, the economy’s fundamentals present a mixed picture. Private consumption remains the main growth engine, but real wages have only recently begun to recover; youth unemployment ticked up slightly in October; manufacturing output slowed in four of the last six months; and infrastructure disbursements — supposedly the backbone of the administration’s growth strategy — fell behind schedule due to integrity reviews triggered by corruption investigations. Foreign direct investment inflows, which peaked at US$10.5 billion in 2021, have moderated to around $7.8 billion in the first ten months of 2025, reflecting a cautious external stance toward Philippine political risk. The current account deficit remains sizable at roughly 2.5% of GDP, financed increasingly by short-term portfolio flows rather than long-term investments. Remittances could continue to provide resilience — growing 2.6% year-to-date — but even this stabilizer is insufficient to counterbalance the broader weakening of capital inflows. Recto’s positiveness, while not unfounded, therefore exists alongside structural vulnerabilities that demand careful weighing. Inflation’s benign behavior — below 2% since February — has indeed given the central bank room to maneuver, but the BSP itself warns that the easing cycle is “nearing its end,” and any additional cuts will be strictly data-dependent. It has revised its inflation forecasts modestly upward for 2026 and 2027, signaling early caution. Growth projections, meanwhile, paint a slower path than what the Palace implies: the BSP expects a “gradual” recovery, driven not by organic momentum, but by the lagged effects of monetary easing and improved public spending efficiency. This is not the language of an economy sprinting toward a strong rebound; it is the language of an institution preparing for a long, uneven healing process. The Philippines does have assets: a young demographic profile, resilient remittances, moderating inflation, and a central bank willing to act decisively. Yet the challenge now is credibility: fiscal, institutional, and political. The cumulative 2-percentage-point rate cut since last year may support domestic demand, but unless governance reforms translate into predictable budgeting, transparent procurement, and restored investor trust, monetary stimulus alone will not deliver the “strong comeback” heralded by the administration. The country must grow faster than its debt, restore confidence faster than scandals can erode it, and bolster the peso faster than external shocks can weaken it. Recto’s optimism may indeed prove prophetic — but only if the numbers, not the rhetoric, begin moving in his desired direction. The “better, stronger” economic phase will depend, not on inflation numbers or international ratings, but on the country’s ability to confront the structural risks that soften the foundations beneath Recto’s upbeat narrative. This is where the administration’s narrative becomes difficult to sustain. Recto’s emphasis on the Philippines’ better inflation numbers — a genuine achievement given global price volatility — neither neutralize concerns over the country’s debt trajectory nor calm markets increasingly sensitive to institutional instability. Price stability may support consumption, but it does not address the deeper risks posed by slower output expansion, rising refinancing costs, and a currency that remains vulnerable to both global conditions and local governance shocks. The government’s optimism rests on inflation data, while investors are looking at debt ratios, fiscal credibility, and signals from the political economy. It is no coincidence that Recto’s statement devotes substantial attention to the administration’s anti-corruption drive. The flood-control scandal — which now implicates lawmakers, Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) officials, and contractors — has evolved into a broader examination of how the national budget is crafted, allocated, and potentially manipulated. That the executive secretary finds it necessary to highlight arrests, AMLC asset freezes amounting to ₱13 billion, the auction of ₱38.2 million worth of seized luxury vehicles, and the ₱110 million restitution from a DPWH district engineer, speaks volumes about the scale of reputational damage the scandal has inflicted. Markets do not respond to arrests as they do to institutional reform, but they do react to credibility risk — and the scandal has already tightened scrutiny on the entire ₱6-trillion fiscal cycle. Even public construction, a traditional growth engine, has shown signs of deceleration, as agencies quietly reassess procurement procedures in the wake of the controversy. Foreign funds that had already reduced exposure to Philippine equities and bonds now cite governance uncertainty as a major reason for maintaining underweight positions. In this sense, Recto’s assurances of stronger governance become less a sign of institutional strength and more an admission that the Marcos Jr. administration knows market confidence is fragile and must be aggressively managed. The promise of a “disciplined” ₱6.793-trillion budget for 2026 reinforces this point. Governments do not promise discipline unless they know discipline is in doubt. The budget process — magnified by the controversies of bicameral insertions — has turned into a barometer of political influence rather than economic planning. Investors understand this intuitively, rating agencies model it explicitly, and the peso now reflects it through sensitivity to governance headlines. Recto’s optimism that reforms, tax enforcement recalibrations, and investment promotion efforts will revive growth in 2026 is plausible only if the government can rebuild trust in the fiscal system itself. The macroeconomic risks ahead are neither abstract nor distant. A debt-to-GDP ratio drifting toward 62 to 63% would place the Philippines at the edge of ratings-agency caution. A continued slide of the peso could widen fiscal gaps and further inflate foreign debt obligations. A slowdown in public or private investment — even marginal — could weaken the growth base needed to sustain long-term borrowing. These are not risks that inflation can offset, or issues that can be resolved merely by high-level assurances of a “strong comeback.” Ultimately, the Philippines stands at a critical juncture where credibility has become the economy’s most valuable — and most vulnerable — asset. Recto’s optimism is not misplaced; it is incomplete. The administration’s success will depend, not on inflation numbers or credit ratings, but on whether it can restore confidence in the country’s fiscal architecture, institutional discipline, and governance systems. Until then, markets will continue to price the economy, not on the promise of better days, but on the reality of rising debt, slowing growth, and a political environment still struggling to convince investors that the rules of public finance are stable, predictable, and enforced. – Rappler.com Click here for more Vantage Point articles.",True,true,"[Vantage Point] As BSP cuts policy rates, PH’s mounting debts weaken optimism",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-philippine-government-debt-october-2025-undercuts-optimism/,Rappler
"This week, on October 28, Tuesday, the peso slid to a historic low of P59.13 per US dollar. To be sure, this is not our first brush with the P59 per US dollar mark. You might recall that we’ve had similar brushes back in September-October 2022, and also November-December 2024. I wrote about it last year. What’s different now is that the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas or BSP seems to be more willing to allow the peso to slide even further, breaching the psychological P60-per-US-dollar barrier. BSP Governor Eli Remolona said that P60 per US dollar “is a possibility.” The BSP added that, “The recent peso depreciation may reflect market concerns over a potential moderation in economic growth due in part to the infrastructure spending controversy, as well as expectations of additional monetary policy easing by the BSP.” You see, even before the flood control controversy, our growth prospects were already dimming. The government had already trimmed its growth targets from 6-8% down to 5.5-6.5%. Reaching 6% growth these days seems like a moonshot. Slower growth is made worse by the flood control scandal. Myriad business groups are desperately asking the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to credibly solve this mess, because investors here and abroad are fast losing confidence in the Philippines. In a strongly worded statement, a big group of employers and workers’ associations recently called out the feeble investigations and prosecution of the government of people involved in flood control corruption. They said, “Instead of hold departure orders, we are told to be content with immigration lookout bulletins for now. Instead of criminal charges, we are fed daily promises of cases ‘soon to be filed.’ Instead of open transparent hearings, we get closed-door investigations whose direction remains unknown.” Worse, it’s possible that some investors are already moving their capital away from the Philippines to invest elsewhere. The stock market’s capitalization went down by hundreds of billions of pesos in recent weeks. When investors flee, the demand for dollars increases, and this makes the peso weaker. BSP Governor Remolona also remarked that there are now “fewer companies with expansion plans.” In case you missed it, even before this brouhaha, foreign direct investments have been stagnant (rather than growing) in recent years. The peso’s slide could be reversed by a sufficiently strong inflow of dollars. But foreign investors’ perceptions on the Philippine economy are also souring. Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez, our ambassador to the US, alleged that at least $100 billion in investments are being put off because of recent political events. The BSP, if it wanted to, can prevent the exchange rate from reaching P60 per US dollar. This was done before by the BSP under the watch of former governor Benjamin Diokno. Back in 2022, he drew a line in the sand and said that the BSP will aggressively prevent a breach. This was done by selling billions of dollars of the BSP’s reserves. Fast-forward to 2025, Governor Remolona seems less inclined to do such a thing. I would tend to agree with him. Shelling out tons of dollars just to avoid P60 per US dollar seems a huge waste of money. It would be better to keep that money to maintain a sufficiently large buffer of international reserves. Just let the exchange rate be determined by supply and demand. Of course, “defending” the peso may seem politically attractive, because it would be a historic first if we reached P60 per US dollar under Marcos’ watch. And not a few people might think that a historically “weak” peso might reflect a similar weakness of the President. But to be honest, I don’t care too much for the terms “weak” or “strong” peso. A “weak” peso, for instance, is actually a good thing for exporters (because our goods and services become more competitive) and dollar-earning OFWs (because the money they send home will translate into more pesos). The bigger concern is that our export industry is not sufficiently diversified to begin with: the biggest chunk of our exports remains to be semiconductors, and we can’t expect to earn a lot more if we don’t export goods which are higher value-added. The fact that the peso is weakening also suggests that remittance growth is not as strong as they used to be (because strong remittance inflows would tend to make the peso stronger rather than weaker). Above anything else, the weaker peso is a sign of weaker confidence in the Philippine economy. And the longer it takes for the Marcos administration to go after (and even jail) the corrupt, the longer it will take for business confidence to recover, and the more capital will want to flee the country. The peso’s fate is in the hands of Marcos himself. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of False Nostalgia: The Marcos “Golden Age” Myths and How to Debunk Them.

"NEW YORK, USA – Big retailers traditionally spend millions on attracting eyeballs for the holiday season. Now, they’re looking to get noticed by something else — AI agents. Most of this holiday season’s projected $253 billion in US online sales will happen through website visits or standard online searches that favor companies that spend big on search engine ads. But chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini have become part of the mix, with shopper-facing tools that can give product descriptions, compare prices, or allow purchases directly within large-language models as US consumers increasingly use AI for advice on the best holiday stocking stuffers. “We’ve seen brands that previously were putting out three or four new blog posts or articles a month, are now trying to do 100 or 200,” said Brian Stempeck, chief executive at generative engine optimization platform Evertune.ai, which works with clients to make their websites discoverable by large language models. The company charges “around $3,000” per month to its clients, which include apparel and shoe companies, for its services, Stempeck said. Traditionally, retailers based their Google and Meta ad placements on phrases that users searched for or links they previously clicked. Without the ability to advertise in the largest generative AI tools, companies are trying new methods, like posting more frequently on branded blogs or writing about their products on Reddit. Big retailers are building websites that cannot be seen by shoppers, intended to be read solely by AI scrapers, automated data extraction tools that scour the internet for information. The scrapers then feed information to platforms like ChatGPT and Gemini, which then offer suggestions on gifts, apparel and other holiday merchandise. Traffic to retail websites from generative AI platforms is currently still a fraction of overall activity. ChatGPT referrals to Amazon, Walmart and eBay in October accounted for less than 1% of each site’s overall traffic, according to data firm Sensor Tower. EBay said while traffic from AI sources is a small percentage of overall traffic, shoppers finding its links through agentic AI come to the online marketplace with high intent. Walmart did not respond to a request for comment. But retailers clearly see an opportunity. Bed linen company Brooklinen is paying social media influencers to talk about its bath towels and comforters on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok, Brooklinen Chief Operating Officer Rachel Levy said. AI scrapers pull information from the text of product reviews and audio transcripts on these posts. Brooklinen has also submitted its $199 comforter for awards from publications like the New York Times’ Wirecutter to boost its chances of appearing in AI agent responses. Currently, traffic from agentic AI sources is “super small,” she said, because Gen Z, the biggest adopter of tools like ChatGPT, has less buying power than older generations. Miami-based hair care company R+Co is buying ads on Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa based on the questions that customers are asking its Rufus agent, R+Co President Dan Langer said. Google recently introduced features that help shoppers use AI to track prices and buy goods, a task that can only happen if retailers share product details through the tech giant’s merchant center directly or when their products are easily found by its scrapers. Its AI mode and Gemini chatbot consider numerous factors, such as store locations or retailer quality when referring links to users, said Lilian Rincon, vice president of product for Google Shopping. Google is testing ads in AI Mode currently in the U.S., but not the Gemini app, the company said. Existing Shopping and Performance Max ad product campaigns are eligible to show up in AI mode through the testing, the company said. ChatGPT on Monday released additional shopping features to help people with product comparisons and search for “lookalikes” merchandise. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on the company’s October earnings call that shoppers who use Rufus are 60% more likely to buy products. Among large retailers, Walmart and Target both recently announced plans for apps to allow people to shop directly with chatbots. – Rappler.com",True,true,"As AI reshapes shopping, US retailers try to change how they’re seen online",https://www.rappler.com/technology/ai-reshaping-us-shopping-retailers-adapt/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is reviewing calls to oust Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) President and General Manager Jose Arnulfo “Wick” Veloso over alleged gross mismanagement of government workers’ pension fund, Malacañang said. Presidential Communications Office (PCO) Undersecretary Claire Castro said in a briefing on Monday, October 20, that Marcos expected agency heads to demonstrate proper leadership and would not hesitate to act on the controversies surrounding the GSIS chief. “Hindi naman po agad-agad nabibigla dahil kung mayroon pong mga reklamo sa ngayon, dapat po itong inaaral nang masinsinan (The President can’t just act on these complaints on a whim because these should be thoroughly reviewed),” Castro said. Malacañang’s remarks come after past and present GSIS officials urged Veloso to resign for the alleged mismanagement of the social security fund for GSIS members, which supposedly resulted in P8.8 billion in investment losses. According to the group’s letter to Veloso dated October 14, Veloso has exhibited a pattern of actions that were seemingly designed to bypass the proper governance of the investment fund. This includes splitting investment transactions to circumvent the need for the GSIS Board’s approval. “Your actions have fundamentally undermined the integrity and collegiality of the Board. Rather than engaging in professional discourse, you have resorted to fabricating issues and weaponizing administrative procedures to retaliate against members exercising their fiduciary duty of oversight,” they wrote. The six individuals, including four incumbent members of the GSIS Board, flagged investments in companies such as Eusebio Tanco’s DigiPlus Interactive Corporation, Enrique Razon’s Bloomberry Resorts Corporation, and Alternergy Holdings Corporation. The Ombudsman previously placed Veloso under preventive suspension over the P1.45-billion investment into Alternergy, but this was lifted in September. Veloso has since vowed to dispose of GSIS’ stake in DigiPlus and Alternergy once the market improves. As of 1:46 pm on Monday trade, Alternergy share prices were flat at P0.88 apiece, while DigiPlus shares were 0.22% higher at P23 apiece. In a statement on Friday, October 17, Veloso said he will not step down as he serves at the pleasure of the President. He insisted that claims over investment losses were baseless and that the state workers’ pension fund has outperformed its targets for the year. “As of August 2025, GSIS’s total assets have climbed to P1.92 trillion, net income has reached P100.02 billion, and total income stands at P231.06 billion. These results clearly demonstrate that, despite market headwinds, GSIS remains financially strong, resilient, and highly profitable,” Veloso wrote. – Rappler.com",True,true,Marcos reviewing calls to sack GSIS chief Veloso,https://www.rappler.com/business/marcos-jr-reviews-calls-ouster-gsis-president-wick-veloso/,Rappler
"CEBU, Philippines – Just weeks after a 6.9-magnitude earthquake and Typhoon Tino (Kalmaegi) devastated communities across Cebu province, over 400 business process outsourcing (BPO) workers were notified they would be placed on floating status, a temporary layoff with no pay and no option to seek similar work for up to six months. The notice from Wipro Cebu arrived as many were still repairing damaged homes and dealing with disrupted utilities, compounding the strain of the back-to-back disasters. BPO Industry Employees’ Network (BIEN)-Cebu chairperson Kyle Enero told Rappler that the layoffs have further heightened employees’ anxieties, particularly among long-serving workers. “Lisod sa ilaha jud,” said Enero. “Klaro ang tumong sa paglay-off sa ilaha: pagputol sa length of service nga mapugos og resign ang mga ahente aron mas gamay ilahang mahatag nga bayad ug benepisyo. Sa ingon ani nga pamaagi, gipakita sa kumpanya nga pagpasiguro sa dakong ginansya gihapon ang prayoridad.” (It is really difficult for them. The purpose of the layoff is clear: to cut the length-of-service of employees, forcing agents to resign so the company can provide lower pay and benefits. This way, the company shows that securing large profits remains its top priority.) This adds to ongoing labor and safety concerns in Cebu City’s BPO sector, where employees were reportedly forced to work during the September 30 earthquake despite building damage, with some threatened for opting to evacuate and others sent back to production floors without proper safety checks. Several of the affected Wipro Cebu employees have been with the company for six years or more, and many of them found the layoff notice completely unexpected. Enero told Rappler that for long-serving workers, the announcement “felt like a form of betrayal after years of service.” Workers also questioned Wipro’s claim that the layoffs were due to performance issues since some of the affected employees are among the company’s top performers, making the decision appear arbitrary. “They say it’s really unfair because the reason given for selecting them for the layoff was their performance, even though performance isn’t actually an issue, as some top performers were also included,” said Enero in Cebuano. He recounted the case of a worker who was initially placed on floating status arbitrarily and later subjected to a performance improvement plan for allegedly poor performance, despite already being on floating status at the time. He added that the same employee has now been included in Wipro’s latest round of floating layoffs. “This only exposes that the BPO industry practice of placing agents on floating status, combined with a high attrition rate, puts workers in a precarious situation where their livelihood is directly affected, often forcing them to leave the company — not by choice, but due to circumstances — which essentially amounts to constructive dismissal,” said Enero. He added that during his conversations with workers, their main concern was their benefits and fair compensation, particularly as many are still recovering from the recent typhoon and earthquake. Enero explained that the floating status system is a new form of cost-cutting in the BPO industry, designed to pressure employees to resign so companies can avoid paying benefits that increase with length of service. “While floating status is legal, it does not make it moral or ethical,” he said. Rappler has reached out to Wipro Cebu for comment. This story will be updated once we get a response. In a statement, BIEN-Cebu condemned Wipro’s recent actions, describing the placement of over 400 employees on floating status as an attack on workers’ rights. “While Wipro management has initiated a reprofiling process, they remain deaf to workers’ requests for separation pay and the option to exit the company,” the network said. BIEN-Cebu also urged the Wipro management to grant severance pay to employees placed on floating status, honor requests from workers who wish to be reprofiled to other roles, and show genuine compassion for those still recovering from recent calamities. Enero recently filed a request for dialogue with the Department of Labor and Employment-Regional Office VII (DOLE-VII) to discuss updates on inspections following the September 30 earthquake and address the numerous cases of temporary layoffs in the BPO sector. – Rappler.com Marjuice Destinado is a senior political science student at Cebu Normal University (CNU) and an alumna of the Aries Rufo Journalism Fellowship of Rappler for 2025.",True,true,"After back-to-back disasters, 400 Cebu BPO workers face job uncertainty",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/visayas/cebu-bpo-winpro-workers-job-uncertainty-disasters-2025/,Rappler
"LONDON, United Kingdom – Global investors managing over $3 trillion in assets called on governments on Monday, October 20, to stop and reverse deforestation and ecosystem degradation by 2030, in a statement signed ahead of a United Nations climate conference in Brazil next month. Around 30 institutional investors including Swiss private bank Pictet Group and Nordic investor DNB Asset Management have so far signed up to the Belém Investor Statement on Rainforests, which is open until November 1. A report last week found the world is falling far short of the goal of stopping deforestation, with losses of 8.1 million hectares (20 million acres) of forest — an area about the size of England — in 2024 alone, largely driven by agricultural expansion and forest fires. “As investors, we are increasingly concerned about the material financial risks that tropical deforestation and nature loss pose to our portfolios,” the statement said. The investors emphasized the need for policies that deliver legal, regulatory, and financial certainty to help protect the forests and safeguard economic stability, said Jan Erik Saugestad, chief executive officer at Nordic firm Storebrand Asset Management. “Deforestation undermines the natural systems that global markets rely on — from climate regulation to food and water security.” Earlier this year, the European Union delayed launching its anti-deforestation law by a year after facing opposition from industry and trade partners such as Brazil, Indonesia, and the United States, who say complying with the rules would be costly and hurt their exports to Europe. The role of climate skeptic US President Donald Trump in rolling back support for global environmental efforts was also hampering action, said Ingrid Tungen, head of deforestation-free markets at Rainforest Foundation Norway. “I think Trump has made it more difficult for investors and managers to take climate and biodiversity into account in such a volatile market,” she said. “All the investors that we are talking to think there is a huge risk for us not taking diversification and climate change into consideration in the long term, and not just for their own morals, but because that will harm the markets directly and their profits directly.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Investors managing $3 trillion in assets urge countries to stop deforestation,https://www.rappler.com/business/belem-investor-statement-rainforests-2025/,Rappler
"TOKYO, Japan – Japan’s Asahi Group on Thursday, November 27, said the personal details of 1.52 million customers may have been leaked in a September cyberattack. The beverage maker said the September 29 cyberattack forced it to suspend operations including order processing, shipping and call-center functions. Asahi said it consequently delayed the release of its July-September earnings results scheduled for November 12 to more than 50 days after the end of the quarter. “We can’t avoid forecasting a deterioration in our results but our mid-to-long-term management plan is unchanged,” CEO Atsushi Katsuki said at a press briefing. The disruption saw restaurants, bars and stores in Japan run low on Asahi beer —including best-selling “Super Dry” brand — and other drinks.

"MANILA, Philippines – Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC) is creating a standalone international company in preparation for a possible listing on a United States securities exchange by 2027, the fastfood giant announced on Tuesday, January 6. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), JFC said its international operations and business will be separated from its Philippine counterpart through the establishment of Jollibee Foods Corporation International (JFCI). This new firm will encapsulate all operations and businesses outside of the Philippines. JFC’s Philippine operations, meanwhile, will remain listed on the local bourse. The company explained that the spinoff will allow both entities to sharpen their strategic focus. “Built on a capital-light model with significant whitespace for expansion, it is positioned to operate in markets that support companies pursuing international scale, innovation, and long-term global growth,” the fastfood giant owned by Tony Tan Caktiong said. JFC added that it is already working on establishing the structure, process, and timing for the separation of the two business units and JFCI’s potential international listing. This may include any restructuring and asset transfers. Jollibee Group’s global president and chief executive officer Ernesto Tanmantiong said the spin-off and its potential US listing will demonstrate the firm’s strength on the global change. “As a proudly homegrown Philippine company, we carry our heritage and express our national pride into this next chapter of our journey. Our move toward an international listing demonstrates the strength of the Jollibee Group, a company with Filipino roots competing on the world stage,” he wrote in a statement. According to Rappler’s stock market analyst Den Somera, the spin-off will unlock values for JFC that the Philippine market cannot due to its current limitations. However, it remains unclear how the assets will be split between the two firms. Nonetheless, he said “the plan is beneficial to JFC price in the short term.” Unicapital equity research analyst Jeri Alfonso likened JFC’s spinoff to San Miguel Brewery’s (SMB) split from the main San Miguel Corporation (SMC) conglomerate in 2007. With the split, SMB gave investors the option to put their money in San Miguel’s brewery business, and provide the firm with more focused management. “After the deal, JFC on the PSE will be a pure domestic play, making it more comparable to local peers like Max’s Group (MAXS) and Shakey’s (PIZZA),” Alfonso told Rappler in a Viber message. While JFC’s share price is expected to drop due to the split, Alfonso believes the price will eventually adjust accordingly to fairly compensate existing investors. “In addition to this, bear in mind JFC shareholders will get JFCI shares as a property dividend,” she pointed out. According to JFC’s annual report, its international business units include the following: Meanwhile, its Philippine business units include Jollibee Philippines, Mang Inasal, Greenwich, and Red Ribbon. It also includes its foreign franchised brands such as Burger King, Panda Express, Yoshinoya, and Tiong Bahru Bakery. JFC posted a net income of just over P9 billion in the first nine months of 2025, with system-wide sales (SWS) of the Philippine business growing 5.5% in the third quarter. Its international business’ SWS also jumped 32.4% in the January-September 2025 period thanks to Compose Coffee and the strong performance of Jollibee’s international markets. During the first nine months of 2025, Compose Coffee’s SWS surged 540.9% and CBTL’s revenues also grew 13.9%. Milksha, which JFC acquired in 2025, saw its SWS grow 5.9%, while Tim Ho Wan‘s system-wide sales contracted by 20.2%.

"MANILA, Philippines – The global think tank Tony Blair Institute on Thursday, July 24, released a report outlining how government strategies on leveraging AI technology for the economy should focus on a human-centric “augmented” approach rather than allowing for the outright automation of tasks. The paper recalls how previous industrial revolutions such as mechanization in the 18th century led to physical labor being superseded by machines — a shift that governments then responded to by prioritizing education that would open opportunities for cognitive work. Now, that cognitive work is at the risk of being replaced by generative AI, which has shown the capacity to process information and data, and produce something out of it such as computer code, a written analysis, or a new image or video. The institute proposes what it calls “augmented intelligence,” an approach that seeks to empower the worker to use AI as a tool, and allow themselves to perform “higher-order tasks.” “By embedding machine-generated insights into workflows, this approach enables a broader segment of the workforce – particularly those in practical, hands-on roles — to perform higher-order tasks such as data interpretation, situational judgement and adaptive decision-making to make roles more productive, meaningful and futureproofed,” the institute says. Examples include care assistants using AI to monitor their patient’s wellbeing, electrical technicians using AI-enabled drones and diagnostics to make repairs, or paramedics using AI to provide timely, critical insights. “In short, augmented intelligence is about creating new kinds of jobs that combine human empathy, judgement and adaptability with the power of AI,” it says. Human empathy, judgement, and adaptability, among other humanistic traits, appear to remain as part of a person’s domain and not that of an AI system’s at least for now. Just as humans found a way to specialize in cognitive work as mechanical tools took over physical labor in the past, the challenge now, as the paper shows, is to find the tasks that only a human is able to achieve. The study looks at 3 countries — Singapore, Vietnam, and the Phlippines — and presents an overview of the challenges that each faces in adopting the “augmented intelligence” approach. In the Philippines, the paper provides 4 examples how this approach might look like in several industries: How does the country get there? The report notes several government initiatives that point to a development vision that has AI squarely in its sights. Under the Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028, the National AI Strategy Roadmap 2.0, and Philippine Skills Framework, AI and digitalization are looked at as major components in fostering economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. The AI roadmap presents a plan for integrating AI into key industries, while the skills framework seeks to align educational outcomes with the AI-related jobs of the future. The Department of Education also established The Education Center for AI Research in February 2025 while the National Innovation Council, directly under the President, established an AI thinktank in March 2025 that seeks to inform AI policies and improve the country’s global competitiveness. All of these initiatives are meant to steer the populace to an AI-enabled economy wherein generative AI is expected to contribute P2.8 trillion by 2030, the report says. Will the country get there? The study outlines a few major hurdles. First of all, connectivity remains an issue, especially when one compares connectivity in the cities versus the provinces. It says that policies should “address the urban-rural digital divide by expanding access to affordable digital infrastructure, such as connectivity, and training programs.​” The government needs to come in to help smaller businesses, and industries in the province to address a digital gap that slows down AI adoption. Increasing funding for AI research as well as incentivizing the development of homegrown digital solutions are seen as necessary pillars to help the country reach its AI goals. Upskilling, with the proposed “augmented intelligence” approach will also be urgently needed as the International Monetary Fund expects that 4 out of 10 jobs in the Philippines will be affected by AI. Cybersecurity is a part of the picture as well, as data breaches may erode the trust people have in digital systems. “Stakeholders emphasized the need for a shift towards more proactive policies in which governments do not merely mitigate risks, but actively shape AI adoption to create economic and social value. This shift will include fostering public-private partnerships, setting clear regulatory frameworks, and incentivizing local innovation ecosystems and entities to flourish,” the study says. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Gov’t-led AI plans underway but infrastructure, skills need addressing – think tank",https://www.rappler.com/technology/philippines-ai-plans-roadmap-2025-digital-infrastructure-upskilling/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Social Security System (SSS) marked 2025 with a landmark three-year pension reform that will increase benefits without increasing contribution rates. Starting September 1, the state pension fund raised retirement and disability pensions by 10%, while death and survivor pensions will be increased by 5%. SSS president and Chief Executive Officer Robert Joseph Montes De Claro said the state pension fund will carry out the second tranche of pension hikes on September 1, 2026. The final wave of pension hikes will take effect in September 2027. By the end of the three-year program, benefits for retirement and disability pensioners will have increased by 33% while death and survivor pensioners’ benefits are estimated to grow 16%. This will cover over 3.8 million SSS pensioners, including 2.6 million retirement or disability pensioners and 1.2 million survivor pensioners. Apart from pension increases, the SSS also aims to launch a micro loan program in early 2026. Its emergency loan program with a 7% interest rate from the original 10% will also be available until December 2026 or until the state of national calamity is lifted. De Claro earlier said the pension hike will shorten its fund life to 2049 from 2053. But he is confident that this will be offset by stronger cash flows from previous contribution increases and enhanced collection efforts. “Our actuarial team confirms that the fund remains financially sound. We are committed to restoring fund life back to 2053 through coverage expansion and improved collection efficiency,” he said. The SSS in January implemented a 1% contribution hike to 15% from 14% as part of a rate hike that started in 2019. As of September 2024, the SSS has nearly P55 billion in assets and has P11.3 billion in reserves for the future payment of employee compensation claims. De Claro previously said they expect SSS’ net income growth to slow down in 2025 as the fund implements the three-year pension hike. However, he remains optimistic that the pension fund will make at least P100 billion. The SSS made a P90.2 billion profit in 2024, with earnings from the fund’s investments contributing more than half of its bottomline. The SSS currently has around P500 billion invested in long-term government securities while the remaining 45% of the fund’s portfolio is invested in the capital market and real estate.

"In my last article, I wrote about the just-concluded initial public offering (IPO) of Maynilad Water Services Incorporated, which was listed last Friday, November 7, 2025, under the trading symbol of “MYNLD.” In the article, I mentioned that with the exception of Joel De la Peña, market strategist and chief trader of H.E. Bennett Securities Incorporated, who was dead sure that MYNLD would tank even on listing day, the rest of the traders I talked to were optimistic, albeit cautious. To what I see in last Friday’s listing, MYNLD may be in for a difficult ride like what the market has been in general: MYNLD opened at its IPO offer price of P15 per share that also served as its session high; it traded lower to P14.98 a piece that also served as its session’s low and closing price for the day. Correspondingly, MYNLD was down P0.020 or 0.13% with a total volume for the day of about 100.81 million shares on a total value turnover of approximately P1.51 billion. This happened on the back of a selling pressure on the issue itself. To what I was told, one of the underwriters was behind the sell off. Nevertheless, it may be too early yet to say whether MYNLD will fall in the coming days as De la Peña is anticipating. MYNLD only fell one fluctuation lower throughout the trading session. On second thought, considering that MYNLD never had the chance to go up any higher than its opening price all throughout the trading session, it’s very possible that De la Peña may just get his wishes to come true. This is also supported by one almost forgotten maxim in the market, which says that a market’s one-year performance is sometimes already known by the results of its trading performance from its first month of trading for the year. Likewise, MYNLD’s initial trading performance may just be indicative enough of where the market is headed to. Remember, last Friday’s trading results: the market tanked again lower. This time, it closed at its three-year low of 5,759.37, reminiscent of its trading close on October 3, 2022. From what it has been doing all these months up to its trading results last Friday, the technical picture of the market can be described as: “bearish, facing significant pressure, and trading at historically low valuations.” In comparison to its regional and international peers, the market is now one of the world’s worst-performing markets. Out of this performance, around 18% or more of the market’s value has been lost since then. The general P/E ratio of the Philippine Stock Exchange Index’s (PSEi) composite stocks has now also gone down to as low as 8.2x. In retrospect, this is lower than the market’s P/E multiple during the March 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Based on historical averages, the market can be described as “significantly undervalued.” The market’s continuing fall has been attributed to the trading tack of foreign investors who have been described as “aggressively cashing out.” Foreign investors have been net sellers for the year until last Friday. The general pessimism stems from a combination of local and global factors. Foremost to local and foreign investors’ concern is the country’s slowing economic growth. As corroborated in last Friday announcement, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) slowed down in the 3rd quarter. GDP only grew by 4%. There are three major factors that are blamed for the market’s continued weakness and the country’s weak GDP growth. The first is about the escalating corruption scandal on public funds used in the government’s flood control program. The second is about the government’s weak spending or underspending activity to spur the economy. The third is about the structural issues confronting the market. The flood control corruption scandal has greatly angered the general public just as it has significantly eroded investors’ confidence and dampened bullish sentiments. Aside from the sporadic pockets of public rallies that are being held since the corruption scandal was exposed, a grand protest-rally similar to the historic EDSA People Power movement is being planned to be held on November 30. What it may come to as a result may also have a serious impact on the future political landscape, especially on the alignments among the political players. As to the government’s public spending program to spur economic growth, the government is reportedly lagging behind, especially on its educational and social safety nets, targeted spending to boost agriculture, climate resilience, and digital connectivity, in addition to its “Build Better More” infrastructure program. The government is called on to move faster on these areas of concerns. On its structural issues, the market continues to face medium- to long-term challenges, particularly to its liquidity and trading volume, which can be described as poor and thin compared to its regional peers. Added to that, the market lacks sectoral diversity. At present, the index is heavily concentrated in financials and industrials. Likewise, fewer companies are opting to go public due to the higher costs and stringent rules to get listed. Listed firms have, as well, historically underperformed — like what may just happen again to MYNLD despite being a great issue to lock in one’s investible fund. Senator Imee Marcos recently gave a simple solution to the market’s structural issues. At first, it appeared almost ridiculous but come to think of it, her suggestion has some sense of logic: it’s about time the bourse’s president, Ramon Monzon, is replaced. To her, Monzon has been there for too long for during his watch, the market has gone through the full cycle of trading from doom-to-boom and then from boom-to-doom seemingly oblivious — as in unaffected or unmitigated — by his presence. She then simply concludes that Monzon had his time, and the board of the bourse should now put new blood in the leadership helm. With regard to investors’ outlook, like any perspective, I believe that this will change eventually for the better — although not that soon, maybe. At the moment, many investors are taking a “risk-off” or “defensive positioning” stance. The market is definitely now out of favor: the local economy’s status, along with the political issues and the sporadic cases of social unrest, have not been helpful. The weakening of our currency against the US dollar to historic lows has likewise created selling pressures in the market. Together with concerns over a global economic slowdown and the not-so-impressive performance of key sectors like our electronics exports, the market has become that soft, and investors’ confidence has gone low. However, despite the overall market weakness, certain sectors continue to show some resilience and potential. Among these are the financial companies. The financials index has shown positive movements. The major banks have shown strong balance sheets supported by relatively high-interest-rate margins. Next is the mining and oil sector. It is also showing some promise: this sector has exhibited significant gains over time, driven by increasing commodity price trends and local policy developments. Among these government policies include the lifting of the moratorium on new mining permits, lifting the ban on open-pit mining, and promoting transparency through the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The EITI is a global standard for the open and accountable management of oil, gas, and mineral resources. It aims to improve governance in the extractive sector by requiring governments and companies to disclose information on contracts, production, revenues, and beneficial ownership. This disclosure helps to curb corruption, informed public debate, and promote reforms. The other supports arising from the government’s recent policies include financial incentives like tax exemptions on imported equipment for offshore oil and gas operations and a program to manage mineral reservations. The government has also started to focus on environmental and sustainability reforms to encourage responsible development and secure a place in global mineral supply chains. Continued government spending on the “Build, Better, More” program has provided a solid medium-term outlook for construction-related companies, as well. This sector is favored by investment analysts, supported by the Philippines’ strong domestic consumption base and robust remittances from overseas Filipinos. Despite these gleaming potentials that are present in the market, it may not still be timely to enter the market — in the same way like how De la Peña is thinking about buying MYNLD. Prices are already at their historical lows but due to low investors’ confidence and global uncertainties, the price of most stocks at the moment could still prove to be a value trap. A value trap is a situation when a stock or market appears to be an excellent bargain due to low valuation metrics, but is actually in a prolonged decline because of underlying fundamental problems. Unlike a true value stock and market ,which is expected to recover, a value trap’s stock price or market valuation continues to fall due to technical and fundamental issues. Until then, our market remains to be a value trap. – Rappler.com (The article has been prepared for general circulation for the reading public and must not be construed as an offer, or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or financial instruments whether referred to herein or otherwise.

"MANILA, Philippines – The 1Sambayan coalition urges Finance Secretary Frederick Go and the National Treasury to return P107.23 billion in “excess funds” to the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC). The PDIC remitted these funds to the Treasury in January 2025 as part of a special provision tied to unprogrammed appropriations under the 2024 General Appropriations Act. This special provision was also used to authorize the transfer of P60 billion in “excess funds” from state health insurer PhilHealth. (READ: Supreme Court orders return of P60B to PhilHealth, bars further fund transfer) The state deposit insurer said the funds were intended for several government projects such as the Metro Manila Subway and the Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situations (AICS), a social aid program criticized for perpetuating political patronage. 1Sambayan pointed out that the Supreme Court already ruled that transfers made under the special provision as unconstitutional. “By this ruling, Special Provision 1(d) and DOF Circular No. 003-2024 were stripped of any legal force. They cannot serve as authority to transfer the funds of any government-owned or controlled corporation to the National Treasury,” the coalition said. Retired Supreme Court associate justice Antonio Carpio, who is also the lead convener of 1Sambayan, earlier said some of the funds remitted by the PDIC were diverted to the construction of flood control projects. Because of the transfer, the PDIC’s assets as of end-2024 dipped to P278 billion from P339.6 billion in 2023. “The drop in net assets is primarily attributed to remittances to the Bureau of the Treasury aggregating P107.2 billion fund balance under the GAA and P10.7 billion dividends, P1.2 billion operating expenses and P300 million payment of insured deposits,” the agency wrote in its 2024 annual report. Despite the transfer, PDIC’s president and chief executive officer Roberto Tan earlier assured depositors that its Deposit Insurance Fund is still enough to cover shocks in the banking system. As the state’s deposit insurer, the PDIC guarantees clients they can receive up to P1 million per depositor per bank in the event of a bank closure. – Rappler.com",True,true,"1Sambayan urges DOF, Treasury to return P107B to PDIC",https://www.rappler.com/business/1sambayan-urges-department-finance-national-treasury-return-pdic-funds/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) set the record straight amid online claims surrounding the market capitalization (MCAP) lost since December 2024. In a statement, the local bourse clarified that domestic MCAP was only down P273 billion or 1.88% from December 2024 to October 2025. The PSE issued the clarification after what it described as a “pseudo-expert” on the stock market falsely claimed that the local bourse lost P5 trillion during that period. “Unfortunately, this fake news was irresponsibly published on the same day and reposted the following day in an online tabloid that is known for prioritizing sensationalism that will generate clicks and engagements over providing news that have been fact-checked or verified,” the PSE said. Market capitalization, also known as market cap, is the total value of the outstanding shares that is traded on the stock market. The PSE explained that it tracks two types of market cap: total and domestic. Domestic MCAP includes Philippine firms that are primarily listed in the PSE. On the other hand, total market cap includes the foreign companies that are also listed with the local bourse: Sun Life Financial, Inc. (SLF), Del Monte Pacific Ltd. (DELM), and Manulife Financial Corporation (MFC). “Since only less than 1% of the outstanding shares of MFC and SLF and less than 5% of DELM are lodged for trading in the PSE, PSE uses domestic MCAP data as the reference number since it more accurately captures the performance of the Philippine stock market,” the PSE said. The local bourse further likened comparing domestic and total MCAP to comparing apples to oranges. “Deliberately comparing apples to oranges by comparing Domestic MCAP to Total MCAP is dishonest, if not malicious, and is clearly meant to provoke investors to lose confidence in the Philippine capital market and destabilize the economy,” the PSE said. The PSE’s clarification also comes after Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chief Francis Lim fell victim to a fake industry report that claimed the stock market lost P1.7 trillion in MCAP in August due to falling investor confidence amid the controversies surrounding anomalous flood control projects. – Rappler.com",True,true,"PSE: Domestic market cap only down P273 billion, not P5 trillion",https://www.rappler.com/business/pse-clarifies-domestic-market-capitalization-october-2025/,Rappler
"On November 21 of this year, Nigeria’s narcotics agency detained an all-Filipino crew after seizing 20 kilos of high-grade cocaine hidden aboard a Panama-registered vessel from Brazil — now under joint scrutiny by United States and British counter-narcotics units patrolling strategic Atlantic and Gulf shipping lanes. The episode underscores a hard geopolitical reality: as maritime routes increasingly double as battlegrounds for great-power influence, law enforcement, and intelligence collection, Filipino seafarers are being pulled into the slipstream of high-stakes security operations — while Manila still lacks a coherent maritime, diplomatic, and intelligence strategy to shield its own workers from the fallout. Even before the Nigeria incident happened, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) on November 12 had already issued Advisory No. 34, framing the document as a protective measure — an institutional shield for the country’s globally deployed seafarers. It presented the document as another loud gesture of solidarity with Filipino seafarers. But the deeper one reads into the memo, the more it reveals a government in full regulatory retreat, ignoring international obligations, undermining global labor standards, and leaving manning and shipping companies to absorb liabilities that properly belong to the State. At its core, the advisory exposes a dangerous truth: the Philippines is abandoning its legal responsibilities just as the world is ramping up maritime enforcement, digital forensics, and cross-border criminal crackdowns. And the cost of this abdication will not be paid by politicians. It will be paid by Filipino seafarers and by the maritime industry that keeps a trillion-peso lifeline flowing into the Philippine economy. The advisory itself acknowledges that Filipino crew members have been deported and arrested in US ports for alleged possession of child-sexual-exploitation material (CSEM) — a crime so severe that any responsible government would launch an immediate inquiry. Yet DMW Advisory No. 34 orders no investigation. It demands no evidence. It seeks no coordination with US Homeland Security, INTERPOL, or even the Philippine Department of Justice. Instead, it instructs manning agencies and foreign shipowners to provide free legal assistance, handle all port-related issues, and report compliance within 30 days — as though the government’s duty under international law can simply be outsourced to private companies that have no jurisdiction in foreign courts. To anyone familiar with the International Labor Organization (ILO), this is an astonishing departure from established global norms. Under the ILO Maritime Labor Convention (MLC), the primary responsibility for the fair treatment of seafarers lies with governments, not private employers. It is the home country’s obligation to secure legal representation, liaise with the detaining State, verify forensic evidence, and protect its nationals from discriminatory or unjust treatment. The MLC’s entire framework is built on the principle that seafarers operate in high-risk, transnational environments and that the State — neither the shipowner nor the manning agency — must serve as the legal, diplomatic, and institutional anchor when its citizens are detained abroad. DMW Advisory No. 34 turns that principle on its head. Rather than fulfilling its ILO mandate, the Philippine government steps aside and compels private actors to perform duties only a sovereign State can legally carry out. The result is a regulatory void: foreign authorities conduct investigations, the Philippine government declares victimhood without evidence, and manning companies are left to navigate criminal proceedings they cannot influence and diplomatic processes they cannot initiate. The ILO envisions state accountability; Memo 34 normalizes state abandonment. The dangers of this approach are already visible. Just days ago, Nigeria’s National Drug Law Enforcement Agency arrested an all-Filipino crew aboard a Panama-registered vessel after uncovering 20 kilograms of high-purity cocaine buried beneath its cargo. Nigeria immediately launched a coordinated, forensic-grade investigation with US and British anti-drug units, tracing trafficking routes across Brazil, Colombia, and West Africa. NDLEA intercepts cocaine shipment from Brazil, detains ship, 20 Filipino crew members. Nigeria is not, and will never be your foothold, Marwa warns drug cartels pic.twitter.com/RetLwLyVWM This is the new enforcement environment: faster, sharper, data-rich, and deeply interconnected. Yet Manila’s response to the Lagos arrests was silence. No consular team was dispatched. No forensic request was filed. No diplomatic intervention was attempted. The Philippine government appeared almost paralyzed — as if the world is acting at a pace and level of sophistication it is unwilling or unable to match. What makes this inertia even more troubling is that the DMW has not merely failed to enforce global standards. The Department has historically mistreated the very industry it now expects to shoulder its burdens. The maritime sector has long endured punitive, arbitrary, and politically motivated regulatory behavior. A major Philippine manning company saw its operations crippled for nearly a year after the government suspended its accreditation over a labor incident that had already been resolved in a European court. Despite clear documentation, the DMW refused to lift the suspension until political pressure eased. Ships were forced to replace Filipino crew with non-Filipino nationals at significant cost. The agency suffered reputational damage that still lingers in international markets. In another instance, thousands of seafarers were stranded when the Philippine government imposed an abrupt deployment freeze, citing “worker protection,” even though no worker had been harmed and the freeze had no basis in any ILO-compliant investigative process. Foreign shipowners absorbed millions in losses as vessels were delayed, rerouted, or compelled to hire emergency replacement crews from other labor-supplying countries. The Philippines — despite being the world’s largest source of maritime labor — treated shipowners as expendable and manning agencies as scapegoats, as though global fleet operators have infinite patience for regulatory chaos. These patterns of behavior erode trust, and trust is the only currency that matters in the maritime world. Shipowners deploy Filipino crew because they trust the workforce, but they also need to trust the Philippine government. They need to know that when a crime is alleged, the government will follow the ILO’s due-process framework — not lash out at employers or retreat into political narratives. They need to know that when foreign authorities act, the Philippines will engage with equal seriousness. They need to know that when allegations are true, the government will confront the problem — not pretend it does not exist. Instead, the DMW has nurtured a culture of denial and deflection. Industry insiders reveal that even before Memo 34 was finalized, DMW officials were already advising seafarers to “check” or “clean” their devices before entering US ports. This advice is catastrophic in its implications. It suggests avoidance rather than compliance, concealment rather than behavioral correction. It trivializes forensic evidence, undermines international cooperation, and sends a signal to the global maritime community that the Philippines views digital-crime enforcement not as a rule-of-law issue, but as a public-relations problem. It is a morally bankrupt posture — one that ignores the reality that CSEM crimes involve real children. The victims are real and the harm is verifiable. The contrast with the ILO could not be starker. Where the MLC requires governments to verify evidence, the DMW assumes discrimination. Where the ILO demands state involvement, Memo 34 demands private sector sacrifice. Where the ILO sees shipowners as partners, the DMW treats them as disposable. Where the MLC envisions transparency, Manila substitutes political theater. The maritime world is changing. Enforcement regimes are tightening. Digital forensics is becoming more precise. Transnational criminal networks are being dismantled through coordinated intelligence efforts. In this environment, the Philippines cannot afford a weak, passive, denial-driven maritime governance model. The country’s role as the world’s premier provider of seafarers is not guaranteed. It is earned — and it can be lost. Memo 34 is a warning that the Philippines is drifting into irrelevance and vulnerability. It signals a government unwilling to engage with global realities and unprepared to meet its ILO obligations. If Manila continues down this path, foreign shipowners will eventually look elsewhere for talent—not out of bias, but out of necessity. And when that happens, no memo, no speech, and no political slogan will save a maritime legacy that took generations to build. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] DMW Advisory No. 34: How PH gov’t mishandles the maritime sector,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-dmw-advisory-34-seafarer-protection-failure/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Gokongwei family’s Universal Robina Corporation (URC) said it is repairing a collapsed portion of a lagoon that released around 255,000 cubic meters of molasses wastewater into Bais Bay in Negros Island which may affect the Tañon Strait Protected Seascape in the Visayas. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Monday, November 3, URC said 127 personnel and 20 Coast Guard members are repairing the collapsed section of its Bais Distillery’s 20-hectare pond. URC initially vowed to finish repairing the dike by Tuesday, November 4. However, it said in a statement on Wednesday, November 5, that it now aims to complete repairs by November 14 due to additional reinforcement work. “The recent typhoon did not affect the integrity of the main dike nor escalate the contamination of the seawater from the collapsed lagoon, though it did cause some delay in the completion of repair,” URC said. URC earlier said the repair work was “60% complete,” and that the new dike will be reinforced and strengthened by rubber tires and boulders. “Regarding the marine clean-up, we are in close coordination with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and other stakeholder agencies to deploy experts who will help contain the spilled wastewater within a limited area and guide the Company, local and other relevant authorities on how best to foster marine re-growth and recovery,” URC said on Monday. The settling pond’s collapse on Sunday, October 26, released contaminated wastewater that also reached the popular Majuyod white sandbar. The Negros Island Region’s Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) earlier issued an interim cease and desist order and a second notice of violation against the Gokongwei firm for illegal wastewater discharge. The EMB’s initial assessments found that 382.3 hectares of coastal and marine areas were affected by the spill. According to URC and the EMB, management reported cracks in the lagoon following aftershocks from the magnitude 6.9 and 7.4 earthquakes that struck Cebu and Davao Oriental on September 30 and October 10, respectively. The cracks then worsened due to the heavy rainfall on Saturday, October 25, and on succeeding days. The DENR said, in a statement on Saturday, November 1, that initial water quality assessments conducted by the DENR-Environment Management Bureau “indicate low levels of dissolved oxygen in affected waters, a condition that may cause fishkills and other adverse impacts on aquatic ecosystems.” The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Region 7 has issued an advisory prohibiting fishing and consumption of aquatic products from the affected areas. The DENR said it would conduct a review of URC’s Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) and other permits. “As warranted by law, the Department will initiate administrative, civil, and criminal proceedings against responsible parties,” the agency said. The Biodiversity Management Bureau, the DENR said, will undertake with experts the “economic valuation of environmental damages and assess long-term impacts on the Tañon Strait coastal and marine ecosystems.” The Tañon Strait Protected Seascape, which connects the Visayan Sea to the Bohol Sea, serves as a feeding and breeding ground for various marine species such as migratory whales and dolphins. URC told the local bourse that the company has temporarily ceased operations of the Bais Distillery. The distillery produces “high grade anhydrous ethanol for gasoline blending, using molasses which is a by-product in the manufacture of raw sugar from sugarcane as feedstock,” according to the company website. It has a capacity of 100,000 liters per day. “The company has been providing for the needs of the families affected by the spill and will continue to do so until the situation goes back to normal,” the manufacturer said. – Rappler.com",True,true,Universal Robina vows repair of lagoon after Bais wastewater spill,https://www.rappler.com/business/universal-robina-vows-repair-tailing-pond-bais-negros-oriental-molasses-spill/,Rappler
"The market is starting the year at the 6,052.92 level of the Philippine Stock Exchange index or PSEi. This starting point is also the best the market has achieved in 2025. Comparatively, it is 7.29% lower than the market’s 2024 trading close of 6,528.79, rendering 2025 as one of the most challenging years the bourse had ever experienced since the pandemic. This also ranked the market to be among the worst performing stock trading centers in East and Southeast Asia this year. (READ: Value trap: Why the PSE is one of world’s worst-performing markets) Nevertheless, average net value turnover for 2025 has improved to P5.91 billion per day from P5.15 billion in 2024. In hindsight, a mix of domestic issues and global economic shifts influenced the market’s poor performance. On top among the domestic issues is the flood control funds scandal. Investor trust and confidence was severely dented by the massive extent of corruption in the flood-control projects. The ongoing probes showed rampant misuse of billions of pesos allocated for flood management initiatives, discovery of “ghost” projects, rampant use of substandard construction materials and construction activities, and the alleged massive cornering of contracts by a small group of favored contractors working under some political personalities. This scandal drove down the market to a five-year low at 5,584.35 on November 14, 2025, the market’s lowest since its 5,570.22 close on May 28, 2020. (READ: Value trap: Why the PSE is one of world’s worst-performing markets) Investor confidence fell further after GDP grew by only 4% in the third quarter, the country’s slowest in more than four years. This also brought down the economy’s nine-month average to 5%, below the government 5.5-6.5% GDP growth target for the year. (READ: [In This Economy] When corruption drowns growth: The PH economy in 2025) As noted earlier, foreign investors were likewise persistent net sellers throughout the year, cashing out due to governance concerns at the same time lured by higher-performing regional peers. The net outflows of foreign investors reached P47.13 billion in 2025, 86.6% higher than their net outflows of P25.25-billion in 2024. Contributing further to the market’s soft performance is the volatility of the Philippine peso. It closed at P58.79 against the US dollar and hit the all-time low of P59.22. But towards the end of last year, the Philippines was awarded certain tariff exemptions on its agricultural products by the United States, boosting is chances for higher economic activity. In November, S&P Global gave the country a BBB+ credit rating on the following considerations: the country’s emerging strong economic recovery, effective fiscal policies, prudent actions by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) in keeping inflation low, ongoing reforms (like the Public-Private Partnership or PPP laws), and solid external position, which can potentially work for further upgrades as the country continues fiscal consolidation and reduces deficits, with expectations for continued high growth despite temporary slowdowns. This rating improved the market’s outlook. The rate cuts instituted in December by both the BSP and the US Federal Reserve further helped the market show signs of stabilization as it recovered from its low. However, its rebound was muted in the end due to lingering concerns on ”fiscal and political risks,” as expressed by most market analysts like Mark Angeles, the trading coach of First Metro Sec’s stock playbook. Amid the advice for a defensive play, this column is going ahead with the recommendation to buy Globe Telecom (GLO), a stock pick also found among the top 10 stocks favored by Angeles and his stockbrokerage house. Globe Telecom is an ideal investment essentially for its strong connectivity services, high dividend yields, and digital growth potential. As of late 2025, the company has transitioned from a traditional telecommunications provider into a company with significant interests in fintech, healthtech, and other digital solutions. In June 2025, Globe Telecom was recognized as the “Most Recommended Telco Brand” in the Philippines by SYNERGY/YouGov with its reportedly high performance in mobile video streaming, gaming, and voice apps. GLO is an outright winner on its 5G network in the following experience categories: premium perks through its postpaid “Platinum” plans that offer high-end lifestyle benefits, including international and local airport lounge access, 24/7 digital concierge services, and medical insurance. Globe’s GFiber plans provide high-speed home internet (up to 1.5 Gbps) bundled with entertainment subscriptions like Disney+ and 24/7 telehealth consultations via KonsultaMD. Conversely, Globe Telecom maintains a payout ratio of approximately 70% to 76% of its core net income, often maintaining a dividend yield between 5.42% and 5.8% per year. With its ownership in Mynt, the operator of GCash, Globe Telecom further stands out as an investment target. GCash is regarded as “the Philippines’ first US$5 billion Unicorn.” It dominates the cashless payment market with over six million partner merchants. The IPO of GCash will significantly contribute to Globe Telecom’s share valuation upswing. Globe Telecom has successfully pursued strategic diversification in other digital ventures like the telehealth platform KonsultaMD, 917Ventures a corporate venture builder for startups in adtech, e-commerce, and logistics. It has been expanding in data centers through its partnerships with ST Telemedia Global Data Centres and Ayala Corporation. Up to now, Globe Telecom remains to be the leading mobile network operator in the Philippines by subscriber base and market value. Globe Telecom is recognized for its sustainability practices, holding an “AA” rating from MSCI ESG Ratings and being a constituent of the FTSE4Good Index for nine consecutive years. Globe Telecom faces strong pressure from its main rival PLDT, which currently leads in the enterprise and fixed broadband sectors. Newer players like DITO have also challenged Globe Telecom’s speeds in some regions. Some analysts suggest Globe Telecom trades at a valuation premium due to its fintech assets, which can make the stock price sensitive to any changes in GCash’s growth trajectory. Globe Telecom is a compelling investment proposition: it’s a leader in the Philippine telecom industry, with strong brand and network and has successfully pivoted from a traditional telco to a tech-driven business, expanding its portfolio beyond connectivity. For one, its mobile wallet, GCash, is a major driver of digital financial services and revenue growth. In 2024, Globe Telecom achieved record revenues, maintaining strong EBITDA margins through cost-saving initiatives. Its management has been generously offering a competitive dividend yield, paying out a significant portion of earnings to shareholders. Finally, Globe Telecom is expected to thrive due to significant investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the growing need for efficient healthcare solutions, and global sustainability efforts, making it a balanced play for growth and income.

"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Tesla CEO Elon Musk scored a resounding victory on Thursday, November 6, as shareholders approved a pay package of as much as $878 billion over the next decade, endorsing his vision of morphing the EV maker into an AI and robotics juggernaut. The vote, analysts have said, is a positive for Tesla’s stock, whose valuation hangs on Musk’s vision of making vehicles drive themselves, expanding robotaxis across the US and selling humanoid robots, even though his far-right political rhetoric has hurt the Tesla brand this year. A win for Musk was widely expected as the billionaire was allowed to exercise the full voting rights of his roughly 15% stake after the automaker moved to Texas from Delaware, where a legal challenge has held up a previous pay rise. The approval comes even after opposition from some major investors, including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund. Tesla’s board had said Musk could quit if the pay package was not approved. The vote will also allay investor concern that Musk’s focus has been diluted with his work in politics as well as in running his other companies, including rocket maker SpaceX and artificial intelligence startup xAI. The board and many investors who lent their endorsement have said the nearly $1 trillion package benefits shareholders in the longer run as Musk must ensure Tesla achieves a series of milestones to get paid. Goals for Musk over the next decade include the company’s delivering 20 million vehicles, having 1 million robotaxis in operation, selling 1 million robots, and earning as much as $400 billion in core profit. But in order for him to get paid, Tesla’s stock value has to rise in tandem, first to $2 trillion from the current $1.5 trillion, and all the way to $8.5 trillion. Under the new plan, Musk could earn as much as $878 billion in Tesla stock over 10 years. Musk would be given as much as $1 trillion in stock but would have to make some payments back to Tesla. – Rappler.com",True,true,Tesla shareholders approve $878-billion pay plan for Elon Musk,https://www.rappler.com/technology/tesla-shareholders-approve-elon-musk-pay-plan/,Rappler
"Imagine we have to pay the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines or NGCP for projects proposed but we don’t get a rebate of payments for projects not completed. We are also expected to be grateful for lower-rate adjustments like what was announced recently but never given the chance to be heard about our objections against higher transmission charges resulting from grand investment plans that look more like a strategy of increasing the sheer amount of corporate profits limited by the income cap it is mandated to earn. NGCP also continues to disappoint for results that are far from the claimed benefits envisioned by the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 or EPIRA: over the years since it took over operation of the national power grid in 2009, NGCP has had more excuses than results to show in actually responding to the consuming public’s continuing complaints over power outages and low power supply. But what horribly stands out at the moment is the fragile situation of the country’s power grid against potential manipulation and sabotage from the outside by a foreign force — especially to one the Philippines has existing territorial and geopolitical disputes. This is not a remote possibility with the increasing tensions we have with China in the West Philippine Sea. Like what China has been doing to us all along, another deliberate harassment occurred last October 12: a Chinese coastguard vessel identified as CCG 21559 rammed our BRP Datu Pagbuaya’s stern while near Pag-asa island helping our fisherfolks. PCG and BFAR Stand Firm Against Chinese Bullying and Aggressive Actions in Pag-asaThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) have reaffirmed their strong commitment to protecting Filipino fishermen in the Kalayaan Island Group,… pic.twitter.com/okA55L9oWs Not to mention also the countless harassments China has launched against us since it treacherously stole Bajo de Masinloc or Scarborough Reef in 2012, this latest wanton act of impunity is not just simply a figment of the mind but as a stark reminder and reality that our national security has always been in constant danger of being compromised — paradoxically — by NGCP’s partner, China: This is the national security issue they don’t want us to talk about. NGCP maintains that its operation complies with our domestic ownership laws. In reality, a Chinese state-linked entity is holding significant control over the country’s electrical heart: NGCP has been relying heavily on Chinese technology in the operation of the grid. It is using the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system supplied by the NARI Group Corporation, a Chinese IT infrastructure provider. Worse, the government has limited oversight powers over the facilities. The National Transmission Corporation or TransCo is the owner of the grid infrastructure while NGCP is only the appointed “house caretaker” or “taong bahay” in our local dialect. Yet, the TransCo is barred from inspecting NGCP’s operations. How on earth could this be? How can a house caretaker have more say over the owner of the house? This situation certainly poses a clear and present danger to Philippine sovereignty and energy security. Our power grid is not merely a piece of economic infrastructure. It is the central nervous system of the country. Its safety and stability are synonymous with economic functionality, public safety, and, ultimately, national security. NGCP’s ownership structure includes a 40% stake held by the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) — a China state-owned enterprise. And believe it or not, out of its 14 board members, which include four Chinese directors, NGCP’s board is chaired by a Chinese representative despite China’s minority position. This surely creates a profound and unacceptable vulnerability. SGCC is not a conventional private investor. It is an extension of a foreign government, bound by its domestic laws to serve the interests of that state, which includes intelligence gathering and compliance with its strategic directives. The Philippine grid has been using the Chinese-made SCADA systems and other specialized hardware. If control or even deep technical access to these systems is shared or can be leveraged by the minority partner, the physical grid becomes a geopolitical weapon. A targeted cyber-attack or pre-programmed vulnerability could lead to a systemic, nationwide blackout during a moment of great tension as in a hotly contested presidential election, a military mobilization, or a crisis in the West Philippine Sea. The economic damage and social chaos resulting from such an act would be catastrophic, effectively disabling the nation without a shot being fired. Beyond outright sabotage, the concentration of technical knowledge and operational influence in Chinese hands creates a continuous risk of intelligence leakage and operational dependence. The NGCP’s operational data like the consumption patterns of military bases, key industrial facilities, and government centers is sensitive information that we can’t allow to be leaked or handed down to a foreign power. Even if Filipino personnel perform the day-to-day operations, the involvement of Chinese nationals in key technical positions, including various high-ranking technical offices, suggests control beyond mere advisory roles. This placement allows for intimate knowledge of the grid’s weak points, maintenance schedules, and security protocols, information that could be invaluable to a rival power. Furthermore, if the proprietary technical manuals and advanced troubleshooting expertise are primarily held by NGCP’s Chinese partners, the country becomes perpetually dependent on an external entity to ensure the grid’s functioning, severely limiting the nation’s capacity for independent operation and maintenance. NGCP insists that there is “no single button” to shut down the grid. This defense misses the forest for the trees, as the concern is beyond the simple question of as to how the grid’s switch is turned on or off. It is the far more insidious ability to create cascading failures, disrupt specific regional activities, or introduce chronic instability in the whole country. The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) and TransCo have the mandate to regulate, yet its oversight capabilities are demonstrably hampered by the confidentiality surrounding the shareholders’ agreement and the highly technical nature of the grid’s core systems. Under the guise of improving efficiency and innovation by supposedly leveraging on the private sector’s management expertise and strong motivation as a compelling reason for the creation of the NGCP to operate the country’s power grid, the idea was but an anomaly from the beginning. At the time it was hatched, the experience in over two decades of privatization by over 100 countries who jumped into the bandwagon showed that it was not at all the silver bullet that everyone thought it would be to deliver desired national development, productivity and security: it was, after all, not a universally applicable solution. It carried significant risks and presented many downsides to a country’s wellbeing. Yet, when the idea was forced into play just before the end of President Gloria Arroyo’s term, it leaves one to wonder how our government economic managers then were quizzically clueless to the growing findings worldwide at the time. The result: a plethora of contradictions inimical to the interest of the people. It’s time for the government to take decisive action on the power grid’s existential considerations. It’s time for Congress to revive its past initiative in the 19th Congress to revisit this flawed franchise given to NGCP. Congress should now move to modify — even to the extent of scrapping — NGCP’s franchise if our national security is at constant risk. Congress should also insist now in forcing the disclosure of the controversial confidential shareholders’ agreement that serves to always stop the government from its tracks to insist its oversight rights on NGCP’s operation and technology use of the grid’s core systems. Critical infrastructure that forms the lifeblood of the nation cannot be left exposed to the strategic interests of any foreign power, especially like China with whom the country has current territorial and geopolitical disagreements. The power grid must be fully safeguarded, ensuring that the control of the nation’s electrical heart remain firmly in our own hands. – Rappler.com (You may reach the writer at densomera@yahoo.com)",True,true,[OPINION] NGCP’s vulnerability: The national security risk they don’t want us to talk about,https://www.rappler.com/business/opinion-national-grid-philippines-security-risk-china-control/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) further trimmed the country’s economic growth targets for the remainder of the Marcos Jr. administration as the economy continues to reel from the effects of the flood control corruption scandal. During a Malacañang press briefing on Monday, January 5, Department of Economy, Planning and Development (DEPDev) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said the P6.793-trillion 2026 national budget will be able to help grow the Philippine economy by 5% to 6%. This is lower than the DBCC’s earlier target of 6% to 7%. Balisacan also said the economy is expected to grow 5.5% to 6.5% in 2027 and 6% to 7% in 2028, lower than the DBCC’s projected 6% to 8% growth for both years. The adjustments were made during the DBCC’s meeting in December 2025. The DEPDev chief cited the effects of global trade uncertainties and the public works corruption scandal on the Philippine economy. Uncovered corruption in flood control projects caused government infrastructure spending to tumble to a 14-year low in the third quarter of 2025 as the Department of Public Works and Highways implemented stricter validation measures. Corruption concerns also tempered business and consumer confidence as Filipinos held back on purchasing durable goods. The Philippine economy grew just 4% in the third quarter, with average growth for 2025 at just 5%. Balisacan said they expect the economy to have grown just 4.8% to 5% last year. Balisacan also explained that the economy will continue to feel the effects of the diminished trust in governance this year, with growth expected to rebound in the second half. “We expect growth perhaps in the first quarter to be or at least in the first half [of 2026] to be still quite not as rosy as we would want it to be. But I think that with the improvements in the systems that we are putting in place as reflected in the budget and in the various offices, we expect to see faster growth toward the second half and the succeeding years,” the country’s chief economist explained.

"MANILA, Philippines – Following a disappointing third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) of 4%, what should the Marcos administration do in the coming months? If you ask the president of the Philippines’ largest mall developer and operator, the government’s plan to focus spending on social services for the rest of the year is a welcome development. “If you look at what happened in the last month or so, obviously because of the challenges and the scandals that have happened, government has actually, in a way, stopped infrastructure spending,” said Jeffrey Lim, president of SM Prime Holdings, in a press briefing on Monday, November 10, on the conglomerate’s third quarter earnings. “And I think, given that they’ll probably shift their spending priorities into social services than infrastructure, we hope that Q4 will be better for consumer spending as they would disburse more in the fourth quarter.” Led by its malls business, SM Prime reported an 8% year-on-year increase in its third-quarter net income to P12.8 billion from P11.8 billion. This lifted its nine-month profit to P37.2 billion, up 10% from P33.9 billion a year earlier. Together with steady inflation and lower interest rates, Lim said the government’s spending strategy “would create an environment where consumer spending will be better in November and in the [Christmas] holidays and into 2026.” The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) announced last week that it plans to spend around P1.3 trillion, mostly in social services, in the last quarter of 2025, amid the big drop in government construction spending. The 4% third-quarter GDP translates to a 5% GDP in the first nine months of 2025, which means the government will likely miss its GDP target of 5.5 to 6.5% in 2025. “Our programmed spending for the fourth quarter will boost year-end economic growth and thus impact overall economic growth for the year,” said Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman, in a press statement last Thursday, November 6. Among the priority social services in the last quarter, according to the DBM, are the following: Disaster aid Social welfare Agriculture Education Labor Health Year-end benefits The DBM said that as of October 27, it had already released Notices of Cash Allocations amounting to P1.13 trillion of the P1.3 trillion program for the fourth quarter of 2025. “I urge all departments and agencies — gamitin natin ang budget, gastusin nang tama at siguruhing makakarating sa ating mga kababayan (use the budget, spend it correctly, and make sure it reaches our people),” Pangandaman said. Meantime, Joey Salceda, a former Albay representative and a former economic adviser to several presidents, suggested in a research paper last Friday, November 7, that if the Marcos government puts the brakes on infrastructure spending, it “must compensate through aid,” especially in light of the series of natural disasters the country has had to deal with. “When people see billions for flood control while communities remain flooded, they demand accountability. But if pursuing accountability freezes infrastructure, we must keep money flowing another way,” he said. “The P100 billion sitting idle could be redirected to disaster response.” Salceda, however, said disaster assistance should just be a temporary measure, and that the government should still pursue infrastructure projects because if all public works are stopped out of caution, “the public pays twice: once for corruption, again for paralysis.” “The gap between Q3 2024’s 12.8% investment growth and Q3 2025’s negative 2.8% represents lost development momentum. The human cost is starker: the difference between consensus 5.4% growth and actual 4% means 200,000 to 250,000 Filipinos remain in poverty who otherwise would have escaped it,” he said. Salceda said the government should determine “which [infrastructure] projects may proceed, which are under review, which are suspended.” “A safe harbor policy will provide a sense of assurance for officials who just want to do their jobs. By making clear what conditions are required so that a project is not considered suspect, things can move. Cases with credible irregularities should be suspended specifically, not systemically,” he said. Salceda urged Public Works and Highways Secretary Vince Dizon to “make the rules clearer so that the clean [DPWH personnel] can proceed with the rules on their side.” “Instead, for example, of treating FLR projects as entirely suspect, rules can be made clear so that their release is conditional on readiness to implement and accountability of implementation,” he said. – Rappler.com",True,true,What Marcos administration can do to arrest slower economic growth in 2025,https://www.rappler.com/business/marcos-administration-spending-trillion-peso-fourth-quarter-2025/,Rappler

"MANILA, Philippines — Tombstones filled the Boy Scout Circle in Quezon City on Tuesday, October 28, as several advocacy groups called for the implementation of higher excise taxes on alcohol. The tombstones, written with anti-alcohol statements, stood for the 47 Filipinos who die every day due to alcohol-related causes. Representatives from various youth and community groups, including the Sin Tax Coalition, 1Tahanan Partylist, and the Action for Economic Reforms (AER) participated in the activity. According to the 2023 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), 17,088 Filipinos died from alcohol-related causes, translating to approximately 47 deaths per day and two deaths per hour. About 2.58% of all deaths in the country are attributed to alcohol consumption, including car crashes and alcohol-related illnesses and injuries. Similarly, 9.24% or 2,668 cancer deaths in the Philippines are also linked to alcohol. These include liver cancer (1,205), as well as colon and rectal cancer (546). Based on the GBD data, alcohol-related costs — including government and private spending on healthcare and productivity losses — to the economy was at P256.2 billion in 2023. However, the government only collected P108.2 billion in excise taxes on alcohol that year. Youth leader and University of the Philippines student Gwyneth Barra believed that high consumption and easy access to alcoholic products is a social cost that often results in an inefficient distribution of goods in the market, economically referred to as market failure. The sin tax law seeks to address this market failure by making alcoholic products more expensive and less accessible, especially to the youth. “It could be said that only the poor will be affected by this, but in the long run they will also be the beneficiaries because this tax will go to the development of health programs that they could benefit from,” she said. Under Republic Act 11467 or the sin tax law, alcohol taxes should be allocated to the following: Advocates assert that raising alcohol taxes would not only curb consumption and save lives but also strengthen public health financing. A large portion of alcohol tax revenues supports PhilHealth and medical assistance programs for low-income Filipinos. They believe that as alcoholic products become less accessible, those most affected by it will benefit from expanded healthcare services. AER legislative officer Paul Roset also pointed out that the Philippines’ excise duties on alcohol remain considerably lower than others in Southeast Asia. “Our proposal is to have a 25% or P9 increase in taxes for distilled spirits or gins which the masses commonly consume. A 10% increase for fermented liquor or beers. Alcopops or flavored alcohol beverages should also be taxed as fermented liquors,” said Roset. In 2024, the revenue target for excise tax on alcoholic beverages was P117.16 billion, while the total revenue collected reached P116.12 billion, falling short of about P1.04 billion. Beginning 2025, the specific excise tax per liter of distilled spirits, wines, and fermented liquor are mandated to increase by 6% annually. The national government aims to collect P4.6 trillion in tax revenues for 2026, with P132 billion coming from excess levies on alcohol products. This is an 8% increase from its current P122-billion target for 2025. Filomeno Sta. Ana, co-founder of AER, suggests increasing sin taxes on alcohol and tobacco products to help the government address the deficit. –Arriane dela Cruz/Rappler.com Arriane dela Cruz is a Rappler intern.

"MANILA, Philippines – The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has temporarily suspended all its field audits and related operations following calls to investigate an alleged extortion scheme within the agency. BIR Commissioner Charlie Mendoza, in a statement on Monday, November 24, said that the suspension covers the issuance of Letters of Authority (LOAs) and Mission Orders (MOs). LOAs are formal documents that authorize BIR revenue officers to examine a taxpayer’s books of accounts and records for a designated period. Meanwhile, MOs authorize revenue officers to conduct surveillance and inventory-taking activities on business operations. Mendoza said that exceptions will only be given to cases such as active criminal investigations, refund claims that require audits, and immediate action that has been flagged by verified intelligence. The newly appointed tax commissioner described the suspension as a necessary move to protect taxpayers’ rights and strengthen the BIR’s internal processes. Mendoza said he has instructed the creation of a technical working group to evaluate the BIR’s existing procedures and recommend revised LOA protocols. “We take every complaint seriously, and any misuse of authority, harassment, or irregularity has no place in the Bureau,” Mendoza said. Department of Finance Secretary Frederick Go for his part renewed his agency’s commitment to protecting taxpayers from abuse. “All taxpayers shall be treated with the highest degree of professionalism, courtesy, and adherence to the rule of law,” he said. The suspension came just hours after Senator Erwin Tulfo filed a Senate resolution directing the blue ribbon committee to probe the BIR’s alleged extortion scheme involving LOAs. Tulfo said some business owners approached him and other senators, claiming BIR personnel used LOAs to pressure them into “discounted” rates in order to avoid an inflated assessment of their due taxes. The senator also flagged supposed irregularities such as the repeated issuance of LOAs, the use of fake or unauthorized LOAs, and the substitution of MOs to evade scrutiny. He also alleged that the agency’s personnel resorted to this scheme in order to meet the BIR’s collection targets. While Tulfo welcomed the BIR’s suspension, he said the involved tax officials and personnel must still be held accountable for their actions. “I urge the new commissioner to do a reshuffle because from the complaints we received, the regional directors may have a hand in this,” he said. – Rappler.com",True,true,BIR suspends field audits amid calls to probe alleged extortion scheme,https://www.rappler.com/business/bureau-internal-revenue-suspends-field-audits-alleged-extortion-scheme-probe/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Villar Land reported a P1.423-billion profit in 2024, relatively flat from its P1.416-billion net income in 2023. The controversial real estate firm of tycoon Manny Villar finally submitted its audited 2024 annual report to regulators on Thursday, November 13, after missing the deadline in May, leading the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) to suspend trading of its shares. According to its 2024 annual report, Villar Land’s bottomline stayed relatively flat due to weaker sales. “Real estate sales decreased by 26% from [P4.45 billion] for the year ended December 31, 2023 to [P3.3 billion] for the year ended December 31, 2024, due to the decrease in sales,” the company said. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently investigating Villar Land for supposedly misleading investors by publicizing its unaudited financial statements back in March through a board resolution. In the previous version of the earnings report, Villar Land made around P999 billion due to fair value gains from acquiring 400 hectares within its Villar City development in Cavite and Metro Manila from three other Villar-owned firms. The newly acquired properties were valued at P1.34 trillion. (READ: How did Manny Villar reclaim the title of richest Filipino?) Villar Land’s external auditors Punongbayan & Araullo did not accept the trillion-peso valuation, and requested for another appraisal of the properties. To expedite the release of its 2024 audited earnings report, Villar Land said it will instead value the land at cost-basis or the cost it paid to acquire the properties. “We want to highlight that while the company believes that it is the fair value of the Villar City properties that should be reflected in its financial statements, in the interest of securing the immediate release of the 2024 Audited Financial Statements, it reluctantly proposed to the external auditors the use of cost basis in recording its said properties,” Villar Land said in an earlier statement. The SEC has fined Villar Land’s directors, which include senators Camille Villar and Mark Villar, P12 million for the months-long delay in its report submission. It also ordered the appraiser of the Villar Land properties, E-Value Philippines Incorporated, to explain its P1.34-trillion appraisal of the land. In the first six months of 2025, Villar Land’s profit dropped 28% to just P557.5 million. Villar Land wrote in a disclosure to the PSE on Wednesday, November 12, that its topline continued to drop in double-digits, with its six-month revenues plunging 28% to just P1.7 billion. The Villar-owned developer attributed this to the continuous drop in real estate sales to just P1.7 billion from P2.3 billion in the same period in 2024. “This is due to the decrease in sales for the period as the Company is shifting its strategy to focus on expanding its real estate development footprint as the master developer of Villar City, supported by the recent acquisition of approximately 366 hectares within the Villar City masterplan,” it wrote. Its interest income on contract receivables also dipped 21% to just P55.4 million amid lower in-house financed sales. Growth in its interment income, however, cushioned the topline as it climbed 6% to P46.9 million. – Rappler.com",True,true,"From P999-B profit, Villar Land’s 2024 net income flat amid dipping sales",https://www.rappler.com/business/villar-land-earnings-report-2024-h1-2025/,Rappler
"Claim: Former president Rodrigo Duterte has been released from the custody of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and is set to spend Christmas in the Philippines. Why we fact-checked this: The YouTube video containing the claim has 37,000 views, 2,900 likes, and 444 comments as of writing. It was uploaded on a YouTube channel claiming to be a news outlet, which has 168,000 subscribers. The video claims that Duterte’s release has been confirmed and that he will spend Christmas in the Philippines. It also alleges that the media withheld this information from the public and asserts that the Supreme Court has already issued an ultimatum for his release. The title in the video states: “Sa wakas! Kumpirmado na, tatay Digong makakalaya na? Supreme Court matinding utos, bring FPRRD home!“ (Finally! It’s confirmed! Father Digong will be freed! The Supreme Court has issued a strong order to bring him home!) The facts: Duterte has not been released by the ICC. He remains in detention at the ICC Detention Centre in Scheveningen Prison, The Hague, after the ICC Appeals Chamber unanimously denied his request for interim release on November 28, 2025. There are no credible reports confirming his release because no such release has occurred. Claims that the Philippine Supreme Court has issued an “ultimatum” for his release are also false as Philippine courts have no jurisdiction over ICC custody or proceedings and cannot order, compel, or interfere with ICC detention decisions. As an “independent and impartial judicial institution” established under the Rome Statute, the ICC’s detention orders cannot be overturned or interfered with by any domestic body. The ICC has repeatedly stated that it will continue its work “independently and impartially, undeterred by external pressure,” and that all decisions are governed solely by the Rome Statute. Jurisdiction issues: The ICC has asked the prosecution and victims’ lawyers to provide additional explanations on its jurisdiction over Duterte in the ongoing crimes against humanity case. In a December 16, 2025 order, the Appeals Chamber directed the parties to submit “additional observations” by January 16, focusing on how Articles 12(2), 13(c), and 127 of the Rome Statute interact. Article 12 sets the preconditions for the ICC’s exercise of jurisdiction, Article 13 defines when the court may assert jurisdiction, and Article 127 outlines a state’s continuing obligations even after leaving the ICC. The defense must submit its response by January 23, five working days after the other parties’ deadline. This directive follows the defense’s November 14 appeal challenging the court’s jurisdiction, which comes after the Pre-Trial Chamber’s October 23 ruling affirming the ICC’s authority to prosecute and detain Duterte. – Marjuice Destinado/Rappler.com Marjuice Destinado is a senior political science student at Cebu Normal University and an alumna of the Aries Rufo Journalism Fellowship of Rappler for 2025.

"Not only are local governments and water districts terminating or preparing to terminate their joint venture agreements with the Villars’ PrimeWater, but subcontractors are also lining up over unpaid bills, Rappler has learned. We obtained documents of a subcontractor trying to collect P75 million worth of overdue bills from PrimeWater, which cover different works for several water districts that went into a joint venture partnership with PrimeWater. This subcontractor, who requested anonymity, is not alone. Rappler also obtained a billing from private firm Bacolod Bulk Water Inc (BBWI), trying to collect P7.9 million in outstanding payments from PrimeWater due on Friday, December 12. The billing covers unpaid obligations from August 1 to October 31. Senator Raffy Tulfo, chairperson of the public works committee which has begun investigating PrimeWater, said a contractor had relayed similar problems. “We also received a complaint from a contractor providing non-revenue water and maintenance services across multiple PrimeWater sites nationwide. They’re seeking assistance for their uncollected billings amounting to more than P90 million overdue since March 2023,” Tulfo said on December 3. PrimeWater, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prime Asset owned by Manuel Paolo Villar, is under multiple investigations for allegedly defaulting on their obligations to the water districts. Rappler had earlier reported on the suffering of their consumers under agreements that were allegedly faulty from the start. PrimeWater grew exponentially under the Duterte administration, when Manuel Paolo’s brother, Senator Mark Villar, was the Department of Public Works and Highways secretary. The Local Water Utilities Administration or LWUA, which oversees water districts, is an agency attached to the DPWH, a conflict of interest for Mark Villar. Rappler emailed and sent a Viber message to Prime Asset’s communication officer on December 8 and 9, but we have yet to receive a response. We will update this story if and when we get a response. Rappler was able to speak with the contractor who said the total outstanding payable has actually reached P150 million. The source said PrimeWater subcontracts its construction work to their own firm, MGS construction, which then subcontracts to other companies including theirs, the source said. MGS Construction is owned by Villar associate Jerry Navarrete. The source said the difficulty collecting payment from PrimeWater began in 2023, which was also the time that the management kept changing, the source added. PrimeWater, we were told, has offered payment plan alternatives, such as paying with a lot property. The latest payment plan offer, the source said, was for Allbank — a thrift bank of the Villar group — to extend their credit lines. That way, the subcontractor can finance the project through Allbank loans, in lieu of their own financing if only PrimeWater had paid diligently. The billings obtained by Rappler show that the subcontractor was also collecting P4 million from paying interest on the Allbank loans. The source said that while PrimeWater offered to be the guarantor on the loan, they also could not pay the interest afterwards, forcing them to shoulder the interest charges in the meantime so they could “make further drawbacks in the loan.” The source said they have had to retrench 10 employees because of the financial difficulty caused by PrimeWater. “If this continues in the next two months, we might have the tendency to fold the business,” the source added. On the request of the source, we are not disclosing the nature of the subcontracts and the water districts. But these are subcontracts for as low as P5 million to as high as P90 million. Yet PrimeWater still reported a P1.35-billion comprehensive income in their 2024 financial statement. Their assets were worth P40.5 billion. “Napaisip po tayo kung kaya ‘nyong kumita ng bilyon, bakit hindi ‘nyo po kayang maglabas para sa sahod at bayarin sa mga contractors?” said Tulfo. (I wondered why if you can earn a billion, why can’t you spend for the salary and payables to contractors?) Renee Co, representative of Kabataan Partylist and a lawyer, said there should be a criminal investigation into “what may be considered fraud and bad-faith business practice.” Co and the progressive Makabayan bloc has been pushing to terminate all PrimeWater joint venture agreements in their cause to stop privatization of a public service. We checked the audit reports of the water districts where the source worked and found that PrimeWater had also run into financial troubles in these areas. In one water district, PrimeWater allegedly did not pay the taxes that they’re supposed to shoulder under their contract, and did not increase the profit share of the water district even though the latter chipped in for the repairs. In another water district, PrimeWater allegedly did not pay for manpower, labor, and equipment even if the contract stipulates it to be their responsibility. In two water districts, PrimeWater allegedly also did not fulfill the investments they committed to under the joint venture. Tulfo questioned PrimeWater over this same issue during a September 25 hearing, as several other water districts complained that the Villar company did not actually implement what they promised to do under their capital expenditures (capex). Capital expenditure refers to funds used to buy, upgrade, or maintain long-term assets. Capex is important because this is what will enable PrimeWater to increase charges on consumers. If PrimeWater builds and expands facilities under capex, they can then go to the regulators to justify increasing their charges. PrimeWater consumers have complained about high charges, but no actual water supply. “It goes on and on and on, halos lahat (almost all), ang dami nang nag-terminate ng contract because of that (so many have terminated contracts because of that),” said Tulfo, meaning, that almost all partner water districts were found by auditors to have capex shortcoming by PrimeWater. “Pikit-mata pumayag sila kasi ang ganda ng offer ‘nyo, gaganda nga ang service kung ganito, half a billion ang i-iinfuse ‘nyong capital. Sino ba naman ang local water district na hindi papayag pero nabudol sila, ang dami ‘nyo pong nabudol,” said Tulfo. (The water districts agreed blindly because your offers were so good, service will really improve if you were going to infuse half a billion in capital. No water district will say no to this, but they were fooled, you fooled so many.) PrimeWater president Roberto Fabrique disputed a figure for one water district, but this did not satisfy Tulfo who was reading off a Commission on Audit (COA) report. “This is a breach of contract…the water district can get the bond, or ask PrimeWater to comply, or pre-terminate if they don’t want [it] anymore,” said Assistant Government Corporate Counsel Tricia Velasco-Catera. Collecting performance bonds from PrimeWater, however, has also been a challenge for water districts. Rappler’s research has found that 41 water districts out of the 77 PrimeWater partners have failed to forfeit performance bonds, including the water district that the source subcontracted for. This means they have not pursued their rightful claims. One of the water districts representative told the Senate that they couldn’t collect the bonds from the insurance company without PrimeWater’s consent. The Insurance Commission suggested mediation, or filing for a claim. Some water districts or local governments have resorted to termination of the contract, but when that happens, PrimeWater always just runs to the courts. “More often than not, the TRO is granted,” said Tulfo. That’s what happened in La Union. There’s a local win in San Fernando, Pampanga when Mayor Vilma Caluag unilaterally suspended PrimeWater’s business permit. PrimeWater sought a temporary restraining order from the court. A San Fernando, Pampanga Regional Trial Court denied the TRO on December 2. According to Tulfo, half of the 77 partner water districts have either unilaterally terminated the agreement, or issued a pre-termination notice. “The suggestion is don’t go to court, if the joint venture is canceled, don’t go to court, can you do that?” Tulfo asked PrimeWater during the December 3 hearing. “With all due respect, I cannot decide on that,” said Fabrique. In Bacolod, when PrimeWater partnered with the water district, the Villar firm just assumed existing subcontracts from private extraction firms such as BBWI, according to Councilor Wilson Gamboa Jr. He has been pushing to get rid of PrimeWater which “did not bring a drop of water to Bacolod,” Gamboa told Rappler in a phone interview on Friday. BBWI had sent a notice of disconnection to PrimeWater, but Gamboa — who is in contact with the water district — said there are ongoing negotiations so that BBWI does not disconnect “for general welfare.” Gamboa said the city council is trying to issue a resolution to push Mayor Greg Gasataya to issue a show cause order to PrimeWater, as a leadup to suspending the mayor’s business permit. PrimeWater made a commitment to pay to BBWI on December 13, two days after Rappler published its first report, and a day after the disconnection deadline, averting a major water crisis in the city. Gamboa, who is part of a pending petition in the Supreme Court against PrimeWater, said the revocation of a mayor’s business permit might be the most viable option. “We have two options, to bring it to the proper court, which is a protracted, long, tedious and expensive litigation, and settlements. Or business cancelation. We are looking at option two,” said Gamboa. Co said criminal complaints must be initiated soon, as termination proceedings “take years” and the Malacañang-mandated LWUA investigation is “often slow and politically pressured.” “Without criminal cases, what is happening is only damage control, not real justice. The state ends up merely ‘regulating’ the abuse instead of actively defending the public and holding powerful corporations accountable,” said Co. – with research from Shay Du/Rappler.com",True,true,"PrimeWater allegedly not paying contractors, water districts: ‘Dami ’nyong nabudol’",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/villar-primewater-also-not-paying-subcontractors/,Rappler
"Anthropic, the artificial intelligence startup backed by Alphabet’s Google and Amazon.com, has hired the law firm Wilson Sonsini to prepare for an initial public offering that could take place as early as 2026, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, December 2. An IPO would give the company, which operates the AI chatbot Claude, a more efficient way to raise capital and provide leverage for bigger acquisitions through public stock. The move comes as AI adoption gains pace, driven by higher enterprise tech spending and growing investor appetite. An Anthropic spokesperson told Reuters the company has not decided when or even if it will go public. The company has previously turned to Wilson Sonsini for a range of corporate matters. The law firm did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment on the FT report outside normal business hours. Anthropic could be prepared to list in 2026, according to the report. The startup has also discussed with major investment banks about a potential IPO, the newspaper said, citing sources. The FT report said, however, that the talks are in early stages and informal, indicating the company is still far from selecting its IPO underwriters. Anthropic is negotiating a private funding round that could give the startup a valuation exceeding $300 billion, the report added. Dario Amodei-led Anthropic is projecting to more than double and potentially nearly triple its annualized revenue run rate to around $26 billion next year. It has more than 300,000 business and enterprise customers. Microsoft-backed OpenAI, a major rival, is preparing for what could rank among the largest IPO ever, with a potential valuation of up to $1 trillion. The firm is laying the groundwork to go public and may file with securities regulators as early as the second half of 2026, Reuters has reported. OpenAI’s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, said later in November that a listing is not in the startup’s near-term plans. Last month, Microsoft and Nvidia announced plans to invest up to $15 billion in Anthropic as the AI firm made a $30 billion commitment to use Microsoft’s cloud services.

On Monday, October 13, Del Rosario said in an interview on the One News business show Money Talks that Marcos cannot wash his hands of responsibility in what has been described as the worst budget in Philippine history. It saw P289 billion in net insertions by Congress in the 2025 Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) budget, of which only P26 billion was vetoed by Marcos. (Figures are from the People’s Budget Coalition’s analysis of the 2025 and 2026 national budgets.) “I’m sorry to say, even the President, when he said, ‘Mahiya naman kayo,’ (Shame on you), that’s a little strange for him to say because it was his budget to start with. And he should have been aware of what was going on, and he had the opportunity to veto a lot of these things,” Del Rosario said, referring to Marcos’ statements in his fourth State of the Nation Address last July. In his speech, Marcos exposed corruption in poorly done flood control projects. If he was not aware of what was going on, Del Rosario said “it should have been brought to his attention by the DBM [Department of Budget and Management] and the different department secretaries whose budgets had been mangled.” This way, Marcos “could have acted on it at least with full information,” and “if he did not have the information, his department secretaries were not doing their job,” he said. Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman has tried to distance herself from the mangled budget by saying she had no role in the National Expenditure Program revisions. The NEP, also called the President’s budget, is prepared by the DBM and submitted to Congress for review. Del Rosario, now a co-convenor of a multisectoral group called Roundtable for Inclusive Development, said corruption in flood control and other public works projects got bigger and bigger because of “greed” and because the checks against corruption failed. “More and more, it became a system where everyone was in on it. The way they did it was there was something for everyone: the congressmen, the senators would connive with the executive branch so that there were percentages given to everyone along the way, all the way, including the contractors. “And that’s the system that evolved, and because everyone was getting a share of it, everyone decided to be tight-lipped and it just grew and grew and grew, until it became the monster that it now is. And now everybody is saying, how did this happen? It happened because people let it happen.” The way forward, Del Rosario said, is to make sure those responsible are held accountable, especially the “big fish.” “You cannot get away with all of this and think that you can get it done by just going after district engineers…. You have to go beyond that, you’ve got to go to legislators, very senior people,” he said. Based on their conversations with people in the executive and legislative branches of government, Del Rosario said he believes “a growing number of them sincerely want to do the right thing,” although “some are in a defensive mode” because some forces are “exploiting the situation.” “But we’re being very clear about our position: stick to the Constitution, let’s not fool around with extra-constitutional ideas all over again. Let’s make our democracy work, is what we’re saying,” he said. He said the more than 20 organizations and 100 individuals in the People’s Budget Coalition, are demanding that the Marcos administration make sure that the 2026 budget is “in no way a repeat of 2025.” Based on the analysis by the People’s Budget Coalition of the 2026 budget, Del Rosario said it still had around P230 billion for pork barrel that will go to social programs that “make it sound like they’re highly needed.” He said the money should instead be allocated to the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program or 4Ps, which has very specific guidelines where beneficiaries are entitled to certain amounts based on certain school attendance and nutrition conditions. Del Rosario warned that the people’s anger will continue unless those in power “show serious intent to change things.” “I think we’ve got to wake up as a people and say we deserve better than this.” Del Rosario is chairman and CEO of conglomerate PHINMA Corporation, which is involved in education, construction, hospitality, energy, and housing. He served briefly as finance secretary from 1992 to 1993 during the Fidel Ramos administration. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Marcos, DBM can’t wash hands of ‘mangled’ 2025 budget – ex-finance chief",https://www.rappler.com/business/marcos-jr-dbm-responsible-mangled-2025-budget-ramon-del-rosario/,Rappler
"(This is a press release from the Manila Electric Company.) MANILA, Philippines – After a P0.1852 per kilowatt hour (kWh) reduction last month, the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) announced on Monday, October 15, an upward adjustment of P0.2331 per kWh for October. This brings the overall rate for a typical household to P13.3182 per kWh this month from P13.0851 per kWh. For residential customers consuming 200 kWh, the adjustment is equivalent to an additional P47 in their total electricity bill. Coming from a P0.2603 per kWh reduction last month, the October generation charge went up by P0.1903 per kWh. Charges from Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and Power Supply Agreements (PSAs) increased by P0.3622 and P0.3567 per kWh, respectively, primarily due to the depreciation of the local currency against the US dollar, which affected 99% and 48% of their respective costs. This month’s generation charge also reflected the impact of the interim extension of Meralco’s power purchase agreement with First Gas-Sta. Rita plant as approved by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC). The increase was tempered by lower charges from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) that went down by P2.0688 per kWh owing to a decrease of about 1,000 MW in Luzon’s peak demand. IPPs, PSAs, and WESM accounted for 21%, 74%, and 5%, respectively, of Meralco’s total energy requirement for the period. Transmission, taxes, and other charges also registered a total increase of P0.0428 per kWh. Pass-through charges for generation and transmission are paid by Meralco to the power suppliers and the grid operator, respectively, while taxes, universal charges, and Feed-in Tariff Allowance are all remitted to the government. Meralco reiterates that its distribution charge, on the other hand, has not moved since the P0.0360 per kWh reduction for a typical residential customer beginning August 2022. Customers also continue to benefit from the ongoing implementation of the distribution-related true-up adjustment, equivalent to a reduction of P0.2024 per kWh for residential customers. With the recent earthquakes affecting parts of the country, Meralco assured its customers that it continuously safeguards its distribution facilities from potential hazards to ensure the safety of both of its crews and customers. Among the safety measures the power distributor implements include replacing wooden poles with taller and more durable concrete or steel ones, relocating facilities away from high-risk areas such as railroad tracks and waterways, and conducting regular tree trimming and wire clearing operations to manage foreign attachments on power lines. The company also implements re-insulation and conductor shielding of power lines, enhancing of lightning protection systems, and installing of smart devices to swiftly identify and isolate service concerns. Meralco also stands ready to de-energize power if the situation warrants it to protect the public. Likewise, Meralco enjoins customers to continue observing electrical safety measures to be better prepared for disasters and avoid accidents. These include unplugging appliances when not in use, regularly inspecting electrical cords for damage, and knowing the location of the main electrical switch for quick access during emergencies. After an earthquake, and only if it is safe to do so, customers should turn off the main switch or breaker to prevent fire or electrocution, unplug devices to avoid further damage, and steer clear of any damaged equipment or downed power lines. Electrical hazards should also be reported to Meralco. – Rappler.com",True,true,Meralco rates go up in October due to higher generation charge,https://www.rappler.com/business/meralco-power-rates-october-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Inflation eased to 1.5% in November as the rise of vegetable and meat prices slowed, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said on Friday, November 5. The latest inflation print brings the average rate for 2025 to 1.6%, still below the government’s target range of 2% to 4%. Deputy National Statistician Divina Gracia del Prado said inflation of food and non-alcoholic beverages fell to just 0.1% in November. For vegetables in particular, inflation dropped to 4% from 16.4% in October, while for meat, inflation slowed to 4.2% from 5.2%. But “other pelagic fish,” which ranked as the top contributor to the overall November figure, saw higher inflation of 13% from 11.7%, driven by galunggong (round scad) prices that went up due to the recent tropical cyclones that hit the country. “Naapektuhan din siya, so we have a scarcity of galunggong kaya mataas din ‘yung price niya,” Del Prado said. (The supply was affected, so we have a scarcity of round scad and that’s why its prices are currently high.) Del Prado also noted that inflation of beans jumped from -12% in October to 12.4% in November. Prices of onions and shallots have also been trending upward, recording an even higher 48.2% inflation rate from the already elevated 34.9%. In Metro Manila, inflation slightly eased to 2.8% from 2.9% the prior month. Regions outside Metro Manila also saw a similar slowdown to 1.2% from 1.3%. Central Visayas recorded the fastest inflation rate at 3.3% while the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao saw continuous deflation or negative inflation at -1.4%. Deflation means price levels are decreasing. Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan attributed the slowdown to the Marcos administration’s efforts to strengthen the food supply chain and ensure food security. “The sustained moderation in inflation reflects our commitment to protect consumers and strengthen our economic resilience against global and domestic headwinds. We will continue implementing timely, well-coordinated policies to keep prices stable and ensure progress is felt by every Filipino,” the country’s chief economist said. DEPDev added that the Department of Agriculture has issued guidelines to safeguard the country against African swine fever while facilitating safe pork imports. These include the recognition of ASF-free zones within accredited exporting countries. Executive Secretary Ralph Recto also said the latest inflation print will give the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) more room for another rate cut in its final monetary policy meeting of the year on Thursday, December 11. Apart from the BSP’s monetary policy meeting, the Development Budget Coordination Committee is also set to discuss the country’s economic growth and inflation targets on Tuesday, December 9. – Tatiana Maligro, with reports from Arriane dela Cruz/Rappler.com Arriane dela Cruz is a Rappler intern.

"MANILA, Philippines – Corruption is not just about stolen money — it’s about stolen futures. The ongoing investigation into the flood control scandal is a stark reminder that billions of pesos meant for public safety often end up in private pockets. The question is, how do we stop this? Three accountability tools — SALN, lifestyle checks, and citizen vigilance — can finally make the powerful answer for their unexplained wealth. The Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth or SALN is not just a form — it’s the most powerful weapon against corruption. Required under Article XI, Section 17 of the 1987 Constitution and Republic Act 6713, it compels every government official — from barangay captains to the president — to declare their total assets, liabilities, and relatives in government every year. By comparing an official’s declared net worth with their lawful income, the public and authorities can uncover unexplained wealth — a clear red flag for corruption, bribery, or kickbacks from government contracts. Ask this: Penalty reminder: Because public office is a public trust — not a business opportunity — the SALN exists to protect taxpayers, not to protect the corrupt. A lifestyle check is more than a moral test — it’s a financial investigation into where the money really comes from. Conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman, it determines if an official’s lifestyle and assets are grossly disproportionate to their lawful income. In scandals like the flood control kickback scheme, investigators can cross-match SALN, income tax returns, and BIR records with land titles, vehicle registrations, and business interests. When an official earning just six figures suddenly lives like a billionaire, that’s not success — that’s suspicious wealth. How it works: Findings: Disproportionate assets = probable violation of the Anti-Graft Law (Republic Act 3019), Plunder Law (RA 7080), and possible tax evasion under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC). So, how can some officials, with these salaries, own billion-peso properties, luxury fleets, and lavish overseas vacations? Here’s the truth: Even the notorious gangster Al Capone wasn’t convicted for murder — he was caught for tax evasion. That’s the same principle our BIR can use today. By conducting risk-based lifestyle audits with the COA and the Ombudsman, we can trace hidden kickbacks through undeclared income and fake expenses — and finally prosecute corrupt officials for tax evasion, with penalties including imprisonment, asset forfeiture, and perpetual disqualification from public office. Because corruption may hide behind influence and position, but it always leaves a trail in the taxes they didn’t pay. We don’t have to wait for whistleblowers. In the digital age, every Filipino can be a corruption watchdog. A platform like “e-SumbongMo” can empower citizens to submit photos, property records, or social media evidence exposing officials’ lavish lifestyles, fake costs, or undeclared assets — safely, anonymously, and directly to authorities. How it should work: Imagine this: If every Filipino could report a corrupt politician with a photo or document as easily as reporting a crime, how many would still dare to steal? Because accountability begins when citizens see something and say something — and government finally listens. The flood control scandal is not an isolated case — it’s a symptom of a deeper disease that thrives on impunity and silence. Until the government strictly enforces SALN compliance, conducts risk-based lifestyle audits, and builds a real-time citizen reporting system, corruption will remain business as usual. As I always say: “Stop auditing ordinary taxpayers. Audit corrupt politicians and their family businesses. If we can’t recover all the stolen money, at least make sure they never steal again.” – Rappler.com Reference/s:",True,true,"[Ask the Tax Whiz] How SALN, lifestyle checks, and citizen action can expose corruption",https://www.rappler.com/business/ask-the-tax-whiz-how-saln-lifestyle-checks-citizen-action-expose-corruption/,Rappler
"SEOUL, South Korea – South Korean e-commerce company Coupang announced on Monday, December 29, a compensation deal worth 1.69 trillion won ($1.18 billion) to holders of 33.7 million accounts for a massive data leak that triggered a backlash from users and lawmakers. Coupang said customers will get company vouchers of 50,000 won each. The plan comes a day after Coupang founder Kim Bom issued his first public apology for last month’s data breach and pledged to expedite compensation measures. However, Kim has declined to attend parliamentary hearings scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, citing prior commitments. However, criticism has mounted over Coupang’s decision to provide compensation in the form of vouchers that can only be used on its own services and platforms. Choi Min-hee, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party and chair of the National Assembly’s Science, ICT, Broadcasting and Communication committee, said in a Facebook post that Coupang was “bundling coupons for services no one uses,” criticizing the company for offering vouchers tied to its less popular services. She added that Coupang appeared to be trying to turn the crisis into a business opportunity. Consumer advocacy group Korea National Council of Consumer Organizations said Coupang’s plan made a mockery of consumers and downplayed the severity of the data breach, describing it as a marketing tool designed to encourage additional purchases rather than as a sign of restitution. When asked about public criticism of its compensation plan, Coupang said it had no further comment.

"Chinese semiconductor company Wingtech said on Monday, October 13, it will take actions to protect its rights and will seek government support, after Dutch authorities ordered an intervention at its Netherlands-based subsidiary Nexperia. On Sunday, the Dutch government said it is intervening at Nexperia, which manufactures computer chips for the car and consumer electronics industries, due to worries about the possible transfer of crucial technology to its parent Wingtech. The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said its intervention was in reaction to administrative shortcomings at the company and would allow it to reverse or block harmful decisions while the company’s regular production may continue. The Dutch move against US-sanctioned Wingtech came after the Trump administration dramatically expanded prohibitions late last month to include subsidiaries of blacklisted companies. Wingtech said in a stock exchange filing that its control over Nexperia will be temporarily restricted due to the Dutch order and court rulings, affecting decision making and operational efficiency. “The company is actively consulting with international law firms on legal remedies and strategies, and will take all necessary actions to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the company and shareholders,” Wingtech said. “We are proactively engaging with relevant government departments to seek their support.” Wingtech’s Shanghai-listed shares plunged 10% on Monday to a one-month low. A Nexperia spokesperson said on Sunday the company adheres to “all existing laws and regulations, export controls and sanction regimes.” Nexperia is one of the world’s largest makers of simple computer chips such as diodes and transistors. The Dutch Economic Affairs Ministry described the intervention, under a law intended to ensure critical goods remain available during an emergency, as “highly exceptional” and noted it could be subject to a court appeal. – Rappler.com",True,true,China’s Wingtech seeks government help after Dutch intervention at Nexperia unit,https://www.rappler.com/technology/wingtech-seeks-china-government-help-dutch-intervention-nexperia/,Rappler
"With e-commerce platforms continuing to offer cheaper goods than many of those sold in bricks and mortar, big Philippine retailers continue to adapt in a bid to attract more consumers to physical stores. And the way they’re doing it is by making retail experiential. Here are some recent cases in the Philippines: In the age of experiential retail, buying a Teddy Bear isn’t the way it used to be. For the longest time, buying a huggable teddy bear was just picking one from store shelves and paying for it. Now, they’ve made buying that plush toy a more emotional experience. In select malls in Metro Manila, create-your-own plush toys brand Hello Bear has set up operations that let people partly create their own huggable plushies. First, you choose a plush toy animal that’s not filled with stuffing material. Second, you attach the plush toy to a machine and by pressing on a foot pedal, the machine blows the fluff into the plush toy. You can fill it up or leave it half-filled, depending on how soft you want it. Third, you can choose to add a battery-operated small red heart into the plush to give it an artificial heart beat. It stops automatically when the toy is not being used. You can also add a small voice recorder that can record any message you want the plush to repeat. A post shared by Hello Bear (@hellobearph) Fourth, you or the attendant stiches the hole. Fifth, you can opt to buy accessories for the plush toy such as clothes, toy head phone, toy camera, sunglasses, or head band. Sixth, give the plushie a name, which will be written on an ID card. The plush toy will cost a minimum of P1,000. The cost increases with more gadgets and accessories. There are Hello Bear outlets at Century City Mall in Makati; Venice Grand Canal in BGC; Newport World Resorts, Pasay City; Toys R Us Power Plant Mall in Makati; and Toys R Us Opus Mall in Quezon City; Promenade, Greenhills in San Juan City. Similarly, Philippine company Sunnies Inc., which started as a sunglasses retailer, now has other business lines such as selling water bottles. But it’s not your usual choose one from shelves stacked with flasks. Sunnies has transformed the act of buying a flask into a retail experience. Sunnies Flask is now available in Cebu 🌐 Come say hi and build your dream flask 🎨 📍Sunnies World, SM City Cebu 📍SM Seaside City Cebu There are three types of flasks — Robo flask, Bubble flask, Pebble flask, with four sizes to choose from 16oz, 25oz, 30oz, and 32 oz. The cheapest flask is the smallest at P695. There’s a wide array of colors to choose from too. After choosing the basic flask components, buyers can opt to add accessories: the rubber boot or bottom (P195 to P245); the glider (P195); flask cleaner (P195), and the flask sling or bag (895). Buyers can have their name, initials, or any word or symbol they want engraved — with a number of fonts to choose from — on the insulated bottles for free. “We offer something unique. When we launched the flask, it is an industry that’s been there, it is traditional business model. What we did was to have some customization aspect where you can mix and match your flask. This highly personalized experience is what brings them to the stores,” Sunnies Inc. CEO Eric Dee said in a recent interview on the business show Money Talks. Lite Bottle engraving at the Sunnies Run 🖊️ Get free engraving with every purchase in-store. Applies to all Bottles except for the Lite Bottle in nata Sunnies has collaborated with the global hit KPop Demon Hunters and now sells Huntrix-designed flasks. There are 7 ready-made flasks to choose from — Rumi, Mira, Zoey, Jinu, Huntrix, Soda Pop, and Derpy Tiger. Each flask comes with a set of stickers that you can use to design the flask. They also sell KPop Demon Hunters name tags, flask slings, and pods (round mini bags). Sunnies has complemented their physical upgrade with digital promotions of Sunnies products on TikTok, the young generation’s preferred platform. “A lot of the growth comes from new market places such as TikTok. A lot of spending, a lot of revenue is now directed into fast purchases from that social channel,” Dee said. “TikTok is mostly live selling, pushing, explaining price products and much cheaper. We’re doing a lot of both [physical and digital].” A post shared by Bonifacio High Street (@bonifaciohighstreet) Sunnies has also set up two big outlets — one in SM Mall of Asia and the other in Bonifacio Global City — that combine all their brands – Sunnies eyewear, Sunnies Face makeup, Sunnies Flask, and Sunnies Coffee — so that customers can “seek the full Sunnies experience…,” a place where people can “meet, drink, read, and engage.” ​SM Megamalls president Steven Tan, in a recent interview on the ABS-CBN News Channel, cited the case of the Sunnies World outlet in SM Mall of Asia as a prime example of how enterprises stay relevant in the digital age. “Filipinos, especially the younger ones, GenZs and Gen Alphas, they look for experiences nowadays. It’s no longer, you put out your wares, they come, they buy. You really have to entice them, make it really pleasurable and enjoyable for them,” he said. “In Sunnies World in MOA, you can do personalization, emboss your initials, they even have a café inside, they have a make-up consultant for you. All these things you cannot do online. These are things online cannot replace.” And then, there’s cinema 3.0, supposedly better than IMAX. SM Prime, the biggest cinema operator in the country, hasn’t given up on the cinema business, even though more people continue to shift to streaming platforms for movie-going. Last September, it opened the country’s first SCREENX theater in the Philippines’ largest mall, SM Mall of Asia (MOA). “SCREENX enhances the traditional movie experience by extending the image across the main screen onto the theatre’s right and left walls, creating a fully immersive viewing environment unlike any other,” said SM Cinema in a press release. Below are some videos that show what watching on SCREENX is like. SM partnered with South Korean-based CJ 4DPLEX, a company that has developed film technologies such as 4DX and UltraDX. If you want to experience SCREENX during the long holiday break, you can watch Avatar: Fire and Ash at SM MOA. Tickets cost P700 each. SM Supermalls president Steven Tan said SCREENX could attract the younger generation back to cinemas. “You just have to create a different experience, they want immersive experience. Screen X, the latest technology, [the screen is] is not just in front of you but goes all the way to the sides, like a 360-degree experience…,” Tan said in a recent interview with the Manila Bulletin. “Gone are the days of big cinemas. They’re not after that.” Whether these business innovations will succeed for the long term remain to be seen, especially since they make the retail experience more expensive. But one thing’s for sure: we’re going to see more experiential retail in 2026 and in the years to come. – Rappler.com",True,true,[BizSights] Malling 3.0: How retailers are upgrading your shopping experience,https://www.rappler.com/voices/rappler-blogs/bizsights-how-retailers-upgrading-shopping-experience/,Rappler
"Claim: House Speaker Martin Romualdez was suspended from office. Why we fact-checked this: The YouTube video bearing the claim, posted on June 25, has gained 18,894 views, 455 likes, and 82 comments. The video’s thumbnail shows photos of Romualdez, Vice President Sara Duterte, and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. seemingly holding a document. Text on the thumbnail reads: “Pina-suspend si Martin (Martin was suspended).” The bottom line: Romualdez remains a member of the lower chamber and is House Speaker of the current 19th Congress. While the video’s thumbnail implies that Marcos ordered Romualdez’s suspension, the President cannot suspend a sitting House member. Article VI, Section 16, of the Constitution explains the process: “Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds of all its Members, suspend or expel a Member. A penalty of suspension, when imposed, shall not exceed sixty days.” Romualdez and Duterte ties: The misleading video didn’t provide any information to prove its claim. Instead, the narrator merely commented on Romualdez’s remarks on Duterte’s decision to resign from the Marcos Cabinet. Asked to comment on the Vice President stepping down as education secretary, Romualdez said: “As the Vice President mentioned, I think this was her personal decision, and we respect the decision.” Romualdez served as Duterte’s campaign manager during the 2022 elections and both were then members of the political party Lakas-CMD. However, rumors of an alleged rift swirled during the 2023 budget hearings, when the House of Representatives stripped Duterte of her confidential funds for 2024. The Vice President’s political allies were also demoted from their senior roles in the lower chamber, and some lawmakers began supporting probes into the Dutertes, particularly resolutions urging government cooperation with the International Criminal Court’s investigation into former president Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war. On June 24, Romualdez said he still wished Duterte well. “We only wish the vice president nothing but the best and we wish her always the best of luck in all endeavors and in her service to the Filipino people.” – Andrei Santos/Rappler.com Andrei Santos is a graduate of Rappler’s fact-checking mentorship program.

"MANILA, Philippines – The National Privacy Commission (NPC) on Thursday, October 30, said it concluded its investigation into reports of a possible data leak involving GCash and found “no sufficient basis to conclude that a personal data breach occurred within G-Xchange, Inc. (GCash).” The review began after a dataset allegedly linked to GCash appeared on a deep-web forum. The regulator said it immediately initiated an inquiry upon discovery of the report, and on October 27 ordered the company to submit technical documents, preserve system logs, and join a clarificatory conference and live system demonstration. GCash complied, providing a written explanation and participating in the demonstration. The NPC’s Complaints and Investigation Division found the data sample “was inconsistent with GCash’s verified data structures. Several of the listed accounts were found to be invalid or inactive, and no indicators of unauthorized access, infiltration, or data exfiltration were detected.” A technical demo on October 29 covering logs from January 1 to October 29, 2025, showed “no unauthorized access attempts” to core databases, including those with e-KYC (know-your-customer) information. Logs showed “zero events, confirming that only pre-approved internal IP addresses interacted with the system.” The public was urged to stay vigilant and report suspected privacy violations to the commission. – Rappler.com",True,true,NPC finds no GCash data breach after probe,https://www.rappler.com/technology/npc-probe-gcash-data-breach-october-2025/,Rappler

"MANILA, Philippines – If you’re looking for a New Year’s resolution that will still matter when the year’s excitement fades, retirement is a good place to start, even if it feels a little premature this early in January. More specifically, PERA is one tool worth looking at. PERA, or the Personal Equity and Retirement Account, is designed to help you build a steady retirement investing habit, with tax perks that ordinary investing doesn’t offer. It isn’t a new type of fund in itself, but instead a legal framework created under the PERA Act of 2008 that sets the rules and incentives for how your retirement money is invested. If you’re familiar with the 401(k) system in the US, it’s basically the Philippines’ version of that retirement account. Though it’s been introduced as a concept for almost two decades now, PERA products only really began rolling out years later, as providers built products and went through accreditation. For example, the Bank of the Philippine Island’s (BPI) PERA Money Market Fund lists December 19, 2016 as its launch date, which gives you a sense of how long it took for mainstream offerings to show up. Then came the more modern layer. The government and private sector started pushing “digital PERA” distribution, including platforms that let investors open and manage PERA accounts online. One milestone is the launch of the country’s first digital PERA platform in September 2020, which was framed as a way to widen access and reduce friction for retail savers. Since then, more players have entered the space, including firms that aren’t banks. DragonFi, for instance, is a securities broker that now offers PERA account access through its platform, which reflects how PERA has gradually expanded beyond traditional bank channels. But before anything else, let’s clear out two questions you might have. “Will this make me rich?” No retirement vehicle can honestly promise that. “Will this make my investing more efficient?” That is what PERA is designed to do. PERA cannot guarantee gains, but it can make the gains you do earn more valuable by reducing the tax drag that usually chips away at investment income. PERA is also voluntary. You can open one on your own, and an employer may offer a PERA program, but it is not mandatory in the way SSS contributions are. A PERA account is not an investment by itself. It is a container that holds retirement investments, under a set of rules. Those rules cover who can offer PERA products, what kinds of investments are allowed, what tax benefits apply, and when you can withdraw without losing perks. When you put money into PERA, your money does not sit there doing nothing. It gets invested into qualified PERA investment products. This distinction matters because PERA is often misunderstood as a special fund. In reality, it is closer to a retirement account that can hold different funds and instruments, as long as they fit the eligibility rules. That said, here is the “menu” a PERA account is allowed to invest in according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP): UITF units, mutual fund shares, annuity contracts, insurance pension products, pre-need pension plans, listed shares traded on a local exchange, exchange-traded bonds, and government securities, plus other categories that regulators may allow under specific conditions That’s speaking legally. Practically though, what a typical retail investor can actually buy today under PERA is narrower, and usually centers on PERA-qualified funds such as money market, bond, and equity UITFs. This is also why PERA isn’t a loophole to get any investment you want tax-free. For instance, while some administrators may have certain PERA-eligible stocks for you to invest in, you cannot just pick any stock, any REIT, or any bond you personally like and drop it into a PERA wrapper. So if you are the kind of reader who wants to build a retirement portfolio made of individual stocks and bonds, PERA may still feel restrictive depending on which provider you choose and what they offer right now. That, however, is not a reason to dismiss it outright, especially considering its benefits. The reason PERA stays compelling is its tax treatment. PERA’s advantages boil down to three things: a 5% tax credit on qualified contributions, tax-exempt investment income, and tax-free withdrawals upon qualified retirement, plus a legal protection that treats PERA assets differently for insolvency and estate purposes. The easiest benefit to visualize is the tax credit because it behaves like a rebate on what you put in. The PERA Act provides a tax credit equivalent to 5% of your total qualified PERA contributions made in a year, subject to annual contribution limits of P200,000 per year for locally employed and self-employed individuals, and P400,000 per year for overseas Filipinos. Here is what the tax credit looks like in practice. If you contribute P100,000 this year, the tax credit is P5,000. If you max out P200,000, the tax credit becomes P10,000, and if you are an overseas Filipino contributing P400,000, it becomes P20,000. Those tax credits are valid within five years from issuance and can be used to pay or reduce your income tax. The second benefit is one that compounds over time: the income earned from PERA investments is exempt from taxes on investment income. Suppose you have a bond fund that earns P20,000 in investment income in a year. In a normal taxable setting, part of that income may be subject to taxes depending on the instrumen. The actual money that you get is less the tax withheld, which is usually around 20%. When you keep that investment in PERA, the framework is designed so that qualifying investment income can stay inside the account without those investment-income taxes applying the same way, which means more of the return remains invested and compounding. The third benefit is less talked about, but it matters for peace of mind and long-term planning. The PERA Act states that PERA assets are not considered assets of the contributor for purposes of insolvency and estate taxes, and it also emphasizes non-assignability, meaning these assets generally can’t be attached, garnished, or seized. In simple terms, PERA is structured to be harder to reach in financial distress, and cleaner to pass on in certain scenarios, which can help it play a role in estate planning. The BSP’s PERA FAQ reinforces this framing and notes that distributions upon death are covered under the rules. Remember, PERA is built for retirement. That means it has a definition of what retirement looks like in its rules. To get the tax-free distributions, you have to meet the “55 and 5” rule: you’ve reached age 55 and have completed at least five yearly contributions. If you withdraw earlier, you forfeit the tax incentives you’ve enjoyed, with all taxes repaid to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). This includes the 20% tax on total income earned and the 5% tax credit that you’ve received. There are, however, important exceptions. Withdrawal penalties don’t apply in cases such as accident or illness-related hospitalization in excess of 30 days, permanent total disability, and certain transfers to another PERA investment product and or another administrator within a specified window. Though this might seem like a tricky restriction, it can also help in building your retirement fund. A normal investment account is liquid. Ordinary investment accounts are liquid, and liquidity is convenient but tempting. PERA adds healthy friction, which makes it easier to leave your retirement money alone, and it works best when you treat contributions as a long-term habit. – Rappler.com Finterest is Rappler’s series that demystifies the world of money and gives practical advice on managing your personal finances.",True,true,"[Finterest] What is PERA, the Philippines’ 401(k)-style retirement account?",https://www.rappler.com/business/finterest-things-to-know-pera-philippines-retirement-account/,Rappler

"The Philippines’ alleged P1.7-trillion market meltdown which dominated the conversation in traditional and social media should have already shook down business, and could have spiraled into unimaginable crash. It didn’t because it wasn’t true. But in the minds of many, including equities players I held in esteem, the news somehow gained significant credibility. Surprisingly, no one cared to verify the claim, allowing the narrative to flourish with people sharing and discussing it at length as if it were gospel truth. It actually started as whispers in coffee shops. My friends deep inside the military establishment early on warned me that it could be part of a destabilization plot intended to take advantage of public anger about the infamous flood control scandal. I, for one, took the assertion for granted because the amount involved was too humongous to be believable. Moreover, the narrative was that the market loss happened in just three weeks! Unfortunately, the claim received more plausibility when Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Francis Lim virtually confirmed its veracity in a public forum: “The flood control project scandal has shaken public confidence, wiping out an extraordinary P1.7 trillion in market value of our publicly listed companies in just three weeks, despite rising corporate earnings. Investors aren’t fleeing because of weak fundamentals; they’re fleeing because of weak integrity. It’s a stark reminder that corruption is a weapon of mass wealth destruction.” Malacañang pushed back, branding the claim as fake news. In a media statement, Lim clarified that his speech before the Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines (FINEX) on October 7, “in which I cited a report claiming that recent corruption issues had wiped out about ₱1.7 trillion in market value of publicly listed companies” was sourced from “information, which had been circulating within business circles and cited by some media outlets, [which I believed at the time was] a credible industry report.” He added that he has since discovered the report to be fictitious. “I deeply regret any confusion or concern that my statement may have caused. My sole intent was to underscore the vital importance of integrity in our markets and the devastating impact corruption can have on investor confidence.” In a Viber message to Vantage Point, Lim said: “I really don’t know where [the claim] originated. As stated in my statement, it had been going around in some business orgs and was also mentioned in some news sources. But whatever it is, I take responsibility.” To get to the bottom of the issue, I did some forensic number-crunching. And this is what I found out: At least for one week in mid-September, the market cap rose ~1.91 % week over week. I gathered some weekly market cap figures: Using these data as rough proxies: So, roughly, over those approximate month spans: –2.6 % drop from July to August, then +2.5 % gain from late August into mid-September. (These are estimates based on weekly snapshots, not precise month‐end data.) I pulled the Philippine Stock Exchange’s (PSE) own Weekly Reports for July-September 2025 and computed the week-on-week (WoW) and month-on-month (MoM) moves in Total Market Capitalization. The forensic data from the PSE Weekly Reports itself effectively debunks the narrative that the market “lost ₱1.7 trillion in three weeks.” Let’s summarize the evidence clearly. From the PSE’s own published weekly total market capitalization, the changes are: From the table, we can see that: The ₱1.7 trillion “wiped-out value” claim cannot be substantiated by any verifiable PSE data. The real decline was ₱180 billion to ₱500 billion, depending on the window examined — roughly 1% to 3 % of total capitalization. So there. The forensic evidence from the exchange itself disproves the ₱1.7 trillion loss narrative. I’m starting to be convinced that this could be what my friends in the military were describing as an attempt at economic destabilization. There’s a ghost haunting the Philippines — not of the dead, but of deceit. It drifts through newsfeeds, lurks in headlines, and seeps into coffee-shop talk. The ₱1.7-trillion plunge in three weeks was a phantom loss — spectacular, terrifying, and utterly unreal. No such collapse happened. The numbers were twisted shadows of truth, distorted by echo chambers hungry for drama. Yet the ghost of that story walked through trading floors, spooking investors and citizens alike. It fed on our greatest weakness: our disbelief in those who govern us. Because when the living institutions no longer inspire trust, the ghosts of falsehood rise to fill the void. That is the real tragedy. The same spirit of suspicion haunts the ongoing flood control scandal — an investigation that promised cleansing, but which is turning out to be a séance of self-interest. Every revelation feels pre-scripted, every “witness” seems conjured, and every pronouncement reeks of political necromancy. Instead of exorcising corruption, our leaders are raising old ghosts for partisan gain. We used to believe in evidence, in process, in due diligence. Now we believe in what sounds dramatic. The ₱1.7-trillion ghost story spread faster than any official correction because truth has become the weaker spirit. The bureaucracy speaks in technicalities, the politicians speak in riddles, and the people — tired of decoding lies — cling to whatever version of reality feeds their outrage. This is the new governance curse: when credibility dies, myths inherit the throne. The flood control probe should have been a beacon of reform; instead, it is a fog machine. Each hearing spawns new specters of accusation, while genuine accountability remains invisible. And like the stock-market scare, this pattern reveals a deeper malaise — not just corruption, but the erosion of public faith. Governance without trust is a haunted house. Every press release, every Senate statement, every “exclusive” leak creaks with suspicion. Even facts, when uttered by officials, sound like apparitions rehearsed to deceive. We must learn to exorcise these ghosts — not by burning effigies or silencing critics, but by reviving transparency and integrity in governance. Truth must once again stand solid, not give rise to the spectral. Until then, we remain a nation haunted — by phantoms of corruption, by specters of falsehood, and by the chilling realization that the most dangerous ghosts are the ones we keep believing in. There is still time to break the spell, but it requires courage from both leaders and people. The government must dare to confront its own ghosts — the culture of impunity, the comfort of secrecy, the tolerance for mediocrity. The people must dare to confront their ghosts — the addiction to outrage, the laziness of blind belief, the refusal to verify before sharing. Truth is not dead. It is merely buried beneath layers of clamor, neglect, and apathy. To resurrect the truth, we must become a nation of exorcists — each of us must be committed to dispelling lies, not spreading them. Until then, we remain a haunted republic: our markets shaken by illusions, our politics ruled by phantoms, and our collective soul chained to skepticism. The ghost that shook the market is not just an economic apparition — it is the spirit of our own surrender. And unless we learn to face it, it will keep returning, whispering the same warning: A nation that no longer believes in truth is already halfway to its grave. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] The ghostly P1.7-trillion market plunge,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-ghostly-trillion-peso-market-plunge/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – How does P185 billion just disappear? That’s roughly how much market value vanished from the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) in just a few weeks. And while it’s not quite the P1.7 trillion that Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Francis Lim first claimed — a figure so wildly off the mark it turned out to be “fictitious” — the real number is still worrying. (READ: [Finterest] PSE may not have lost P1.7-T, but its weakness is still a problem) Taken at face value, it sounds catastrophic, but what really happens when we report such a loss? What exactly happened to those billions? Was it just destroyed, like torching piles upon piles of cash? If not, where does it go, and who’s paying the price? When analysts or reporters say the market “lost P185 billion,” they’re referring to a drop in total market capitalization, which refers to the overall value of all listed companies on the PSE. Public companies are priced share by share. Multiply a company’s share price by the number of shares outstanding and you get that company’s market capitalization. Add up the market caps of all listed companies and you get the market’s total value. The difference between two periods (say, last week’s total and today’s) is what we call the market’s “loss” or “gain.” Sometimes, instead of measuring the change in market cap for every single company in the PSE, only the change for the companies in the PSE index (PSEi) is used. In simple terms, a loss in market value means the total market cap of companies in the PSE went down because their share prices dropped. You can think of market cap as the crowd’s latest opinion, not a hard appraisal of a company’s factories, cash flows, or land. That’s why when we say that it dropped by P185 billion, it doesn’t mean that the cash literally vanished. What it really means is that, on paper, the collective value of companies has declined because investors are now willing to pay less for their shares. This doesn’t automatically mean that all investors lost that money outright. If you’re holding stocks that fell in value and you don’t sell, that “loss” is unrealized. It exists only on paper, reflecting weak market sentiment at a specific moment. If prices rise again, the value returns. But if you sell when prices are low, then the loss becomes realized, and that’s when the money is truly gone from your pocket. Prices move when buyers and sellers agree to trade at a new level. That agreement reflects lots of inputs: company earnings, interest rates, currency moves, liquidity, and risk appetite. It also reflects stories that change how investors feel about the future. Corruption headlines matter because they raise the perceived risk that rules will not be followed, projects will not get built, and bribes will erode profits. When share prices fall, it usually means there’s more selling than buying at those levels. But that doesn’t mean everyone selling is losing money. Some investors may have bought their shares much earlier, at lower prices, and are now cashing in profits. Others, especially those who entered recently, may be cutting losses or shifting funds somewhere safer. So, if your portfolio is flashing red, it doesn’t always mean every investor is bearing a loss. In fact, that dip you’re seeing might even be the result of a big institutional investor taking profit on a position they made years ago, back when the stock was much cheaper. Who exactly is driving this selling? In recent months, foreigners have consistently been net sellers, which isn’t something that’s isolated to the Philippines. In fact, that’s reflective of a regional trend of fund outflows from emerging markets. But in the Philippines, it’s particularly a big deal because foreigners still make up nearly half of all trading activity in the PSE year-to-date. Heavy foreign selling tends to weigh on blue chips, especially those with large foreign ownership. Retail activity tends to show up more in mid- to small-cap names or speculative counters. That’s why when foreign investors pull out, it can cause the index to jitter. But outflows aren’t always a “vote against” the Philippines. Across Asia, foreign institutional investors have been trimming exposure to emerging markets, driven by global risk sentiment, such as higher US interest rates, tensions in the Middle East, and portfolio shifts toward less risky assets like the US Treasuries. Meanwhile, some funds are simply rebalancing ahead of the year-end, locking in profits or reducing risk. We can never be 100% sure what is causing markets to move. We can say corruption likely contributed, but we should also be honest about what the data can and cannot prove. It’s not like the PSE publishes a footnote at the end of each day saying the market “fell 1.2% due to scandal.” Market movements are influenced by countless factors, such as economic data, global sentiment, policy signals, quarterly earnings, political rhetoric, and even social media posts. What we can do is look at evidence and make an informed interpretation, rather than assert a cause-and-effect relationship. For example, you may see several negative governance headlines in succession, a pickup in net foreign selling, and larger drops in stocks exposed to public works. That supports the narrative that governance fears weighed on prices. Another example is when REIT prices fall immediately after a surprise interest rate hike by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). Higher rates make bonds and other fixed-income assets more appealing than dividend-paying REITs, which may prompt REIT investors to sell. If price drops sharply right after such an announcement, it’s reasonable to link the event to the market’s reaction. But attribution is probabilistic. In the case of the recent sell-off, remember that besides the flood control scandal, there’s also the global backdrop of tensions in the Middle East, the US government shutdown, uncertainty over tariffs, and shifting central bank policies from the BSP and Fed — all of which may be top of mind for foreign institutional investors. It’s for this reason why analysts would say “The market retreated as investors reacted to…” or “The sell-off coincided with…” — to emphasize that we’re really only looking at correlations. For retail investors, the biggest impact of a market slump is psychological. It’s unnerving to see your portfolio balance drop, especially when headlines reinforce the fear about billions disappearing. But as long as you don’t sell, your losses remain paper losses, and they can reverse as easily as they appeared. Historically, investors who stay disciplined and ride out volatility often end up better off, especially when the fundamentals of their investments remain sound. It’s a different story if the company you’re investing in is directly tied to the corruption scandal. Otherwise, fluctuations like these are completely normal in investing and may even make the stock of a strong company undervalued and ripe for buying. That said, your response depends on your goals. If you’re investing short-term, you might need to rebalance to avoid being forced to sell at an even lower price if this downturn lingers. But if you’re in for the long haul and own solid companies or diversified funds, you can ride out this volatility. Investors who stay disciplined and resist panic selling may still recover as markets rebound. While the flood control mess may have shaken some investor confidence, it doesn’t change the fundamentals of most Filipino companies overnight. – Rappler.com Finterest is Rappler’s series that demystifies the world of money and gives practical advice on managing your personal finances.",True,true,[Finterest] What does it really mean when the PSE loses value?,https://www.rappler.com/business/finterest-explainer-philippine-stock-exchange-loses-value/,Rappler
"The Philippines has earned the unenviable — and embarrassing — title of “the country with the fastest rising rates of HIV in Asia and the Pacific.” While the region overall has experienced a 13% drop in the number of cases since 2010, the Philippines has reported a 550% increase between 2010 and 2024, prompting the DOH to push for declaring HIV a public health emergency. This is not an overnight development — the epidemic has been simmering for decades, having transitioned from “low and slow” in the early 2000s to “fast and furious” in the past two decades, with no signs of slowing down. The latest DOH HIV quarterly report, covering April-June 2025, confirms once again the upward trajectory of HIV in the country: 5,000 new cases were recorded — an average of 56 new cases per day are being diagnosed, or one every 25 minutes. In 2010, approximately six new cases per day were reported. Even if we have fewer cases in total compared to countries like Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, these countries have managed to rein in their new cases, with rates dropping overall. Back in 2018, HIV surveillance findings in so-called “key populations,” showed that between 4% to 6% of all young men having sex with men (MSM), and transgender — with a sample of over 4,000 respondents — tested positive for HIV. That’s about one in 20. People who injected drugs, measured in “hot spots” in Cebu, had very high HIV prevalence — 29%, (roughly over one person in four) in 2015. But why declare it a public health emergency only now? I believe this is due to a drying up of funding for HIV (and for general development assistance) from the US Government. The decapitation of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration, to the “sun setting” (rather facetious term for closure) of the Joint United Nations Program on AIDS (UNAIDS) has led to major shortfalls in an already underfunded global HIV response. This ultimately affects other programs such as PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, to the GFATM (Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria). All these agencies have been strong supporters of the HIV responses in the Philippines for decades now. The Philippine government has gradually taken on a larger share of funding for HIV, particularly with regards to medications, and domestic resources are now the major source of funding. However, most of the critical strategies and innovative responses, particularly those related to advocacy and working with CSOs, “key” populations such as drug users, sex workers, MSM and transgender people, are funded through international donors. Understandably, government staff and clinics are less able to reach these — and during the drug war, many simply became unreachable. There are specific ways of HIV transmission: unprotected sexual intercourse with someone who is able to transmit; sharing of unclean needles and injecting equipment, through transfusion of infected blood products, from a pregnant HIV positive mother to her unborn child, or during breastfeeding. Virtually all transmission through the blood, needles, pregnancy and breastfeeding routes have been practically eliminated — by effective screening of blood, during pregnancy, through prophylaxis, and ensuring that needles and injecting equipment are sterile, single-use, and sharing eliminated. Both HIV and Hepatitis B are transmitted in identical ways, but a vaccine for Hep B is available, and none so far for HIV. In the Philippines, 90% to 95% of all reported cases of HIV are due to sexual transmission; in some areas in Cebu, sharing of unclean needles by people who inject drugs is a significant route. Around 85% to 90% of all the new cases are among young men and trans women who report sexual contact with other men or trans. One possible reason for rapid spread is the variant of HIV that is causing infection. Studies by Salvaña et al show that a particular HIV strain, (CRFo1AE) was seen in over 70% of all newly diagnosed cases of HIV between 2016-2018. This subtype was associated with higher viral loads, lower CD 4 counts on diagnosis, and faster progression to AIDS. It may also be a more “aggressive” subtype. Currently there are an estimated 250,000 people with HIV in the Philippines, of which only approximately 57% know their HIV status. In Iloilo province, the percentage of those who know their HIV positive status is even lower — 45%, according to the Provincial Health Office. Of the 57%, just two thirds (66%) are on life-saving Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART). Of those on ART, 47% have viral suppression — or levels of the virus that are so low that HIV transmission is no longer a possibility. Late reporting and limited availability of testing for viral load may explain this low reported rate, as the drugs are very effective and generally viral suppression rates are over 95%. The country is thus very unlikely to reach the “95-95-95” targets for HIV, which will lead to elimination of HIV as a public health threat by 2030. The first 95 refers to the % of people with HIV who know their status; the second 95 refers to the % of people with HIV who are on ART; and the last 95 refers to the % of people on ART with viral suppression. Philippine figures, as of 2025, are merely 57-66-47. The pace of putting people on life-saving treatment cannot keep up with the pace of new infections being diagnosed each month. Meanwhile, of those newly diagnosed, 25% are in an advanced stage of HIV disease — meaning, they have acquired HIV years ago, the immune system has deteriorated, with opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis and pneumocystis. CD 4 counts are very low and viral loads high. Late diagnosis and treatment means more complications, longer times for recovery, more misery, and higher death rates. In the country, 22% or 1 in 5 people on ART has been “lost to follow up,” a rate that should also be cause for alarm. Many who start treatment do not continue, or they drop out. Inadequate treatment leads to drug resistance and treatment failures. Young peoples’ levels of knowledge about HIV have been declining over the years, as reported from the 2021 Young Adult Fertility Surveys (YAFS). AIDS awareness declined from 95% in 1994 and 2002, to 83% in 2013, and 76% in 2021. In 2021, 70% of respondents think they have no chance of getting HIV, a mere 15% know a place for HIV testing, and only 19% of the youth have comprehensive knowledge of HIV prevention and transmission. We must remember that every year, a new cohort of young people become sexually active, and lack the right information about HIV, and how to prevent it. All the prevention messages bear repeating year after year. Not engaging in penetrative sex (i.e., vaginal or anal) reduces risk. Oral sex, sex with condoms and many forms of masturbation are considered low-risk, compared to unprotected (i.e., condom-less, or “bareback”) sex. However, one does not indulge in a single sexual practice during an encounter. It can start with kissing, foreplay, other forms of stimulation leading to oral, vaginal and/or anal intercourse, and may culminate in an orgasm. But even if people do know about safer sex, it is always not easy to say “no,” particularly if one is in the throes of emotions, or conflicted, or excited to try out new things and experiences. There may also be a sense of denial, coupled with rationalizations — “I won’t get infected,” “he is so healthy looking, he could not possibly have HIV,” ”I won’t let him ejaculate in me,” “condoms reduce pleasure,” “it’s only one person that I’ve had sex with,” or ”I did it only once naman,” etc. Complicating the mix are sex parties, having numerous sexual partners, the concurrent use of alcohol, stimulants, and “chemsex” — when under the influences of such substances, one may completely forget protection, or may be too incapacitated to resist or say “no.” As one young yuppie put it, “it is difficult to control carnal desires” and so in the heat of sexual attraction, defenses crumble. The fact is that Pinoys, of all genders, sexual orientations, religions and regions, are having sex, and bearing children. In the 2021 YAFS, 28% of male youth and 16% of females reported having sex before marriage. One in five young women between 15-24 has already had a child, or is currently pregnant. A third of these pregnancies are unwanted — despite all the admonitions about early pregnancy, or not having premarital sex. For someone sexually active now, the traditional “ABCD” messages — Abstain-Be Faithful-Condoms-Don’t inject drugs/share needles — from the ’80s and ’90s are supplemented by other methods. PrEP (Pre-exposure prophylaxis), and self-testing for HIV (tests for HIV are available at drug stores, much like the pregnancy test kits). Condoms, used consistently, properly, and with the right type of lubricants, protect against other sexually transmitted infections (STI) and pregnancy. There are ways of negotiating safer sex practices that reduce the risks of HIV. The slogan “U=U” (Undetectable=Untransmittable) means that a person with adequate treatment whose viral load is undetectable, is, for all practical purposes, no longer able to infect other people. This has enabled discordant partners (one HIV positive and the other HIV negative) to have a fulfilling sexual relationship, and have children, without the fear of possible transmission. Accessibility of the prevention and treatment tools for ALL youth — including those in and out of school, those in prison or in rehab, with sensory and learning difficulties — need to be available. There are young people who are deaf, or have disabilities, and they are also having sexual lives; some may even be subjects of abuse and sexual exploitation. There is virtually no information on HIV for those with hearing disabilities, or with little comprehension of English or Tagalog. There are but a few groups that provide sexual health education for those who cannot hear, see, or who have physical and learning disabilities. Information is not available in different local languages, including braille and sign language, and there are very few trained interpreters. There are physical barriers to access, especially for people who may have mobility issues. Companions are needed when services are being accessed; transportation costs are higher for those with disabilities. Health workers express surprise and even disapproval at youth who are sexually active and not married, and may not be prepared to discuss sex and reproduction with those who have disabilities. The number of facilities offering ART treatment in Panay has increased. Apart from the West Visayas Medical Center (WVMC), there are now 20 HIV treatment hubs and outpatient HIV facilities in Panay, compared to six in 2021. San Jose de Buenavista and Culasi in Antique; Aklan has Boracay, Kalibo, New Washington while Capiz province has Roxas City and Dao. Iloilo has the most: Alimodian, Cabatuan, Calinog, Guimbal, Concepcion, Barotac Nuevo, Balasan, Janiuay, and Pototan. In Iloilo City, treatment hubs are in St. Paul’s Hospital, The Medical City, WVSU Medical Center and the FPOP (Family Planning Organization of the Philippines). People have a choice where they can seek treatment. Many do not wish to receive treatment in their own hometowns for fear of discovery. Some may be having treatment with private practitioners and in other countries. A listing of 300 treatment hubs and primary HIV care facilities nationwide is available from the DOH and the PIA website. ART continues to be free of charge. Stigma and discrimination are major barriers to access. Stigma comes from the perception of HIV as a terminal illness (which it no longer is), contagious (which it is not) and association with people who are considered immoral, deviant, someone who is looked down on and ridiculed — a relic from the years when the then unknown, wasting illness was linked to the 4 Hs — homosexuals, hemophiliacs, heroin users, and haitians. Stigma may be external or/and internalized. Discrimination that reduces a person’s access to information and services is the most damaging; they may be reluctant to go to clinics or join community activities. If there is much stigma about being queer or gay, or being HIV positive, and use of drugs considered illegal, people are unlikely to come forward, get tested for HIV, and will hide or deny their status. They may not want to be seen in a facility that is frequented by people with HIV. Mandatory HIV testing is prohibited by law, but is still practiced. NGOs, CSOs and various community groups are uniquely positioned to support counseling, testing and treatment for young persons who may be at risk for HIV. They have peer educators, innovative outreach services, drop-in centers, and various activities to engage the youth, which clinics are unable to provide. Some of the more prominent NGO-run clinics in the city include FPOP, which offers family planning, laboratory services and primary health care, ARV treatment and a transgender health service. Team Dugong Bughaw (TDB) has the “Yuhum” (Smile) Community Center. Both TDB and FPOP provide HIV screening and counseling, and PrEP. They have volunteers and facilitators whom young people can relate to, and run open, welcoming spaces where young people can feel more safe, confident and comfortable, enabling them to discuss concerns around sexual health and rights, including mental health issues. Contrast this with a room in a crowded hospital corridor, where most HIV treatment facilities can be found. Finally, while the country has an enabling policy on HIV education in schools (through RA 11166, the HIV and AIDS Policy Act) and for Sexual and Reproductive Health education in (mandated by the 2012 RH law), both remain unevenly resourced and implemented. In a study done in an unnamed Philippine city, Kim et al found that “local stakeholders have different concepts of Reproductive Health (RH) and delivered their own perceived concept of RH; teachers lack RH pedagogy and training while they also tend to minimize and modify their teaching in fear of further stimulating student interest in sex.” The RH law, though over a decade old, continues to be controversial and is perceived to be in conflict with Filipino social and cultural norms. In a Department of Education order in September 2025, “Policy on the Implementation of Reproductive Health Education for Adolescent learners in Basic Education,” Secretary Sonny Angara directed the department to “integrate basic and age-appropriate instruction on the causes, modes of transmission and ways of preventing the spread of HIV and AIDS and other STIs into the curricula of public and private learning institutions, including alternative and indigenous learning systems, in accordance with the HIV and AIDS Policy Act.” More specific implementing guidelines need to be developed, though. So there are really quite complex reasons for our rising HIV rates — more testing means more cases, and better early detection and treatment, in the long run. Being ready to discuss sexuality, safer sexual behaviors, HIV prevention and transmission openly and in a non-judgmental way, reducing stigma, doing outreach, increasing condom use and PrEP, and strengthening reproductive health education for youth — in and out of school, could help in blunting the rise of HIV in the country. We need more open discussions with young people, especially young LGBTQ, to find out what they’re thinking, and what might be acceptable and effective interventions to reduce risk. We also need to work closely with non-government organizations, youth organizations, organizations working on sexual and reproductive health and rights. We need innovative ways of reaching young people who may be at extra risk for early sexual activity. How do we make sure they see the prevention messages, recall and practice them, seek out services, and know their HIV status? How do we ensure they are comfortable going to clinics, meeting with health workers, peer educators/counselors, doing telehealth? How do we support people with HIV so that they continue to receive treatment, and not drop off the radar? This is one public health emergency that will be here for decades to come. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Ilonggo Notes] Why do young Filipinos continue to test positive for HIV?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/why-young-filipinos-test-positive-hiv/,Rappler
"Claim: The Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) is accepting job applications through a link provided in a Facebook post. Why we fact-checked this: The Facebook post containing the claim has 10 shares, 34 comments, and 51 reactions as of writing. It was posted on June 7 in a public Facebook group named “PRC BOARD EXAMINATIONS AND UPDATES” with 306,500 members. Bearing the official BFP logo, the post claims that the bureau is hiring K to 12 graduates. The supposed job ad specifies a height requirement and states that there is no age limit for applicants. The post also instructs interested applicants to fill out and submit a form through a link provided in the caption. The facts: The supposed application link is fake and attempts to mislead applicants by using the BFP logo. The link redirects to a blog site with a fake job application form requesting applicants’ personal details such as full name, email address, and phone number. Providing sensitive personal information through these fake links may be exploited by scammers pretending to be credible entities, placing applicants at risk of falling victim to phishing attacks. (READ: Phishing 101: How to spot and avoid phishing) Unauthorized: On June 5, the BFP posted a warning flagging fake job posts using similar language. “The BFP does not support the sharing of unofficial information concerning its activities or programs, such as recruitment or promotion,” the post read. The bureau urged the public to refer to its official social media pages for any recruitment inquiries. Job vacancies: Legitimate application or recruitment information can be found on the official BFP website. As of writing, the latest notice of vacancy was posted on June 4 and advertises for fire senior inspector (legal officer) positions. Job requirements: While the fake job ad did not mention the specific role, previous job notices specify that the BFP requires applicants for most positions to have a bachelor’s degree. According to the Civil Service Commission (CSC), a baccalaureate degree is also required for applicants to qualify for the Fire Officer Examination. The 2024 Fire Officer Examination date has already passed, with results set to be released later in July. The fake job post also claims that applicants must be at least 5’0 and that there is no age limit. According to the CSC, applicants for the fire officer position must be between the ages of 21 to 35.

"Water concessionaire Maynilad made a splash in its Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) debut on Friday, November 7, raising P34.3 billion to fund its massive capital expenditure (capex) program. This makes Maynilad’s debut the PSE’s largest since Monde Nissin’s P48.6-billion public offering in 2021. With such a debut, Maynilad president and chief executive officer Ramoncito Fernandez said the proceeds will fund expansion and service improvements. One thing’s for sure, though: Buying the Villars’ controversial water utility company, PrimeWater, is not in the expansion picture for now. Reports from early October said Maynilad was looking to acquire PrimeWater from the Villars. But Fernandez, in a Friday press conference, denied Maynilad is in talks to acquire the Villar water concessionaire. But he did not completely shut the door on acquiring PrimeWater. The Maynilad chief, however, said that an acquisition could happen if it’s “value-adding” for the water concessionaire. He added that PrimeWater may be in talks with its affiliates. “We are not the ones being talked to, but we don’t know. Our other affiliates can be talked to,” he said. In a press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday, November 13, Fernandez said it was Maynilad’s parent firm, Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (MPIC), that was holding talks with PrimeWater. MPIC owns 53% of Maynilad. “We are not in talks with us, we are not in talks with them, they are in talks with our shareholders,” Fernandez said in a news video aired on the One News business show, Money Talks. One News is part of the MVP Group of Companies. Maynilad board chairman Manny V. Pangilinan (MVP), who is also chair/president/CEO of MPIC, said in the press conference, “I think if it works for us, if it’s commercially feasible for the group, then obviously, we will take a look at it more seriously.” In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Friday, November 14, Maynilad said: “We confirm that exploratory discussions regarding PrimeWater are being undertaken at the Metro Pacific Investments Corporation level. As reported, MPIC has entered into a non-disclosure agreement and has begun preliminary due diligence. Maynilad, however, is not a party to these discussions.” One sister firm that everyone has their eyes on is MetroPac Water Investments Corporation (MWIC), which provides bulk water supply and distribution services to Dumaguete, Iloilo, Cagayan de Oro, and industrial water projects in Vietnam. Former senator Cynthia Villar previously said her husband Manny wants to dispose of PrimeWater since it was being used against them in politics, and it wasn’t making them much money anyway. Instead of acquiring more firms, Fernandez said they want to use the IPO proceeds to fund Maynilad’s “massive” P163-billion capex program to improve its services. Fernandez also said Maynilad is in talks to provide water and wastewater services to the two ongoing reclamation projects in Manila Bay. (READ: Exempted from suspension, Pasay reclamation projects get green light from PRA) “As these reclamation projects will require maybe a decade to build a new city, water will be needed already when they start constructing, so that’s one low-hanging fruit,” Fernandez said in an interview with the ABS-CBN News Channel. Another “low-hanging fruit” for the company includes offering wastewater and sanitation services to its existing commercial and industrial customers. Maynilad also hopes to offer its services to localities adjacent to its current service areas, particularly in Bulacan and Cavite. “The adjacent cities beside our borders, our boundaries, are wanting our services. So that’s a possibility for us that we can offer to these LGUs that are wanting improved services,” he explained. Maynilad is the Philippines’ largest water concessionaire, with 1.5 million billed connections covering 11 Metro Manila cities in the West Zone as well as six areas in Cavite. – Rappler.com",True,true,What’s next for Maynilad after its stock market debut?,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/what-happens-next-maynilad-stock-market-debut/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte will remain detained at the International Criminal Court (ICC) prison in The Hague after the appeals chamber denied his appeal for an interim release. “The appeals chamber unanimously confirms the impugned decision,” said the appeals chamber on Friday, November 28. A separate set of five judges denied the appeal, putting yet another roadblock to Duterte’s attempts at freedom. Dozens of drug war victims and their relatives watched the hearing at a Church center in Manila, and clapped every time they heard the judge say the word “denied” and “rejected.” An interim release is temporary freedom given to ICC detainees if they prove that they do not possess risk factors such as evading the case, recommitting the same crimes the detainee is accused of, and jeopardizing the investigation. There are also conditions to an interim release, such as restraining from communication with the outside world in a country far from the crime scene. The pre-trial chamber denied the request early October, which Duterte elevated to the appeals chamber. “The risks could not be mitigated by the proposed conditions,” said the appeals chamber, adding that while humanitarian grounds were considered, they “were not sufficiently set out in the case at hand.” Judge Luz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza, a Peruvian jurist who heads the five-person chamber, read out the decision. Carranza had previously also ruled against Duterte in June 2023 when the appeals chamber allowed the continuation of the investigation. This appeals chamber upheld entirely the pre-trial chamber, saying that Duterte’s defense team failed to point out the errors of the earlier decision. Duterte’s lawyer, Nicholas Kaufman, wore a stoic face as Judge Carranza repeated the phrase, “the defense failed.” It was also the phrase that cued the staff of Paghilom, the drug war victims refuge center run by Magsaysay Awardee Father Flavie Villanueva. Whenever they heard the phrase, which was the most comprehensible in dense legal sentences of the decision, they clapped. Raisa, not her real name, followed suit and clapped her hands. Her 20-year-old son was killed by policemen in 2020, which means that the date does not fall within the cutoff of the ICC case. Duterte’s case covers killings only up to March 2019, which is when his withdrawal from the Court became effective. But for Raisa, to see Duterte lose his motions gives her a sense of justice. “Kahit po papaano mayroon na kaming unang hakbang na makakamit na namin. Dahil tatlong file nila, ni-reject ng korte. Ang ano namin ay masaya kami dahil alam naman naming papanigan kami dahil nasa tama kami,” she said. (At least we have this first step. The Court rejected three of those he filed. We are happy because we know the court would be on our side, because we are on the right side.) Palace Press Officer Undersecretary Claire Castro said, “The International Criminal Court has already made its decision, and the Palace respects it.” Duterte did not appear at his hearing, waiving his right to be there. “If he can waive his right to appear, can this suffice to indicate cognitive fitness? Enough for him to understand the proceedings before the court?” said Nicolene Arcaina, executive director of the Ateneo Human Rights Center, which has been assisting victims of the war on drugs. The appeals chamber’s decision is final since there is no higher court in the ICC after it. Duterte is facing three counts of crimes against humanity of murder, one count each per context, representing 49 incidents of killings, with 78 victims of the war on drugs and the mysterious Davao Death Squad. Former senator Antonio Trillanes IV, who had pushed for Duterte’s arrest said: “Ngayon na natuldukan na ‘yang interim release na ‘yan, sana ay ‘wag nang magpaasa ang leaders ng Duterte camp sa mga supporters nila. Di na makakalaya si Duterte bilang kabayaran sa libu-libong Pilipinong pinapatay niya.” (Now that the interim release is final, I hope the leaders of the Duterte camp stop giving their supporters false hopes. Duterte won’t be set free as payment for the thousands of Filipinos he had ordered killed.) Right now, Duterte is also appealing a major loss in the pre-trial chamber. In late October, the pre-trial chamber upheld the ICC’s jurisdiction over his case. Had he won it, Duterte would have been cleared of all charges of crimes against humanity due to lack of jurisdiction because the Philippines withdrew as a member of the ICC even before the prosecutor could start an investigation. What is urgent for the victims and the prosecution, however, is for the pre-trial chamber to decide whether Duterte is fit for trial. In a statement, International Association of Democratic Lawyers president Edre U. Olalia said, “Mr. Duterte, you are not going anywhere. You are staying where you rightfully are.” Duterte, who turned 80 years old in the Scheveningen prison, claimed through his lawyer that he has lost critical cognitive skills, and is therefore unfit for trial. The ICC has been contracting neuropsychiatry experts to determine the veracity of his claim. With that claim still up in the air, proceedings have been halted. Charges have not been confirmed, because this claim scuttled what would have been the confirmation hearing late September this year. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Duterte remains in jail, loses ICC appeal",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/icc-appeals-chamber-denies-rodrigo-duterte-interim-release/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Unemployment dropped to 4.4% in November 2025 amid seasonal employment during the holidays, the Philippine Statistics Authority reported on Wednesday, January 7. The latest jobless rate is equivalent to 2.25 million Filipinos, lower than the 5% or 2.54 million jobless Filipinos recorded in October but higher than the 3.2% or 1.66 million unemployed Filipinos logged in November 2024. Meanwhile, underemployment also eased to 10.4% or 5.11 million Filipinos from 12% or 5.81 million underemployed Filipinos recorded in October 2025. National Statistician Dennis Mapa said the public administration and defense sector and the education sector added the most jobs year-on-year, employing around 185,000 and 176,000 more workers, respectively. But the accommodation and food services sector as well as the wholesale and retail trade sector shed the most jobs as the economy grappled with the impact of Typhoon Tino (Kalmaegi) and Super Typhoon Uwan (Fung-wong) in November. Mapa said restaurants (-191,000), short-term accommodations (-76,000), and event catering (-23,000) shed the most jobs. “Ang reading namin is that because of these [tropical cyclones], nagkaroon ng slowdown in economic activities related to tourism, doon sa accommodation services at of course, ‘yung retail trade,” he explained. (Our reading is that there was a slowdown in economic activities related to tourism because of these tropical cyclones, particularly in accommodation services and of course, retail trade.) The Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) also estimated that Tino and Uwan affected some 873,000 workers. Mapa further noted that the agriculture and forestry sector has lost 517,000 jobs since October. “Employment in the agricultural sector has always been sensitive to weather conditions,” he said in Filipino. Despite disruptions in the construction sector due to the flood control scandal, Mapa said they did not see a correlation between the ongoing corruption probe and job losses. In fact, the construction sector added around 143,000 jobs between October and November. To minimize business disruptions, DEPDev Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said the government will support businesses in crafting continuity and resiliency plans. He added that DEPDev is pushing for the full implementation of the Philippine Innovation Act to help develop more entrepreneurs and boost job demand. The country’s chief economist also said the government is prioritizing investments in skills development and lifelong learning to empower workers and allow them to weather economic shocks. Data from online job portal Jobstreet by SEEK found that candidates from call centers and customer service were the most active jobseekers on the platform, but administrative and office support roles were the most in-demand roles being recruited for. Meanwhile, jobseekers were on the lookout for jobs in engineering and education. “Strengthening workforce competitiveness is one of the key elements to attract investments that generate quality jobs,” Balisacan said. – with reports from Arriane dela Cruz/Rappler.com Arriane dela Cruz is a Rappler intern.

"United States President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have wrapped up a meeting in South Korea with a deal to keep Chinese rare earth exports flowing. Here are some basic facts about these obscure elements making headlines around the world: Rare earths are a group of 17 elements including 15 silvery-white metals called lanthanides, or lanthanoids, plus scandium and yttrium. Rare earths or the magnets which they are sometimes made into can be found in small but important quantities in everything from iPhones and washing machines to the F35 fighter jet. They are also used in electric vehicles (EVs), medical equipment, oil refining, and other military applications such as missiles and radar systems. Without them, supply chains quickly grind to a halt. Automakers were forced to paused some production earlier this year after Chinese export controls caused shortages. They are not rare in the sense that they are uncommon; some are more common than lead, for example. But they tend to be spread thin around the Earth’s crust in small quantities and mixed together or with other minerals, so larger deposits are difficult to find and costly to extract. While US scientists helped developed a process to separate and refine rare earths in the 1950s, China since the 1980s has come to dominate the industry thanks to lower costs, laxer environmental standards, and decades of government support. China accounts for about 60% of global mine production and 90% or more of refined production and rare earth magnet output. Projects are underway across the US, Europe, and Australia to build an alternative supply chain but it will take years to produce meaningful quantities. In the meantime, China is restricting exports of an increasing number of the elements and the equipment needed to mine and refine them. In their periodic table order, they are: scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium. Processing rare earths often involves the use of solvents, which can produce toxic waste that pollutes the soil, water, and atmosphere. More environmentally friendly technologies are being developed, but they are not yet widely used. Certain types of rare earth ores also contain radioactive thorium or uranium, which is often removed using acid. For this reason, development of the sector faces health and environmental regulatory hurdles. – Rappler.com",True,true,FAST FACTS: What are rare earths and why are they so important?,https://www.rappler.com/business/things-to-know-rare-earths-elements-names-meaning-uses-trade-china/,Rappler
"“My Queen, you are the fairest of them all.” This was the answer of the magic mirror every time the reigning queen asked this iconic question in the romanticized children’s literature of the Brothers Grimm, and popularized by the Disney movie, Snow White. But, like in the said fairy tale, comes a chilling turn: a new beauty has come of age and emerged to challenge the beauty of the reigning queen. Lifting the plot of Snow White into our stock market story book, the contest for “who is the fairest one of all” is now drawn between two identical investment beauties — that of the reigning listed water utility company and of the new beauty that is soon to debut in the same trading board. The old beauty is Manila Water Company Incorporated (MWC) which was listed in March 2005. The new beauty is no other than Maynilad Water Services Incorporated whose initial public offering (IPO) went underway last October 23 and ended yesterday, October 29, 2025, with its listing date scheduled on November 7, 2025 on the main board of the bourse under the trading symbol of “MYNLD.” The public equity offering involved the sale of 1.935 billion primary common shares and 0.354 billion secondary common shares held by the selling shareholder, Maynilad Water Holding Company Incorporated, for a total of about 2.289 billion shares. Out of the total offered shares of 2.289 billion shares, 0.628 billion or to be more exact 628,656,600 shares, were allotted to meet overhang demand broken down as follows: preferential offer of 24,904,800 primary common shares, an overallotment option of up to 249,047,600 primary common shares, and an upsize option of up to 354,704,200 secondary common shares. At the offer price of P15 per share, the total amount of the public offering (inclusive of the demand overhang options) is equivalent to P34.335 billion — the largest for 2025. The public offering has attracted support from major institutional domestic and international investors with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as lead cornerstone investors. As of this writing, the upsize option for secondary shares was fully exercised by both financial institutions. The entry of cornerstone investors is a significant development: it serves as a solid vote of confidence that the investment is credible and viable; their presence also serves to ensure a more stable market performance for the issue as cornerstone investors typically agree to a lock-up period where they cannot sell their shares immediately. Not to mention, a stabilization fund is also ready to prop up MYNLD’s market performance upon listing. The net proceeds from the public offering will be used largely for capital expenditures requirements and to some extent for general corporate purposes of the company. MYNLD is the water and wastewater services provider for the West Zone of the greater Metro Manila area. This covers the cities of Manila excluding the districts of Santa Ana and San Andres, Caloocan, Las Piñas, Malabon, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Pasay, and Parañaque except barangay of San Martin de Porres. It also covers three cities of Cavite province particularly Cavite City, Bacoor, and Imus and the municipalities of Kawit, Noveleta, and Rosario. MYNLD is the largest water concessionaire by active connections not only in the Philippines but the whole of Southeast Asia. As of June 30, 2025, the West Zone has a covered area of 540 square kilometers (sq. km) with a population of approximately 10.5 million people. It has 1.56 million billed connections of domestic and non-domestic customers, covering 94.8% of the West Zone’s population. Its concession agreement was granted in 1997 and was recently extended up to January 2047. MWC services the East Zone covering 1,400 sq. km of land area, which includes 24 cities and municipalities in Metro Manila and the province of Rizal. Covered in its service area are parts of the cities of Makati, Manila, and Quezon City, and the entire of Mandaluyong, Marikina, and Pateros. In Rizal, the company serves the city of Antipolo and districts of San Mateo and Angono. It currently services about 7.8 million people with 1.11 million billed connections as of the end of June 2025. Its concession agreement was also recently extended up to January 2047. (READ: Public interest, private hands: How Manila Water, Maynilad got the deal) In 2024, MWC reported P36.6 billion in service revenues while MYNLD reported a slightly lower service revenues of P33.5 billion. Both companies experienced revenue growth driven by factors such as implemented tariff adjustments and recovery of consumption in their respective service areas. However, MYNLD yielded a greater net income of P12.78 billion compared to MWC’s P10.97 billion due to its lighter debt portfolio. MYNLD’s cost of debt is reported to be “50bps lower” compared to that of MWC. For the first half of 2025, MYNLD reported a total revenue of P18.35 billion while MWC reported a P19.99-billion total revenue based on a respective average tariff of P68.2 P/cu.m. and P80.4 P/cu.m. Earnings before interest charges, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA was P12.74 billion (69.0% margin) for MYNLD and P14.58 billion (73.0% margin) for MWC, ending with a respective net income (NI) of P7.47 billion and P7.96 billion. With the reported net income, MYNLD drew a return on equity (ROE) of 10.0% and 21.0% for MWC. Estimated earnings per share (EPS) for MYNLD is P1.33 and P1.48 for MWC. NRW for MYNLD is 35.3% and 14.4% for MWC. NRW stands for Non-Revenue Water: it’s the water that has been treated and produced but is not billed to customers. It also includes all water lost due to leaks, illegal connections, meter errors, and other forms of theft or unaccounted-for usage. Reducing NRW is crucial for water utilities; it helps improve financial performance, reduce water wastage, and increase efficiency. Market response to the issue is reportedly good — especially from institutional investors. It’s said to be two times (2x) oversubscribed. Demand from “local small investors” (LSI), however, is patently almost absent. This is how metaphoric was the reaction of stockbroker Rene de los Reyes of Abacus Securities Corporation of the Abacus Capital & Investment Corporation group when given the choice to select between the two beauties: “At P15.00 a piece, Maynilad would be trading at 8.8x EV/EBITDA (EV stands for Enterprise Value). Applying that to MWC, its price per should be P49.78. The upside is very good, so I load up on MWC, and ignored MYNLD.” After buying a load, he said again: “I read from another review that MYNLD has a superior dividend yield; it’s 6.4% vs. 5.4% in favor of MYNLD. So, I have to beg even for some shares.” But just then, he was hit again by another bothering news: MYNLD’s dividend yield was not explicitly promised, but a forward-looking impression. In this connection, De Los Reyes had this to say to investors: Don’t get affected by what you read or hear. Stay focused on your main reason why you are investing in the stock issue. In the end, though, he concedes that MYNLD is a good dividend investment play. Jofer Gaite, president and chief trader of Westlink Global Equities Incorporated, totally agrees that MYNLD is a dividend play, all aspects considered. This is also the conclusion of his friend and former colleague Julian Tarrobago who is now on his own as founder and CEO of From Red to Green Investments — describing as well MYNLD as a boring investment with its anticipated stable market performance owing to its non-erratic and predictable revenue stream and cashflow. Andro Leo I. Beltran, vice president, First Metro Sec of the Metrobank Group had this to say: Due to the plans and programs of MYNLD, it can be considered as a core stock in your investment portfolio for the medium to long term. Also, MYNLD has a more superior dividend play vis-à-vis MWC. If it comes to a choice between the two, one’s overall growth and risk objectives should be used as determining factors. For Joel de la Peña, market strategist and chief trader of H.E. Bennett Securities Incorporated, while he is also interested in the issue, he finds MYNLD worth buying at a lower price than its offer price of P15 per share. This is the reason why he is not personally subscribing at the moment because he thinks — like most IPOs in the last 10 years or so — they tank upon listing, with most of them unable to go back even in their IPO offer price. Joey Roxas, president of Eagle Equities Incorporated, also agrees that MYNLD is a “Buy” and prefers it against MWC with its demonstrated operating ability even amidst historical challenges, plus the possibility that it can acquire PrimeWater from Manny Villar. He also begs to disagree with De La Peña that MYNLD will tank upon listing, citing the successful price stabilization strategies employed by present underwriters. (Rappler Investigates: Woeful PrimeWater) Wishing to be identified only as “M” at the moment, he especially detailed the three salient points — most of the other traders also — think will make MYNLD a better investment than MWC: “First, MYNLD has a higher dividend payout very good for cash-flow seekers; second, MYNLD has a much healthier balance sheet as of 1H25 at 1.0x D/E (debt-to-equity ratio), which will further improve to 0.6x post-IPO, compared to MWC’s 1.5x D/E. This will allow MYNLD to fund their substantial 2025-2027 CAPEX budget of P112.0 billon, which will be critical for the 7th rate rebasing period. Third, MYNLD’s opening cash position (OCP) of PHP100.4 billion vis-à-vis MWC’s P27.6 billion will result in higher tariff adjustments for the subsequent rebasing periods. The OCP is subjected to a 12% nominal rate of return over the course of the concession period until it goes to P0.00.” “Conversely, MWC has higher-quality assets and customers. Despite the East Concession Zone (MYNLD) is housing 10.5 million customers vs the West Concession Zone’s (MWC) 7.7 million billed volume stands relatively the same at 273 MCM (Million Cubic Meters) and 262 MCM, respectively. Furthermore, MYNLD has a long road ahead to improve its pipe infrastructure with non-revenue water at 36.7%. They aim to bring this down 20% by 2030.” In line with this, ‘M’ thinks that “there is upside for MYNLD on the listing day and thereafter, targeting it closer to the PH10y (Philippines 10-year Government Bond Yield)of 5.9%. This represents an upside of more than 10%. USD risks are minimal with most of their loans denominated in Peso and Yen.” With the exception of De la Peña, ‘M’ shares the same sentiments what the rest of the traders believe: MYNLD will not tank upon listing, it will not also be a flyer, but it will be “Climber.” – Rappler.com (The article has been prepared for general circulation for the reading public and must not be construed as an offer, or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or financial instruments whether referred to herein or otherwise.

"Last week, on November 7, the latest statistics on national income turned out to be a real shocker. For the third quarter of 2025, production only grew by a measly 4% from the previous year. This is the lowest quarterly growth rate of the country since 2011 (if you don’t count the pandemic). This is also very low compared to the target of the economic managers. Back in 2022, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. targeted growth this year to be 6–8%. But when that proved unattainable, his economic managers lowered the target to 5.5–6.5%. Now, even 5.5% seems to be a moonshot: to achieve that, production in the last quarter of 2025 will have to grow by 7%! Palace spokesperson Claire Castro somehow insists this can still be done — a case of what I might call “delulunomics.” If you break down of the data, you’ll see that the third quarter of 2025 is also notable as the first quarter since the pandemic where the growth contribution of investment spending dropped. In other words, investment spending pulled down growth. A further parsing of the data will reveal that this is also the second consecutive quarter where government construction spending slumped and pulled down total investments. You might interpret this as the government being a lot more cautious in public works spending, amid the flood control scandal that President Marcos himself announced to the world back in July. This brings to mind the administration of the late Benigno Aquino III, whose anti-corruption slogan meant overly cautious government spending in the early 2010s. (This prompted them to implement the Disbursement Acceleration Program or DAP, later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.) One wonders: How much of economic growth is being propped up by corrupt spending? If you take away corruption, will economic growth in the past few years have been a lot lower? Worse, is there a trade-off after all between growth and corruption? On the one hand, we’re seeing years where growth is high but corruption-ridden. On the other hand, growth is weaker because the government is stamping out corruption. Is it too much to ask for high and corruption-free growth? When asked about anemic growth, President Marcos said that other factors are at play, including the multiple class and work suspensions (owing to disasters) and the fallout of Trump’s tariffs. This echoes what his chief economist said a week prior. Sure, the effects of climate change are getting more intense (as evidenced by Typhoon Tino and Super Typhoon Uwan) and Trump’s tariffs are souring the global business environment. But there’s something broken in our own backyard, and it’s getting harder and harder to deny it. Other indicators of economic malaise include the historically weak peso. On November 14, the exchange rate reached P59.11 per US dollar (as of writing) and it seems the Bangko Sentral is not too worried to let the exchange rate cross the psychological threshold of P60 per US dollar. As I wrote last week, one reason for a weaker peso is stronger demand for dollars, and this usually happens when investors want to pick up their money and invest elsewhere. Data from the Bangko Sentral also reported a steep drop of foreign direct investments (FDI): a massive 40.5% drop from August 2024 to August 2025, and a similarly alarming 22.5% drop from January to August 2024 to the same period in 2025. I can’t help but remember the numerous foreign trips made by President Marcos at the start of his presidency, supposedly to attract investments. Years later, that would be undone by large-scale corruption that he allowed to fester. So those foreign trips were useless, after all, and proved to be mere junkets that “reintroduced” the Marcoses on the global stage. In many ways, it’s not so surprising that corruption is festering under yet another Marcos presidency. But it’s also unsurprising to see that his efforts so far to curb corruption have been weak as hell. On November 13, President Marcos appeared in a press conference to update the country about his anti-corruption drive. He boasted about the 20,000 or so complaints received on the online portal “Sumbong sa Pangulo,” and encouraged people to keep on filing reports about anomalous flood control projects. But in launching this website, the President essentially outsourced the investigation to citizens, when in fact his office should be able to scan all flood control projects and pinpoint those which have been corrupted. Remember, his office sits on top of billions of pesos worth of confidential and intelligence funds! More than receiving reports, people expect Marcos to jail the corrupt. But it’s been more than three months since his State of the Nation Address, and everyone is still scot-free. Former lawmaker Zaldy Co is still globetrotting, and former public works secretary Manuel Bonoan has flown to the US. When asked about his cousin Martin Romualdez, former speaker of the House of Representatives, architect of the corrupted national budgets since 2023, President Marcos could not have been more evasive. Instead, Marcos seems to be zeroing in on small-fry scapegoats such as the conjugal contractors, Sarah and Curlee Discaya. Here in the Philippines, it’s notoriously difficult to hold public officials accountable. Heck, Filipinos keep electing the corrupt or giving them even more power than before (think Imelda Marcos and Juan Ponce Enrile, who [finally] passed away yesterday at age 101). Don’t get your hopes up that the real masterminds in the flood control mess will be jailed. And don’t get your hopes up that our economy will magically recover any time soon. – Rappler.com (Editor’s note: This article was written before Zaldy Co, in a video released on Friday, November 14, tagged President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and former House speaker Martin Romualdez in corrupting the 2025 national budget.)

"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – OpenAI is laying the groundwork for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, three people familiar with the matter said, in what could be one of the biggest IPOs of all time. OpenAI is considering filing with securities regulators as soon as the second half of 2026, some of the people said. In preliminary discussions, the company has looked at raising $60 billion at the low end and likely more, the people said. They cautioned that talks are early and plans — including the figures and timing — could change depending on business growth and market conditions. Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar has told some associates the company is aiming for a 2027 listing, the people said. But some advisers predict it could come even sooner, around late 2026. “An IPO is not our focus, so we could not possibly have set a date,” an OpenAI spokesperson said. “We are building a durable business and advancing our mission so everyone benefits from AGI.” The IPO preparations signal a new urgency inside the ChatGPT maker to tap public markets now that a complex restructuring is complete that reduces its reliance on Microsoft. An IPO would open the door to more efficient capital raising and enable larger acquisitions using public stock, helping to finance CEO Sam Altman’s plans to pour trillions of dollars into AI infrastructure, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking. With an annualized revenue run rate expected to reach about $20 billion by year-end, losses are also mounting inside the $500 billion company, the people said. During a livestream on Tuesday, Altman addressed the possibility of going public. “I think it’s fair to say it is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we’ll have,” he said. OpenAI started out as a nonprofit in 2015. A few years later, the company overhauled its structure again so that the nonprofit would have oversight and control over the for-profit arm. The main goal of the nonprofit was to ensure that OpenAI developed AI technology safely, rather than prioritizing profits like a traditional company. This week, OpenAI revamped itself yet again. It is still controlled by a nonprofit, now called the OpenAI Foundation, but the nonprofit has a 26% stake in OpenAI Group and a warrant to receive additional shares if the company hits certain milestones. This change makes the nonprofit a significant stakeholder in OpenAI’s financial success. A successful offering would mark a major win for investors such as SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX. Microsoft, one of its biggest backers, now owns about 27% of the company after investing $13 billion. The deliberations come as AI is driving a surge in public markets. Earlier this year, AI cloud company CoreWeave went public at a $23 billion valuation and has roughly tripled since. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market value, powered by a rally that has cemented its role at the center of the global AI boom. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the possibility of OpenAI going public as early as 2027. – Rappler.com",True,true,OpenAI lays groundwork for juggernaut IPO at up to $1-trillion valuation,https://www.rappler.com/technology/openai-lays-groundwork-initial-public-offering/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Michael V has suited up to portray controversial figure Sarah Discaya after social media users pointed out his striking resemblance to the public works contractor. Discaya made headlines anew in early September when she admitted during a Senate probe that there were instances when her nine construction firms bid for the same government flood control projects. The businesswoman had initially denied the allegations, but after further prodding from Senator Jinggoy Estrada (who was later tagged in alleged flood control kickbacks in Bulacan), Discaya admitted the scheme. But it wasn’t just Discaya’s revelation that stuck out to the public — it was her resemblance to popular Kapuso comedian Michael V. Memes comparing the two figures’ features had begun to surface, and before long, GMA gag show Bubble Gang teased footage and photos of Michael V dressed in a similar garb as that of Discaya’s. In the photos posted by Bubble Gang, Michael V had on a wig mimicking Discaya’s hairstyle, two moles in the same spots Discaya has them on her face, glasses, and similar outfit — consisting of an inner top and blazer. In one photo, Michael V was also holding an umbrella, seemingly alluding to Discaya’s statement in an interview with TV and YouTube personality Julius Babao that she bought one of her luxury vehicles, a Rolls-Royce, because she liked the umbrella built into the car door. Michael V’s character was named Ciala Dismaya, a play on Sarah Discaya’s name, appearing to be referring to the Filipino slang term of shala (meaning fancy) and dismaya (disappointment). The Discayas’ legal counsel, Cornelio Samaniego III, told GMA News that Sarah is aware of Michael V’s impersonation of her. Samaniego debunked rumors that Discaya was angry at the comedian for the skit — adding that the businesswoman is okay with it. The Bubble Gang episode will premiere on Sunday, September 14, at 6:10 pm on GMA Network. Sarah Discaya’s construction firms have since been disqualified from bidding for government projects. The former Pasig City mayoral candidate and her husband, Pacifico “Curlee” Discaya, have also expressed their desire to become state witnesses in the flood control project scandal.

"When was the last time you entered a room and felt the weight of responsibility and possibility at the same time? As an Asia 21 fellow this year, I asked myself this as I walked into the Asia 21 Next Generation Fellows Summit this December 5 to 7 held in Manila, my first gathering as part of the 2025 cohort. I had imagined the moment for years. Back in college, I remember reading about Asia 21 Fellows who were shaping policy, building communities, and challenging systems. I followed their stories like a student studying constellations that are visible, distant, but guiding. And suddenly, there I was, no longer just looking up at the stars but meeting them, learning with them, and realizing I now shared the responsibility to shine. The summit, organized by Asia Society Philippines and led by Natalie Ching Jorge, Doris Magsaysay Ho, and Fernando Zobel De Ayala, was a powerful reminder that leadership isn’t a title, it’s a lifelong practice of courage, humility, and service. Standing beside co-fellows I had only ever read about (including my 2025 co-fellow Filipino classmate Kenneth Abante), I felt the quiet thrill of belonging to a circle of people who still believe that change is possible, that institutions can evolve, and that communities deserve leaders who listen as much as they act. The Asia Society website framed our selection as a recognition of courageous leadership. But for me, it felt more like an invitation: now that you are here, what will you do with this space? The question followed me all the way to Palawan for the Asia 21 travel caravan. And as if the universe wanted to insist on an answer, it sent us two Filipino Asia 21 Fellows whose journeys could fill entire books. Amina Swananpoel (Class of 2011), executive director of Roots of Health, has dedicated her life to reproductive rights, dignity, and women’s health in Palawan, a work that is rarely glamorous but always life-changing. Walking through their clinic and community spaces felt like stepping inside a living manifesto of compassion. Her work reminds us that development is not measured in impressive metrics but in whether people feel safer, healthier, and more human. Then there was Quintin Pastrana (Class of 2008), someone I had long admired from afar for his clean energy advocacy and his leadership in Sabang Renewable Energy Corporation. Seeing Sabang’s microgrid in person, an award-winning model of hybrid renewable power, was grounding. Quintin didn’t just talk about climate solutions; he built one in a place where energy once meant diesel, darkness, or none at all. Quintin and I had the chance to briefly talk about collaboration for climate solutions, a conversation that felt less like planning and more like anchoring shared values. He also mentioned something that delighted me: the capstone of Asian Institute Management MDM graduates — Carl Vincent Gapasin, Xien Palacios and Novee Nalica. Their research explores how solar panels can coexist with agriculture, a topic that mirrors the very spirit of Sabang’s hybrid systems. Knowing about their academic work intersects with real-world energy transitions reminded me that the pipeline of Filipino climate innovators is stronger than we think. Sometimes, all they need is a platform, and mentors like Quintin who are willing to lift them into the conversation. What do we teach in business school, really? Two weeks before Palawan and the Summit, I stepped into another room, this time as keynote speaker at the National Business Management Conference of De La Salle University and the Philippine Academy of Management. It was a gathering of scholars, deans, researchers, and students. And in my mind, I carried the faces of farmers I work with, entrepreneurs trying to survive, and community leaders who measure success in meals fed, hectares restored, or dreams made possible. So, I asked the room a question I ask myself often: Do we teach business to make profit, or do we teach business to make impact? This wasn’t rhetorical. It was an invitation to rethink the systems that shape young leaders at the very beginning of their trajectories. For decades, business education has been framed around competition, market share, and bottom lines. But in a world facing climate breakdown, inequity, and fragility, what kind of leaders are we producing if we don’t anchor the curriculum in justice, sustainability, and human dignity? In my keynote, I shared what we have been building through Varacco, ThinnkFarm, and our Smart FARM and Smart CAFE projects: that businesses can be profitable and transformative; that technology — IoT, drones, nano-biofertilizers — can be democratized for farmers; that growth can be regenerative, not extractive. Platforms like the National Business Management Conference and PAoM matter because they create space for dialogue. They allow professors, researchers, and practitioners to ask uncomfortable questions, interrogate outdated frameworks, and co-design future-ready models. Amid the complexity of our time, these spaces remind us that business can still be a force for good, if we intentionally teach it that way. Looking back, the past weeks felt like a single arc stitched across three locations: A summit hall in Manila, where young leaders gathered with clarity and conviction. A microgrid in Palawan, reminding me of what climate solutions look like when they reach the people who need them most. A conference stage in De La Salle, where I stood before academics and asked them, and myself — what kind of leaders we must nurture for the next decade. (READ: Supporting social enterprises with a purpose: Should we?) In every space, one theme emerged: courageous leadership is not about being the smartest person in the room; it is about being the most accountable to the future. Meeting Amina re-centered me on dignity. Learning from Quintin re-energized me on climate action. Seeing the brilliance of AIM graduates like Carl, Xien, and Novee reminded me that the next generation is already experimenting with the ideas that will define the Philippines’ sustainable future. And speaking to educators and scholars challenged me to imagine a business landscape where young entrepreneurs do not have to choose between profit and purpose, because the ecosystem teaches them to integrate both. I return to the question I asked at the summit: Now that you are here, what will you do with this space? For me, the answer is simple: keep building, keep convening, keep learning, and keep connecting the threads, between fellows and farmers, between energy systems and education, between research and real life. Spaces like Asia 21, Roots of Health, Sabang’s microgrid, and the national business conference are not just events; they are reminders that progress is collaborative. That no leader moves alone. That the world is held up by communities of people quietly doing the work, even when the world is not watching. And if there is anything this season has taught me, it is this: “Hope is not a feeling. It is a practice. And courageous leadership is one of its fiercest forms.” – Rappler.com Ariestelo Asilo is recently named an Asia 21 Next Generation Fellow 2025.

"MANILA, Philippines – In one of the rare infrastructure undertakings of the Sy family, Iloilo City in Western Visayas now has public markets redeveloped by SM Prime Holdings Incorporated, the Philippines’ largest mall developer and operator founded by the late Henry Sy. Built under a public-private partnership (PPP), Iloilo City and SM Prime opened to the public on October 30 the redeveloped Iloilo Central Market, also known as Tienda Mayor, and the Iloilo Terminal Market, the bagsakan or drop-off area for goods traded in Panay Island. The two markets, built decades ago, are located in Iloilo City’s Cultural Tourism Heritage Zone and Historic Center. The redevelopment seeks to preserve and enhance the city’s old commercial business district and help improve the city’s tourism. From drab and unsightly, the new markets have been transformed into bright and clean spaces for the city’s micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). “Before, the old market’s condition was really difficult for us. When it rained, everything got wet, and our regular customers found it inconvenient,” said Jedda Navales, a native coffee vendor. “Now, with the new Iloilo Terminal Market, we’re finally leveling up.” SM Prime spent P3 billion to redevelop the two buildings, which it described as “two of the city’s historic public spaces.“ With additional floors, the Iloilo Central Market now has a gross floor area (GFA) of 17,000 square meters, while the Iloilo Terminal Market has a GFA of 20,000 sqm. The redevelopment projects, solicited for PPP by the local government unit, were undertaken at no cost to the Iloilo City government. SM Prime president Jeffrey Lim said the projects do not signify a new business field for the conglomerate. “This is more to support entrepreneurs which is part of how we do business and as we move to provincial areas so we can create shared growth between us and the MSMEs,” Lim said in a press briefing on Monday, November 10. Lim added that SM Prime currently has no other public market redevelopment projects in its pipeline, but that it is open to working with other local government units (LGUs) to help local entrepreneurs. The PPP was signed in August 2022 between then-Iloilo City mayor Jerry Treñas and SM Prime, and the projects were opened to the public by his successor, daughter Raisa Treñas-Chu, and SM Engineering Design and Development president Hans Sy Jr., a grandson of SM founder Henry Sy. The redevelopment of the Iloilo Central Market, built in the 1920s, expanded the central market section, increasing the space available for vendors (fish and meat, dried fish, flower shops, rice and grains, frozen food) from 529 to 850. This area will be managed by the Iloilo City government. Unlike before, the Iloilo Central Market now has ramps and an elevator for easier access to the two upper floors. In addition, the Iloilo Central Market now has 61 long-term leasable spaces and communal areas which will be handled by SM Prime and from which it hopes to recover its investment. SM Prime said this area includes dining areas where Ilonggo dishes such as batchoy and pancit molo will be available. Iloilo is the Philippines’ first UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy. The Iloilo Terminal Market’s market section, on the other hand, now has spaces for 1,160 vendors from the previous 911. Plus, it now has a lifestyle center in the upper floors with 58 long-term leasable spaces to be handled by SM Prime. SM Supermalls president Steven Tan said the the redeveloped public markets will be fully operational by the end of November. He said the focus in the redevelopment was on hygiene “making sure everything was clean,” including recycling, the sewage treatment plant, and water supply, and improving access. “We have professionalized this and we added more parking to make it more convenient for people who go to the market,” Tan said. “This day marks an important milestone in the history of Iloilo City, a new beginning for our vendors and shoppers. Everything is organized, clean, bright and well-ventilated,” said Treñas-Chu during the soft opening ceremony on October 30. “This project raises the bar and serves as a model of how the private and public sectors can work hand in hand to deliver meaningful, lasting benefits for communities,” the LGU also said in a statement. In a statement on September 22, the Iloilo City Local Economic Enterprise Office (LEEO) clarified that the Iloilo Central Market was “not privatized.” “SM will only manage their designated area, while the rest of the market operations remain under the Local Economic Enterprise Office (LEEO),” it said. It also denied that rent for each of the market space will go up from P900 per month to P5,000 per month. “No such increase has been implemented. In fact, under Executive Order No. 21, the City Government has deferred any adjustment in market rental rates for two years, covering 2025 to 2026,” the LGU office said. SM Prime will manage and maintain the facility under a 25-year lease with the Iloilo City government. – Rappler.com",True,true,"If SM were to redevelop your city’s palengke, what would it look like?",https://www.rappler.com/business/sm-redevelopment-iloilo-central-terminal-market-opens/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — Nearly four years after IKEA opened in Pasay City the world’s biggest IKEA branch, the Swedish home furnishing brand cemented its presence in the northern part of Metro Manila, with a new concept shop now open in TriNoma Mall, Quezon City. IKEA and Ayala Malls collaborated to bring the first-ever “Plan and Order Shop” to the country, just six months after the two teams’ first meeting. More than a place to shop for homeware and furniture, the smaller Quezon City branch also has a new planning studio. This allows customers to consult with planning specialists on how to arrange their homes with the right furniture and home decor pieces, even if it’s a tight-knit space. Customization is at the center of this new home improvement experience. “[The Plan and Order Shop] is a quite brand new concept for IKEA in our retail operation. It’s a way to bring our range closer to the many Filipinos,” said IKEA Philippines country retail manager Ricardo Pinheiro at the branch opening on October 23, Thursday. Apart from accessibility to different sectors with its free planning service, Swedish Ambassador-Designate Anna Ferry also emphasized the store’s display of the core values that IKEA and Sweden stand for. “Most importantly, [IKEA promotes a] business sector [that] is ethically sustainable, oriented with people and the planet in mind,” she said. Ferry highlighted the trust and belief IKEA has in the Philippines, as seen in its willingness to invest and expand stores in the country through the opening of the Plan and Order Shop. Also present at the branch opening, Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte pointed out the opportunities for the new IKEA branch with its strategic location in the northern part of the capital region. “[Quezon City is] the largest city in the Philippines with a population of 3.2 million. As said earlier, all of [IKEA’s] customers, or many of [IKEA’s] customers in Pasay are actually from [here],” she said. She added the advantage of the branch’s location at the center of other big local government units. With the city recently being recognized as the Hall of Fame Awardee for being one of the most business-friendly LGUs in the country, the IKEA branch is further proof of the LGU’s move towards growth in the business sector. Belmonte also acknowledged the Ayala Corporation, which she says has been a “close partner of the local government of Quezon City” and has ensured continuous progress in Quezon City. Mariana Zobel de Ayala, currently head of the Leasing and Hospitality Group of Ayala, shared that TriNoma was a mall intentionally built for the city and its people. “We really wanted to serve the dynamic and incredible, and large community that’s here in Quezon City,” she said. With the Plan and Order shop’s location, its services have become within reach of Quezon City’s diverse population living in condos, townhouses, and smaller houses. Zobel de Ayala emphasized that the partnership with IKEA is more than just a business expansion. Beyond offering accessibility to Quezon City and northern residents, she said that the Plan and Order Shop format aligns with IKEA’s vision of inclusive and customer-centric spaces that “elevate everyday life.” “Over the past year, we’ve been looking to move with purpose. [We] reimagine our goals beyond just commercial centers, but really, as the vibrant and future-ready destinations that will continue to inspire, to push, and to engage all of the communities that we serve.” Housing IKEA’s second branch is only one of the steps the Ayala Group is taking towards transforming TriNoma into a space that addresses the lifestyle and needs of its community. – Alyana Fabella/Rappler.com Alyana Fabella is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the Ateneo de Manila University.",True,true,What IKEA’s new TriNoma branch means for QC’s bustling business scene,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/style/ikea-philippines-plan-order-shop-trinoma-quezon-city/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Tourism (DOT) and TikTok Philippines on Tuesday, October 21, signed a memorandum of agreement to help micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) promote their goods and services on the social media platform. The DOT and TikTok Philippines’ collaboration entails training DOT-accredited vendors on short-form video content creation and online marketing through a series of workshops nationwide. The collaboration will target MSMEs such as small hotels, travel agencies, souvenir shops, and tourism groups. DOT Secretary Christina Frasco said the first training camp will be held through a one-day hybrid setup in November for 50 MSMEs in Metro Manila and Cebu. Frasco, who hails from Cebu, said the province’s tourism sector had been devastated by the recent earthquakes that devastated Bogo City and the province’s other northern areas. The tourism chief added that the end goal of the DOT’s partnership with TikTok is to increase the revenues and market penetration of MSMEs in the sector, which she hopes will translate into more tourist arrivals. The Philippines logged 2.9 million arrivals in the first half of 2025, and the tourism sector is expected to contribute P2.7 trillion to the Philippine economy this year.

"MANILA, Philippines – Retired air force general Romeo Poquiz was arrested upon landing at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) over a warrant of arrest from an inciting to sedition charge filed against him by the Philippine National Police (PNP). Poquiz’s lawyer Ferdinand Topacio was in the process of posting the P48,000 bail at the Quezon City Regional Trial Court when Rappler spoke to him past noon on Monday, January 5. Poquiz was arrested in NAIA past 8 am on Monday after arriving from a weeks-long family vacation in Thailand. “We just need his physical presence [in the court], I hope [he can be released within the day],” Topacio told Rappler over the phone. Poquiz is an outspoken critic of the Marcos administration, and is allied with groups supporting former president Rodrigo Duterte. He is a lead organizer of the September rallies against infrastructure corruption, but ones which were perceived to be politically motivated to elevate the Duterte bloc over Marcos. The rallies of their group, United People’s Initiative (UPI), was heavily scrutinized by both the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the local city government of Quezon City for alleged speeches that incite to sedition. The Quezon City government stopped the third day of the UPI rallies in November for alleged seditious tendencies. Poquiz’s name was also floated as one of the alleged instigators of a planned coup last November, but he has since clarified that his group spoke to AFP chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. “only to air our legitimate grievances,” and not to urge the military to withdraw its support for Marcos, he told One News on November 19. “I did not,” Poquiz said when asked if he specifically tried to convince Brawner to withdraw military support. But according to Poquiz’s lawyer, Levito Baligod, the complaint filed by the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) stemmed from a Facebook post, and not the UPI protests, nor the discussion with Brawner. The Facebook post, Baligod said, read: “Kailangan mag-seryoso ang gobyerno na mag-imbestiga sa anomalya dahil kung hindi, baka isipin ng mga tao na ang mastermind ay nasa Malacañang.” (The government needs to be serious in investigating the anomalies because if not, Filipinos might think that the mastermind is in Malacañang.) Rebellion and inciting to sedition complaints were filed, but only the latter charge progressed at the Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 77. The first hearing over the complaint was on October 15, and the warrant was issued way back December 5. Under Article 139 of the Revised Penal Code, sedition is “committed by persons who rise publicly and tumultuously in order to attain by force” actions that threaten government and social stability. “Inciting” under Article 142 is defined as “any person who, without taking any direct part in the crime of sedition, should incite others to the accomplishment of any of the acts which constitute sedition, by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, emblems, cartoons, banners, or other representations tending to the same end.” The Duterte administration also used this legal tool to go after critics. Staunch Duterte critic Antonio Trillanes IV was also charged of the same, and again this time, state prosecutors used the rule of “dangerous tendency.” In the Trillanes case, which he has since been cleared of, state prosecutors said there was dangerous tendency “when the words uttered or published could easily produce disaffection among the people and a state of feeling in them incompatible with a disposition to remain loyal to the government and obedient to the laws.” Ironically for Poquiz who is allied with pro-Duterte groups, state prosecutors also used the dangerous tendency rule against him. “The city prosecutor used an obsolete standard in evaluating whether the utterance incited or not [to sedition.] The city prosecutor used the old standard dangerous tendency, but there have been many Supreme Court decisions removing that standard, and we have a new standard called ‘clear and present danger’,” Baligod told Rappler. Clear and present danger, according to Supreme Court jurisprudence, has a two-way test: Duterte, during his presidency, cracked down on all kinds of dissent too, which for free speech advocates did not meet the clear and present danger standard. It’s not the first time that Marcos has used the same Duterte playbook against critics. Even protesters during his inauguration in 2022 were threatened with the same charges, and then again against the progressive bloc of protesters during the November 30 anti-corruption rally last year. Baligod said the charges were filed in court even though they had filed a motion for reconsideration (MR) before the Department of Justice (DOJ), which is still pending. Generally, prosecutors wait for the resolution of an MR to file charges in court, but the Duterte-time DOJ had often opted not to wait, too. – Rappler.com",True,true,Retired general arrested for inciting to sedition for Facebook post vs Marcos,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/retired-general-romeo-poquiz-arrested-inciting-sedition/,Rappler
"On Thursday, October 9, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Francis Lim apologized for citing a “fictitious” industry report that claimed the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) lost P1.7 trillion in market value in just three weeks in August. August was when President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. shared that just 15 contractors bagged contracts to 20% of all flood control projects nationwide. The chief of the corporate watchdog cited the fake figure during a speech at a Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines forum this week, where he also noted that investors were leaving the Philippines due to weak integrity. Lim has since retracted his statement, saying he fell victim to the fake report that was circulating within business circles. “I deeply regret any confusion or concern that my statement may have caused. My sole intent was to underscore the vital importance of integrity in our markets and the devastating impact corruption can have on investor confidence,” he said in a statement on Thursday, October 9. Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs Frederick Go, earlier on Thursday, dismissed Lim’s claims, saying that the SEC chief cited a fake report that has since been disowned by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) market intelligence unit. So, how much market value was really wiped out in the weeks Lim referenced in his speech? PSE president Ramon Monzon clarified that the PSE lost around P185 billion in market capital in those three weeks. The local bourse’s weekly reports logged the following market capitalization figures since Marcos launched the Sumbong sa Pangulo website: Despite the erroneous figure in Lim’s speech, Monzon agreed with the SEC chief’s sentiments that corruption has hurt investor confidence. “​​That being said, SEC Chairman Francis Ed. Lim is correct in assailing the level of corruption in the country, and its adverse effects on the economy and financial markets,” he noted. According to Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation’s chief economist Michael Ricafort, the PSE’s composite index PSEi declined by at least 5% since Marcos’ fourth State of the Nation Address in July. Waning business confidence also led the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to cut the country’s policy rate by 0.25% to just 4.75% in its latest monetary policy meeting, in a bid to reverse the fall. “The stock market has declined, and there are now fewer companies with expansion plans. Weaker growth means weaker demand and lower inflation,” said BSP Governor Eli Remolona Jr. Ricafort explained in an email to Rappler that the latest rate cut was one of the offsetting factors for the PSEi on Thursday’s trade. He emphasized the importance of boosting economic growth through monetary easing measures in order to make borrowing costs cheaper. This, in turn, will increase demand for credit to spur investments, employment, and other activities that will boost economic growth. In a Thursday press briefing, the BSP also called for what Remolona described as a credible resolution to the corruption scandal. BSP Deputy Governor Zeno Abenoja also mentioned reforms in the implementation of future national budgets that ensure projects are properly implemented. “We would like to see, for example, for the 2026 to 2027 budget, in the implementation, what is allotted for certain key items will result in full implementation of this project, less leakages. That would improve the outlook for domestic demand, and that could support the economy moving forward,” he said. – Rappler.com",True,true,How much market value did the PSE really lose amid flood control projects mess?,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/pse-market-value-lost-flood-control-projects-scandal/,Rappler
"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia – Trade negotiations between the Philippines and United States continue three months after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. trekked to Washington, DC, to meet US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Malaysia on Monday, October 27, Palace press officer Undersecretary Claire Castro said there are “comprehensive issues” that must be tackled first, as the two nations iron out the fine details of the agreement. Castro was citing Frederick Go, Marcos’ special assistant for investment and economic affairs. The issues, Go told Castro, include trade rules and regulations, non-tariff measures such as services and investments, and products that the Philippines wants to “protect” such as rice, sugar, and chicken, and exports such as coconuts, pineapple, electronics. “At ‘yan po, ilan po ito sa mga hindi po sa ngayon makakayang i-negotiate ng basta-basta ng Pilipinas. So nando’n pa rin po ang pakikipag-usap para po ‘yung ibang mga produkto natin ay hindi na nga po maapektuhan,” said Castro. (So those are among the reasons why, for now, it’s hard for the Philippines to negotiate [with the US]. We are still in discussions to ensure that our products are not affected [adversely].) On the sidelines of the 47th ASEAN Summit, the United States signed trade agreements with the bloc’s chair Malaysia, as well as Cambodia. The US also signed framework trade deals with Vietnam and Thailand. In late July 2025, following a meeting with Marcos in the Oval Office, Trump announced a 19% rate for the Philippines, and claimed zero tariffs for US products entering the Philippines. Prior to that meeting, Trump announced the US would be imposing a 20% tariff on Philippine products, a rate that was three percentage points higher than the 17% that was initially planned to be imposed on Manila. The 19% rate was meant to kick in on August 1. Negotiations have been ongoing since then.

"MANILA, Philippines – Acquisition by another tycoon. That’s the response of the troubled PrimeWater to mounting grievances by its millions of consumers who now call the Villar-led company “crime water.” The Villar group confirmed on Tuesday, December 16, that 100% of PrimeWater had been acquired by Crystal Bridges Holding Corporation, the investment firm of Puregold tycoon Lucio Co. Crystal Bridges is owned by Co’s children, with Puregold heir Vincent Co as chairman and president, according to the company’s 2025 general information sheet. “Crystal Bridges Holding Corporation of the Lucio Co Group has entered into definitive agreements for the acquisition of 100% of PrimeWater Infrastructure Corp,” the Villar group said in a statement Tuesday. Crystal Bridges will take over in the middle of multiple investigations and local governments wanting to preterminate all over the country. On the ground in Bacolod City, consumers are frustrated by the sale. “Now that PrimeWater is in hot water, it is simply being sold to another private entity. Is this the solution? Where is the accountability? Will PrimeWater be allowed to walk away without consequences? Is this yet another attempt to fool the Bacolodnons?” the Bacolod City Water District Employees Union said in a statement. Bacolod City just averted a major water crisis this weekend. PrimeWater had not paid three months of outstanding bills to its water supplier, and the subcontractor had threatened to cut the water line. Emergency negotiations ended in a clutch commitment by PrimeWater to pay on Saturday, December 13, or a day after the deadline. PrimeWater not paying its subcontractors is not an isolated incident as Rappler had reported on another contractor involved in at least two water districts. Senator Raffy Tulfo, chair of the Senate public works committee investigating PrimeWater’s failure of obligations in at least half of its nearly 80 joint venture agreements, had also cited another case of an unpaid contractor. In Himamaylan, Negros Occidental, the local council wants full transparency of what the Co group’s acquisition will entail. Vice Mayor Justin Dominic Gatuslao told Rappler over a phone call on Wednesday, December 17, that the local government was not informed beforehand, and that “it turns out even the members of the board of the water district were not aware of the transaction.” Gatuslao said the next move of the council will be to ask the water district for the strategy with the Co group. “What are our non-negotiables and what is it that we want to push considering that we want to take this as a new opportunity, a fresh start so that we can finally take off from a solid foundation?” said Gatuslao, who described the Villar group operation as “definitely a failure.” In San Fernando, Pampanga, Mayor Vilma Caluag told Rappler over a phone call Tuesday evening that they are not keen on giving PrimeWater a second chance even with different management. The mayor appealed to the new owners, “Palayain na nila kami, pakawalan na nila kami, nagmakakaawa ako sa kanila para naman mabawasan naman ang challenges namin sa siyudad ng San Fernando.” (Free us, let us go, I’m begging them, so we could ease the challenges we face here in the city of San Fernando.) Caluag unilaterally suspended PrimeWater’s business permit in her city, which is now being pitched as a blueprint for other localities that want out of the 25-year deal. The water district, which is under the Local Water Utilities Administration, had also preterminated the contract, according to Caluag. But PrimeWater’s technique has always been to take to court whoever attempts to break free, and “most of the time,” they win, said Tulfo during a Senate hearing. Caluag said PrimeWater had been allowed three catch-up plans in San Fernando, but services did not improve. Since doing a full offensive on PrimeWater, Caluag said the constituents have experienced some relief in water services. “Ayaw na naming magkasuhan, wala naman kaming ibubuga kapag kasuhan na. Sana palayain na lang nila kami, makapag-move on na kami, at makapagtrabaho na kami nang maayos.” (We don’t want a legal battle anymore, we don’t stand a chance. So, I hope they let us go so we can move on, and we can get to work.) In metropolitan La Union, the water district is still locked in a legal battle over pretermination. The Water for the People Network La Union said the sale was just a “pure business transaction” that “did not answer fundamental questions” about the joint venture. “Hindi dapat payagan na makalusot lang ang mga Villar sa kanilang perwisyo sa mamamayan. Dapat pagbayarin sila ng danyos sa mga konsyumer na pinagkaitan nila ng maayos na serbisyo sa tubig,” the group said in a statement sent to Rappler on Wednesday. (We should not allow the Villars to get away with the damage they have caused the community. They should be made to pay damages to consumers they deprived of good water service.) Hospitality business owners in surf town San Juan, La Union, who have been impacted by the water disruptions, said that while the sale “may invite reassessment… the sale of PrimeWater does not extinguish existing service obligations.” “Consumers must not be made to shoulder the cost of PrimeWater’s operational and management failures,” said Monalisa Luebben-Binlot, president of the San Juan Resort Restaurant and Hotel Association. Prior to the acquisition, PrimeWater was wholly owned by Prime Asset Ventures of Manuel Paolo Villar, the son of former senator Manny Villar, and brother of senators Mark Villar and Camille Villar. It was during the time of Mark Villar as secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways under the Duterte administration when PrimeWater rapidly grew, increasing its joint venture agreements by five-fold. From 15 JVAs by the end of 2015, they now have 77 JVAs nationwide. Half have been wanting to forfeit PrimeWater’s performance bond, according to Rappler’s analysis of audit reports, and half have been wanting to preterminate the contracts, according to Tulfo’s survey of its partner water districts. Kabataan Representative Renee Co told Rappler in an earlier interview that PrimeWater under Villar should be criminally investigated “for estafa, syndicated estafa, and graft, if officials are involved.” “The government should freeze assets and require performance bonds to make sure contractors, water districts, and consumers get paid and protected,” said Co. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Lucio Co group buys troubled PrimeWater, consumers still aggrieved",https://www.rappler.com/business/lucio-vincent-co-buy-primewater/,Rappler
"A few days ago, the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) came out with smoking gun evidence that unprogrammed appropriations or funds have been used for infrastructure projects in at least the past two years. Prior to this, our closest confirmation came from an admission of House appropriations committee chair Mika Suansing. In a plenary session, Suansing said that “The UA releases for flood control projects for 2023 is P34 billion, and for 2024, it is P107 billion. So across 2023 and 2024, the UA releases for the flood control project is P141 billion.” But now, PCIJ has the goods. Specifically, PCIJ was able to get its hands on Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs). These documents are issued by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) authorizing the release of money for items lodged in unprogrammed funds. PCIJ found that P213.8 billion of unprogrammed funds were released for public works, and over half of them (52%) were for flood control, followed by roads and bridges (38%), and multipurpose buildings or facilities (8.5%). What’s more, in the SAROs they got, the stated purpose of these projects were “To cover the implementation of various priority projects which are crucial in ensuring the achievement of the President’s Eight-Point Socioeconomic Agenda.” In short, Marcos had a direct hand in approving anomalous flood control projects from start to finish: from the crafting of the proposed budget (National Expenditure Program) all the way to the release of SAROs. This only emphasizes the fact that he can’t wash his hands and feign ignorance or surprise about all these projects. And remember that these documents that PCIJ got refer to releases in 2023 and 2024. Dubious infra projects have been going on for quite some time now, and it’s impossible for Marcos to know nothing about these anomalies. Either he’s terribly corrupt for allowing all these pork projects (no surprises there) or he’s terribly stupid for not knowing anything about them (an unlikely scenario). Very clearly, unprogrammed funds have emerged as the new receptacle for pork allocations. Despite this, authorities continue to claim that they’re innocuous. On October 29, in a recent forum in Clark, Undersecretary Goddes Libiran of the DBM spewed disinformation during the question and answer portion. To her mild surprise, someone in the audience asked, “Is it true that unprogrammed funds are pork barrel? What are UAs (unprogrammed appropriations)? How is it released?” She replied that for unprogrammed funds to be qualified as pork, it should be a huge lump-sum fund that could be spent on yet unidentified projects. But UA is not like that, Libiran said. This is false. UA is precisely a lump-sum fund. If you check in the General Appropriations Act, for a number of years there’s a line item called “Support for Infrastructure Projects and Social Programs” (later called SAGIP or “Strengthening Assistance for Government Infrastructure and Social Programs”) that do not specify at all what projects will be spent on. For the 2026 budget, this is exactly what Congress modified, to stop the abuse of unprogrammed funds in the past. Specifically, under the leadership of Rep. Suansing, they removed “I” or infrastructure, so SAGIP is now just “Strengthening Assistance for Government Social Programs” or SAGP. This is an acknowledgement that unprogrammed funds had been abused in the past as a lump-sum fund for corruptible public works. The PCIJ documents prove this. Undersecretary Libiran added that the release of UA is very strict (but also said in the same breath, it’s “very lenient”). UA is supposedly not a discretionary fund of DBM, because agencies like the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) are the ones who request and justify the release. So as long as the documents are complete, including a certification from the Treasury that there are excess funds, Libiran said they must release the funds (otherwise the Commission on Audit will go after them). But this points to a missing piece of the puzzle: where are the certifications coming from the Treasury that excess funds do exist? The DBM needs these documents to release money for unprogrammed appropriations. But it’s highly doubtful that there exist excess revenues to justify the release of hundreds of billions of pesos for unprogrammed funds. Also, just because the DPWH requests the release of unprogrammed funds doesn’t mean that DBM has no discretion at all in the release of funds. In fact, they have too much discretion. The budget law itself states that “prioritization of funding of the purposes under the UA” should follow a priority list, and infrastructure projects are low on that list (following personnel benefits, social services, government counterpart of foreign-assisted projects). But in the next provision there’s a loophole: “the order of priority may be modified to support the funding of urgent or implementation-ready projects,” including “the 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda.” This, I realize, is the loophole that DBM can use to justify release of UA for public works (as confirmed by the documents PCIJ gathered). Near the end of the provisions for unprogrammed funds, it also states that, “The DBM is hereby authorized to approve the… modification of amounts within the authorized purposes” and “use of amounts under Purposes of the UA, except the Budgetary Support to GOCCs (Government-Owned and -Controlled Corporations) and the Support to Foreign-Assisted Projects.” In other words, the DBM has wide latitude on how unprogrammed funds will be prioritized and released. What this all suggests is that there’s more to the DBM-DPWH relationship than meets the eye. I hope this gets revealed in the hearings of the Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI), but frankly I’m not hoping that their investigations will amount to much. On Facebook, I called out the “fake news” that Undersecretary Libiran was saying in the Clark event. She replied lengthily, including: “Supreme Court na nga nagsabi na constitutional and legal ang UA, and it is different from pork barrel, pinipilit mo pa rin?” (No less than the Supreme Court has said that UA is constitutional and legal, and it is different from pork barrel, and you’re still insisting otherwise?) The thing is, the Supreme Court has yet to try and decide on a case alleging that unprogrammed funds are unconstitutional. The rebuttal itself includes fake news! At any rate, unprogrammed funds have indeed evolved as the newest iteration of pork: bloated lump-sum funds that allow for post-enactment discretionary spending by the DBM and other agencies, at the behest of politicians. If that’s not pork, I don’t know what is. Sadly, the House version of the 2026 budget promises to include at least P243 billion in unprogrammed funds. The Senate vows to remove this, but let’s see how far they can go about it. I expect budget deliberations to be railroaded up until December, with pork allocations safe and sound.

"MANILA, Philippines – The Lopez family’s property firm Rockwell Land Corporation (Rockwell Land) bought a nearly 75% stake in Alabang Town Center from the Madrigal family for P21.6 billion. In a disclosure late Monday, December 22, Rockwell Land said it had acquired 75% of Alabang Commercial Corporation (ACC), the company that owns Alabang Town Center, from the Madrigals led by real estate developer Francisco Madrigal Bayot, a grandson of former senator and industrialist Vicente Madrigal. “Earlier this year, Mr. Francisco ‘Jun’ M. Bayot invited us to consider redeveloping Alabang Town Center. It presented a compelling opportunity for Rockwell Land to further expand our presence in the south of Metro Manila, particularly given the scale and long-term potential of the property,” Rockwell Land chairman and CEO Nestor Padilla said in a press release on Monday. “We are very grateful to Mr. Bayot and the Madrigal family for this opportunity. Our immediate focus is on ensuring a smooth transition and planning its redevelopment,” he added. Other shareholders of ACC who were part of the share purchase agreement are: Rockwell Land will pay ACC P21.6 billion in three equal installments every December over the next three years. The purchase was announced six days after Ayala Land Incorporated disclosed that it had sold its 50% ownership of Alabang Commercial Center to the Madrigal family for P13.5 billion. The 17.5-hectare Alabang Town Center is a pioneer mall in Muntinlupa City that was developed by the Ayala Group under a joint venture with the Madrigal family. It currently has around 500 retail and office tenants. The purchase gives Rockwell Land the “opportunity to expand its footprint in a prime location with long-term redevelopment opportunities,” the company said. It adds 137,000 square meters of gross leasable area to Rockwell’s existing retail and office portfolio. Rockwell’s most famous project that symbolizes its target premium market is Rockwell Center Makati, home to some of the big names in Philippine business. Its Power Plant Mall is considered a premium retail and lifestyle destination, which is being replicated in other cities. A post shared by Power Plant Mall (@powerplantmall) “Over the years, the company has enhanced its retail developments by integrating experiential and lifestyle-oriented spaces into its masterplanning, supported by curated tenant mixes. These efforts have enabled Rockwell Land to establish a strong track record in delivering a high-end retail experience,” Rockwell Land said. The company also said that the purchase builds on Rockwell’s other retail expansion projects such as the Power Plant Nepo in Angeles City Pampanga; new retail spaces within Rockwell at IPI Center in Cebu City; and the Power Plant Mall Bacolod in Rockwell Center Bacolod. Rockwell’s main business is residential development of high-rise condominiums that cater to high-end buyers. Federico “Piki” Lopez has been vice-chairman of Rockwell Land since 2012. He is chairman and CEO of Lopez firms First Philippine Holdings, First Gen Corporation, and Energy Development Corporation. Last February, debt-saddled Lopez media and entertainment firm ABS-CBN Corporation sold 30,000 square meters of its 44,027-sqm-property in Sgt. Esguerra, Quezon City, to Ayala Land for P6.2 billion, allowing it to pay its outstanding bank loans. – Rappler.com",True,true,Lopez family’s Rockwell buys Alabang Town Center from Madrigals for P21.6 billion,https://www.rappler.com/business/rockwell-land-buys-alabang-town-center-madrigal-family/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Do a regular Google search on AI technologies and their environmental impact. To say the least, the results are worrisome. Now, do a similar query on ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or other chatbots. You would have gotten a similar set of answers — only this time, you’ve used at least five times more power than a regular search. In June, a United Nations report found that four Big Tech firms (Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta) saw their indirect carbon emissions rise by 150% from 2020 to 2023 as their AI operations expanded. To expand, that meant building more data centers — physical facilities housing computers and servers that store, process, and transmit data. Data centers are set to increase, not decrease, in the coming years. The International Energy Agency, in an April 2025 report, estimated that “electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double” by 2030, with AI being identified as the most significant driver. And in the United States, where new data centers are aggressively being built, communities are already being impacted: water supply is disrupted, and electricity costs grow as new data centers rise. In the Philippines, there is a growing push for the country to build more data centers, as the government pursues its digital transformation goals. We are for digital transformation, but given how we’ve seen the power-hungry nature of data centers, it’s important that before the supposed data center “boom” comes, sustainability and the effect on communities are given the most serious consideration right away. Already, our climate targets are a mess, and the building of these data centers — left to their own devices — may just become more part of the problem than a solution to progress. Currently, there are 35 data centers in the Philippines, according to datacentermap.com. And here is an important fact that compounds what could be a big problem if we build data centers without due considerations: it’s hot in the Philippines. A Rest of World (RoW) report in November 2025 found that the Philippines is among the 21 countries that operate data centers in some regions where the average annual temperature is above 27°C. The optimal range is from 18°C to 27°C. The RoW report highlights Singapore — Southeast Asia’s “digital core” where 72 data centers are located — and quotes PS Lee who leads the Sustainable Tropical Data Center Testbed: “In thermal terms, Singapore is almost ‘permanent peak summer’ for a data center…. Cooling is both technically harder and structurally more energy-intensive here than in most other data center hubs.” It’s a challenge that Singapore, through the academia and private firms, is now currently trying to solve, with the government having already mandated reduced water and energy consumption for data centers, RoW said. Lee, noting that other countries also have a similar climate profile, hopes that advances by the Testbed may be adopted as well by others in the future. “Many of the world’s fastest-growing digital economies — such as Jakarta, Manila, Ho Chi Minh City, and Mumbai — share similar hot and humid conditions,” Lee said. BusinessWorld reported in October that Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary Henry Aguda is looking to reach 1.5 gigawatts in total data center output by 2028. Currently, the country’s output is at around 200 megawatts. Regional leader Singapore has a capacity of 1.4 gigawatts, followed by Malaysia and Indonesia, both below 1,000 megawatts. Aguda said the DICT wants to promote the Philippines as a data center hub, and plans to round up investments from the US, amid rising global demand. The environmental impact of data centers again made headlines in the US just days ago when its Congress reformed its 1969 National Environmental Policy Act — which pushes for faster permitting for building data centers, at the expense of comprehensive environmental reviews. Days before that, more than 200 environmental groups were protesting, and demanding a halt to new US data centers, citing the aforementioned water shortage and electricity cost issues. In light of all this, how must the Philippines act? We’re a far, far cry from the data center capacity of the US currently rated at more than 53 gigawatts. But we’re also at a tipping point for data center expansion. So before that happens, we ask: what environmental policies do we have in place that would make this expansion — this digital transformation, and these economic efforts to capture demand — sustainable? The UN’s data center sustainability procurement guidelines released back in June are a start. Aside from Singapore, the European Union — via the Energy Efficiency Directive — also started mandating in 2024 that data centers above 500 kilowatts report their power use with very specific metrics. And green efforts will be a smart business decision too. As the ASEAN Briefing notes: “Environmental sustainability is another critical issue [in attracting data center investments]. ESG-compliant (Environmental, Social, and Governance) designs, energy-efficient cooling systems, and integration with renewable energy sources are becoming baseline requirements from international clients and enterprise customers. Developers who fail to meet these expectations may struggle to attract long-term tenants.” But we also know that in the Philippines, environmental concerns can often play fourth or fifth fiddle to profit, “growth,” or personal gain. We know these data centers are coming, so it’s key that we keep a close eye on communities that may be affected when they are constructed — considering too that electricity and water supply continue to be nagging problems in some regions in the country. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Tech Thoughts] Environmental concerns amid rising data center demand in ‘too hot’ PH,https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/data-centers-philippines-rising-demand-impact-environment/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) formalized an agreement to promote fair competition in public procurement and infrastructure development. DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon and PCC Chair Michael Aguinaldo signed a memorandum of agreement on Thursday, October 23. The agreement formalizes DPWH and PCC cooperation in detecting and addressing anti-competitive behavior in public works projects such as the rigging of bids. The partnership between the DPWH and the country’s anti-trust watchdog comes amid ongoing investigations into alleged corruption plaguing public works projects. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. earlier flagged that just 15 contractors bagged 20% of all flood control projects nationwide. Those found guilty of engaging in anti-competitive agreements such as bid-rigging may face fines of up to P110 million for the first offense, P110 million to P275 million for the second offense, and up to P275 million for the third and succeeding offenses. The two agencies also committed to proactively monitor market conduct and collaborate on a review of DPWH’s policies to ensure they align with the Philippines’ anti-trust law. The agreement also enables the formation of joint task forces for investigations. Dizon described the agreement as part of reforms to cleanse the ranks of the DPWH and return the stolen funds to the government. Aguinaldo also said that one way the funds can be returned is through the imposition of fines for anti-competitive behavior. “It can reach so many hundreds of billions, possibly if we’re able to show for each case that there’s a violation, if you add them all up, it can reach that much. So, indirectly it’s a way of getting the money back,” he said. The PCC chief, however, clarified that this is different from the Ombudsman and Solicitor General’s attempts to recover the funds. – Rappler.com",True,true,DPWH teams up with PCC to promote fair competition in public works projects,https://www.rappler.com/business/dpwh-pcc-partnership-fair-competition-public-works-projects/,Rappler

"MANILA, Philippines – Inflation quickened to 1.8% in December 2025 as strong holiday demand pushed up prices of major food items, the Philippine Statistics Authority reported on Tuesday, January 6. This brings the average inflation rate for 2025 to 1.7%, below the government’s target range of 2% to 4%. According to National Statistician Dennis Mapa, food prices rose at a faster pace in December amid the holiday demand. Recent tropical cyclones also disrupted agricultural production, which led to higher food prices. “Kung naalala ‘nyo, ‘yung buwan ng Nobyembre, may malalakas tayo na bagyo. And this most probably impacted also ‘yung mga vegetable farms natin kaya tumaas ‘yung presyo, particularly sa labas ng National Capital Region,” he explained. (If you recall, we were hit by strong tropical cyclones in November. And this most probably also impacted our vegetable farms, hence the higher prices particularly outside the National Capital Region.) Rice deflation was at -12.3% in December from -15.4% in November, which means prices are now beginning to drop at a slower pace. Prices of vegetables such as eggplant (29.4%), okra (28%), and string beans (24%) notably saw double-digit inflation. Onions and shallots were also among the top contributors to December’s inflation figure, with a 79% inflation rate from 48.2% in November. In Metro Manila, inflation eased to 2.3% from November’s 2.8% due to a slower rise in power rates. Meanwhile, inflation for areas outside the capital region accelerated to 1.7% from the previous month’s 1.2% due to higher food prices. The Central Visayas region continued to record the fastest inflation rate at 3.8%, while the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao continued to log deflation at -1%. Deflation or a negative inflation rate means the general level of prices is going down. Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said the latest inflation print reflected a “proactive and well-coordinated” approach to stabilizing prices and safeguarding Filipinos’ purchasing power. “Building on this momentum, the government will continue to pursue prudent fiscal and monetary coordination and advance structural reforms to sustain the downward inflation trend and support inclusive growth in 2026 and beyond,” he said. DEPDev added that the government is committed to keeping inflation within the 2% to 4% target for the remainder of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s term. Balisacan noted that the 2026 national budget includes a P297.1-billion allocation for the agriculture sector, which aims to boost farmer productivity and strengthen food security. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas earlier forecast inflation in December would settle between 1.2% and 2% due to higher food and gasoline prices. – with reports from Arriane dela Cruz/Rappler.com Arriane dela Cruz is a Rappler intern.

"The façade has finally cracked. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has confirmed that the very appraisal underpinning Villar Land’s trillion-peso “profit” wasn’t just inflated — it failed to comply with International Valuation Standards, making it a textbook case of misrepresentation. It not only supports Vantage Point’s exposé branding the trillion profit as a mirage; a factual forensic analysis which the Villar camp tried to disparage. E-Value, the appraiser handpicked to justify the ₱1.34-trillion leap in land value, couldn’t even produce the documents that supposedly supported its assumptions and methodology. In other words, the valuation that turned ₱5.2-billion worth of land into “₱1.34 trillion” wasn’t just unbelievable — it was unsupported, undocumented, and unacceptable by global standards. More than a technical oversight, it is a damning red flag that strikes at the core of corporate honesty, investor protection, and the integrity of the Philippine capital markets. When a valuation firm claims compliance with global standards — but the SEC finds no evidence to back it up — it’s misrepresentation. It casts a dark shadow over every executive and director who relied on that number to trumpet Villar Land’s phony near-₱1-trillion profit. The regulator has drawn blood: the trillion-peso fairy tale wasn’t just aggressive accounting — it was built on a valuation report that doesn’t meet the most basic thresholds of transparency and credibility. For a brief, dizzying moment, Villar Land looked like it had broken the laws of financial gravity. On paper, it was suddenly worth over ₱1.3 trillion, after a land revaluation in Villar City turned a ₱5.2-billion acquisition into a ₱1.34-trillion “asset” almost overnight. That sleight of hand helped produce a nearly ₱1-trillion profit for 2024 — what would have been the largest in Philippine corporate history. The market swallowed the story. Villar Land’s shares last traded at ₱2,296 apiece, valuing the company at around ₱1.48 trillion, more than many long-established conglomerates combined. Then the adults entered the room. Audit giant Punongbayan & Araullo (P&A) refused to sign off on the fantasy valuation. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered Villar Land and its appraiser E-Value Philippines to explain how empty or sparsely developed land in Villar City could justify a 25,000% gain. And when the dust settled, Villar Land quietly agreed to slash that valuation by 99%, bringing the supposed ₱1.34-trillion land haul down to a far more earthly figure. What’s left after the trillion-peso mirage evaporated is now visible in the company’s own audited numbers — numbers that the Villar group can no longer spin away. (READ: From P999-B profit, Villar Land’s 2024 net income flat amid dipping sales) And those numbers are ugly. According to Villar Land’s 2024 audited disclosure: That means: Does it look like a triumphant trillion-peso juggernaut? This is what a strained balance sheet looks like: more assets funded by more debt, but providing less cushion for shareholders. If you strip away the hype and just do the math, roughly 62% of Villar Land’s assets are now funded by liabilities, leaving only about 38% backed by equity — yet, this is the same company that recently tried to sell itself as the most valuable listed property play in the country. The most damning part of Villar Land’s 2024 profile is not even the asset write-down. It’s the sudden collapse in liquidity: A year ago, Villar Land had more than three pesos in current assets for every peso of short-term liabilities. Now, it’s down to ₱1.46. Strip out inventory and prepayments, and the cushion almost disappears: the quick ratio is barely above 1.0. In plain language: Short-term obligations have ballooned. The buffer to meet them has almost vanished. Now overlay that with what’s happening outside the balance sheet: A company whose short-term liquidity is visibly eroding cannot afford to be on the wrong side of both its regulators and its investors. And yet, this is what Villar Land’s situation is: tighter cash, heavier scrutiny. On paper, Villar Land can still claim to be profitable: And yet the profitability ratios miraculously improved: How do you get higher margins out of falling revenues and stagnant profits? Look at what’s happening below the operating line: In other words, core business is weakening, but the bottom line is being propped up by non-operating gains — the same part of the financial statements where that now-infamous ₱1.33-trillion fair value “gain” once sat. After you’ve seen one of the most aggressive revaluation attempts in Philippine corporate history, you’d be reckless not to question the quality of every peso that comes from “non-operating” sources. The retained earnings ledger tells an equally troubling story. Do the reconciliation, and you’ll find Villar Land effectively paid out around ₱1.9B in dividends or equity adjustments — more than it earned in 2024 — at a time when: When a company under a valuation scandal is still prioritizing cash distributions over balance-sheet repair, the question practically writes itself: Is the listed firm being used as a cash machine for its controllers while ordinary investors are left holding the suspension risk and regulatory fallout? The valuation gap: 1,000× P/E, 100× P/B, and a shattered narrative. At its last traded price of ₱2,296, Villar Land carried metrics that would be laughable if they weren’t so dangerous: That implies: These are certainly not “premium” valuations. They look more like detached-from-reality valuations, built on the back of a trillion-peso land story that no longer exists in the audited books. Yet as of the last trading day before suspension, the market still priced Villar Land as if that story were true. After a six-month suspension for failing to file audited reports, Villar Land finally returned to the trading floor on November 13, 2025. The market’s reaction should have been a referendum on corporate honesty. Instead, the reopening exposed something far more dangerous: the collapse of price discovery in the Philippine stock market. There are two versions reported by the media Version 1 — The crash The stock plunged 30% on its first day back, falling from ₱2,296 to ₱1,608, Wiping out roughly ₱450 billion in market value. Yet unbelievably — even after a 30% collapse, Villar Land still had a market cap of more than ₱1 trillion. A trillion-peso valuation for a company with ₱1.42B in earnings and ₱21 book value per share. Isn’t it delusion? Version 2 — The “nothing happened” scenario This version paints the opposite picture: that Villar Land didn’t fall at all — it even gained 0.17% to ₱2,300, restoring its pre-suspension market cap of ₱1.5 trillion. A company stripped of its trillion-peso accounting trick somehow came back trading as if nothing had happened. Which is correct? Both — and that’s the problem. Whether it’s ₱1,608 or ₱2,300, both outcomes expose the same hard truth: Villar Land remains valued like a fantasy stock — not a real business. Either the market fell for the hype again, or the stock is so illiquid and insider-dominated that real price discovery is impossible. Either way, it is catastrophic for investor protection. A valuation still over ₱1 trillion — even after the scandal — underscores how fragile and distorted our capital markets have become: …yet still trades at: 1,000× earnings, over 100× book value, higher than Ayala Land and SM Prime combined. If this doesn’t alarm investors, regulators, and policymakers, nothing will. This is not just a problem for Villar Land shareholders. It’s an indictment of a broader ecosystem — from brokers and analysts who cheered the rise, to regulators who moved late, to media players who repeated the trillion-peso headline without interrogating how an “empty or sparsely developed” patch of land could suddenly rival major global properties in value. To be fair, the SEC has now begun to bare its teeth. Look again at the 2024 ratios: Villar Land’s greatest vulnerability today is no longer its leverage or its liquidity — serious as those are. Its greatest vulnerability is trust: This is not just about one billionaire or one property firm. When a listed company can: It sends a chilling message: In the Philippines, paper wealth can still be conjured, traded, and celebrated long before anyone asks if it’s real. If pension funds, banks, and ordinary investors are exposed to that kind of “wealth,” they deserve to know exactly what they’re buying. They deserve a regulator that moves swiftly, an exchange that demands answers, and auditors who are empowered — and protected — when they say “no.” The Villar Land numbers you see now — shrinking revenues, collapsing liquidity, swollen liabilities, and cash payouts that exceed earnings — are not just a financial snapshot. They are evidence of how far the story was allowed to go before anyone hit the brakes. And until the market, the regulators, and the political establishment are willing to confront that uncomfortable truth, the real scandal won’t be the trillion pesos that disappeared. It will be the credibility that goes with it. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] Villar Land’s paper empire unravels,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-analysis-villar-land-earnings-2024/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – E-wallet use among sari-sari (general merchandise) stores surged by 75% this year, signaling a digital shift among neighborhood retailers, according to a new report by Filipino tech startup Packworks. Based on transaction data and a survey of over 2,000 store owners within its 300,000-strong network, half reported a 75% increase in e-wallet usage between January and August 2025. Another 20% saw usage double, 20% of those surveyed noted a 50% rise, and 10% reported a 10% uptick. Packworks is a business-to-business firm for micro-retailers with services for helping stores with business inventory and bookkeeping, among others. Store owners attributed the growth to stronger consumer demand for cashless transactions. Around 40% of stores use e-wallets for in-store payments, 30% for bill payments, and 30% for cash-in and cash-out transactions. GCash dominates usage with 85%, followed by Maya at 15%. To handle demand, some stores maintain up to five e-wallet accounts with a combined capacity of up to P3.5 million per month. About 30% plan to upgrade to business accounts for higher transaction limits. This digital shift is quickly becoming a critical source of revenue. Around 13% of store owners say their e-wallet earnings equal their revenue from physical goods. “Bukod sa kita namin sa tindahan, nagkaroon kami ng dagdag kita sa paggamit sa mga e-wallet kasi meron kaming tubo na P10 hanggang P20 sa pag-cash-in at cash-out, o di kaya tuwing nagbabayad ng kuryente, tubig, o internet ang mga customer,” said Rachel Miguel, a store owner from Bacolod. (Besides the income we earn from the store, we also get extra earnings from using e-wallets because we earn a profit of P10 to P20 from cash-in and cash-out transactions, or whenever customers pay for electricity, water, or internet bills.) Among the rest of the respondents, e-wallets still contribute significantly: 66% say that around 20% of their revenues come from e-wallet use, and the remaining 21% say their e-wallet earnings account for 10% of their total revenue. GCash and Maya are the widely used e-wallets, with 85% of store owners reporting using GCash for their business transactions and 15% using Maya. Packworks chief platform officer Hubert Yap said the trend shows sari-sari stores evolving into digital and financial hubs. “Aside from simply selling ‘tingi‘ (small quantity) physical items , they are now diversifying their product range, offering high-margin, value-added financial services and integrating digital tools such as our app to fundamentally improve their operations and function as near-frictionless nano-banks for the neighborhoods they serve,” he said. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas reported that 57% of total retail transactions were cashless in 2024, underscoring the rise of digital payments nationwide. – Rappler.com",True,true,E-wallet use jumps 75% in sari-sari stores – survey,https://www.rappler.com/technology/e-wallet-use-jumps-sari-sari-stores-survey-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Six business groups and trade unions, often at odds on gut issues, issued a common stand on the Marcos administration’s anti-corruption drive, urging the government to take bold and concrete steps to curb corruption. In an open letter to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the groups lamented the lack of criminal charges filed against contractors and public works officials allegedly involved in corruption of flood control and other infrastructure projects. “Instead of going after the most guilty, we are led on political detours, chasing the less guilty, depending on who sits where and who stands with whom,” they wrote. The open letter was signed by the Employers Confederation of the Philippines, Federation of Free Workers, Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Philippine Exporters Confederation Incorporated, Sentro ng mga Nagkakaisa at Progresibong Manggagawa, and the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines. This is the latest open letter calling for Marcos’ urgent action on the Philippines’ worst corruption scandal. Other business groups have also called for urgency in anti-corruption reform, and voiced support for actions that may curb corruption and money laundering. The groups further said that Filipino workers and entrepreneurs have carried the burden of sustaining the country through hard work and tax payments. However, taxes that they have religiously paid to the government never translated into much-needed infrastructure. “People’s money to build classrooms that were never constructed, health centers that never opened, farm-to-market roads that were never paved, and flood control projects that were never built or never worked,” they said. The undersigned groups challenged Marcos to prove that his anti-corruption drive is not just a matter of selective justice. They recommended the following action steps: The Marcos administration has already responded positively to a few of these recommendations, and Congress vowed to open the bicameral conference committee hearings on the budget to the public. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Business, workers’ groups lament slow progress in anti-corruption drive",https://www.rappler.com/business/groups-lament-slow-progress-anti-corruption-drive/,Rappler

"The United States and China on Tuesday, October 14, began charging additional port fees on ocean shipping firms that move everything from holiday toys to crude oil, making the high seas a key front in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. China said it had started to collect the special charges on US-owned, operated, built, or flagged vessels but clarified that Chinese-built ships would be exempted from the levies. In details published by state broadcaster CCTV, China spelled out specific provisions on exemptions, which also include empty ships entering Chinese shipyards for repair. The China-imposed extra port fees would be collected at the first port of entry on a single voyage or for the first five voyages within a year, following an annual billing cycle beginning on April 17. Early this year, US President Donald Trump’s administration announced plans to levy the fees on China-linked ships to loosen the country’s grip on the global maritime industry and bolster US shipbuilding. An investigation during former president Joe Biden’s administration concluded China uses unfair policies and practices to dominate the global maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors, clearing the way for those penalties. China hit back last week, saying it would impose its own port fees on US-linked vessels from the same day the US fees took effect. Analysts expect China-owned container carrier COSCO to be most affected, shouldering nearly half of that segment’s expected $3.2 billion cost from those fees in 2026. In a related move, Beijing also imposed sanctions on Tuesday against five US-linked subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean which it said had “assisted and supported” a US probe into Chinese trade practices. Hanwha said it is aware of the announcement and is closely monitoring the potential business impact, and that it will continue to provide services to its customers, “including through our investments in the US maritime industry and via Hanwha Philly Shipyard.” Hanwha Ocean’s shares sank nearly 6%. China also launched an investigation into how the US probe affected its shipping and shipbuilding industries. “This tit-for-tat symmetry locks both economies into a spiral of maritime taxation that risks distorting global freight flows,” Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers Incorporated said in a research note. A Shanghai-based consultant who advises global companies on trade with China said the new fees may not be very disruptive to the industry and any rising costs probably would be captured in higher prices. “What are we going to do? Stop shipping? Trade is already pretty disrupted with the US, but companies are finding a way,” the consultant said, asking to remain anonymous as he was not authorized to speak with the media. The US announced last Friday a carve-out for long-term charterers of China-operated vessels carrying US ethane and LPG, deferring the port fees for them through December 10. But ship-tracking company Vortexa identified 45 LPG-carrying VLGCs — 11% of the total fleet — that would still be subject to China’s port fee, its Americas analyst Samantha Hartke said. Clarksons Research said in a report that the new port fees could affect oil-tankers accounting for 15% of global capacity. Jefferies analyst Omar Nokta estimated that 13% of crude tankers and 11% of container ships in the global fleet would be affected. In a reprisal against China curbing exports of critical minerals, Trump on Friday threatened to slap additional 100% tariffs on goods from China and put new export controls on “any and all critical software” by November 1. Administration officials hours later warned that countries voting in favor of a plan by the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from ocean shipping this week could face sanctions, port bans, or punitive vessel charges. China has publicly supported the IMO plan. “The weaponisation of both trade and environmental policy signals that shipping has moved from being a neutral conduit of global commerce to a direct instrument of statecraft,” Xclusiv said. Shares in Shanghai-listed COSCO rose more than 2% in early trading on Tuesday. The company said its board had approved a plan to buy back up to 1.5 billion yuan ($210.3 million) worth of its shares within the next three months to maintain corporate value and safeguard shareholder interest. The shipping firm did not immediately respond to Reuters’ queries about the port fees. – Rappler.com ($1 = 7.1337 Chinese yuan)",True,true,"US, China roll out tit-for-tat port fees, threatening more turmoil at sea",https://www.rappler.com/business/usa-china-port-fees-october-14-2025/,Rappler
"Microsoft and OpenAI announced a restructuring deal on Tuesday, October 28, that frees the ChatGPT maker to move away from its nonprofit roots and likely go public so it can finance CEO Sam Altman’s ambitious plans to develop data centers and cutting-edge technology. The deal refashions the $500 billion company as a public benefit corporation that is controlled by a nonprofit with a stake in OpenAI’s financial success. In a livestream broadcast, Altman said an initial public offering was the most likely path for the company’s future, given how much money is needed to train and build AI systems like the one that supports ChatGPT. Altman and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki opened the livestream by outlining plans to shift OpenAI from a product company into a platform that lets others build their own tools, services, and businesses on top of its technology. “We can now take this technology and this user base and this sort of framework we’ve built and get the whole world to build amazing new companies and services and applications on top of it,” Altman said. The restructuring has been one of many initiatives under way at OpenAI, which is betting that its generative AI technology will ultimately transform the global economy. The moves have heartened OpenAI’s investors and business partners, including Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, who was asked about the news at a developer conference on Tuesday. “I wish back in the earlier days that we had invested a lot more,” Huang said. “If you told me that OpenAI is going to go public next year, I’m not surprised, and in a lot of ways, I think this can be one of the most successful public offerings in history.” Tuesday’s agreement removes major constraints on OpenAI’s ability to raise capital and secure computing resources from Microsoft that have been in place since the two companies forged their agreement in 2019. Once AI assistant ChatGPT exploded in popularity three years ago, those limitations sparked tensions between the firms. The discussions to restructure OpenAI started after Altman was pushed out of OpenAI temporarily. The episode in late 2023 highlighted how the startup’s unusual structure limited the power of its investors and business partners, including Microsoft. Altman will not get equity in the restructured company, an OpenAI spokesperson said, in a reversal from discussions last year that would have given him a stake. The spokesperson added there will be no changes to his compensation from OpenAI, which pays him some $76,000 a year. Altman said OpenAI has financial obligations of $1.4 trillion to help build roughly 30 gigawatts of data-center infrastructure over the next few years. Eventually, OpenAI would like to build a data center that can produce one new gigawatt of power per week, Altman said, without offering more details. Each gigawatt costs as much as $50 billion to build, and Altman said he would like to help bring the cost down to $20 billion. The new OpenAI Group PBC will function more like a traditional company, cementing Altman’s power and giving him more leeway to strike deals, raise money and shape the broader AI industry. Microsoft will not have rights to any consumer hardware produced by OpenAI, and no longer has the right of first refusal to be OpenAI’s compute provider. Even so, Microsoft will hold a 27% stake in OpenAI and remain a significant player in its future. OpenAI will continue to share about 20% of its revenue with Microsoft for years to come, people familiar with the matter said. Microsoft’s previous 2019 agreement had many provisions that rested on when OpenAI reached artificial general intelligence, and the new deal requires an independent panel to verify OpenAI’s claims that it has reached AGI, the point at which AI systems can match a well-educated human adult. Microsoft will still hold a stake of about $135 billion in OpenAI Group PBC, which will be controlled by the nonprofit OpenAI Foundation, the companies said. The Redmond, Washington-based firm has invested $13.8 billion in OpenAI, with Tuesday’s deal implying that Microsoft had generated a return of nearly 10 times its investment. Microsoft shares rose 2%, sending its market value above $4 trillion again. The deal keeps the two firms intertwined until at least 2032, with a massive cloud computing contract and with Microsoft retaining some rights to OpenAI products and AI models until then, even if OpenAI reaches AGI. OpenAI and Microsoft expect to end the revenue-share agreement once an independent panel declares AGI, but OpenAI can also make those payments later. Both companies declined to say when they expect those commitments to end. With some 800 million weekly users as of October, ChatGPT has exploded in popularity to become the face of AI for many consumers after OpenAI’s founding as a nonprofit AI safety group. As the company grew, the Microsoft deal constrained OpenAI’s ability to raise funds from outside investors and secure computing contracts as the crush of ChatGPT users and its research into new models caused its computing needs to skyrocket. The requirement that OpenAI exclusively rely on Microsoft for computational resources was among the largest sources of tension. “OpenAI has completed its recapitalization, simplifying its corporate structure,” Bret Taylor, the OpenAI Foundation’s board chair, said in a blog post. “The nonprofit remains in control of the for-profit, and now has a direct path to major resources before AGI arrives.” Taylor and other board members — including Altman — have the power to appoint and remove members of the PBC’s board. The OpenAI Foundation has a 26% stake in OpenAI Group and a warrant to receive additional shares if the company hits certain milestones. “OpenAI still faces ongoing scrutiny around transparency, data usage, and safety oversight. But overall, this structure should provide a clearer path forward for innovation and accountability,” said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments. Microsoft also said that it has secured a deal with OpenAI where the ChatGPT maker will purchase $250 billion of Azure cloud computing services. In exchange, Microsoft will no longer have the right of first refusal to provide computing services to OpenAI. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Microsoft, OpenAI reach deal removing fundraising constraints for ChatGPT maker",https://www.rappler.com/technology/microsoft-openai-deal-for-profit-company-october-2025/,Rappler
"BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – The Mile Hi Group has asked Malacañang to review the procedures that led to the closure of its outlets inside Camp John Hay, saying the enforcement of Cease and Desist Orders (CDOs) on November 3, 2025 left “no prior notice or opportunity to cure any alleged deficiencies,” based on its official statement dated November 28. The group said its appeal is anchored on “documented timelines and official communications” it previously submitted to authorities. A September 5, 2025 letter from JHMC president and CEO Manjit T. Singh Reandi confirmed that Mile Hi’s leases at the Mile Hi Complex were extended “until January 5, 2026,” while expansion proposals remained under review. This followed an August 28 letter from proponent Luigi Nuñez requesting continued collaboration and lease extension. This written extension stands in contrast to later public statements that the tenants were operating without a subsisting lease. In its statement, the Mile Hi Group said it had invested in bringing activity back to long-unused portions of the Mile Hi Complex under the June–August 2025 lease, subsequently extended by JHMC. It added that it raised billing and utility questions in letters sent on September 6, September 24, and October 28 — among them a water charge exceeding ₱182,000 for three months, far higher than the reported averages of other outlets. Despite these unresolved issues, the group said it delivered checks on November 14 “to cover the full amount of the outstanding billing,” but JHMC staff did not accept the payment due to internal approval procedures. According to the Mile Hi Group, the CDOs were dated October 30 and served on November 3, about an hour after one of the owners visited the JHMC office to discuss billing concerns. The orders were implemented immediately, halting operations at all outlets. It also noted that Final Demand and Notice to Vacate letters, typically issued before closures, were dated November 17 and served on November 18, more than two weeks after the shutdown. The group said the sequence was included in its statement “solely to complete the factual timeline.” A separate November 6 letter from JHMC building official Engineer Bobby Akia revoked the Authority to Operate for In-Bento, Hay&Co, and Mile Hi Diner. The letter cited expired lease agreements, continued operations after their lapse, accumulated lease and Common Use Service Area (CUSA) obligations, utility arrears, and items listed in an October 23 Notice of Violation. It also said the Office of the Building Official (OBO) would recommend cancellation of the outlets’ business permits by the Baguio City Government. The group said more than 30 employees have been unable to work since the closures and estimated losses at around ₱3.8 million from non-operations, cancelled bookings, and spoilage. On November 25, Nuñez submitted an administrative complaint to the Office of the Deputy Executive Secretary for Legal Affairs, accusing Reandi of abuse of authority, oppression, retaliation, harassment, gross violation of due process, defiance of the BCDA Board, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. Nuñez wrote that the complaint stemmed from the “simultaneous Cease-and-Desist Orders issued without due process on November 3, 2025” and affirmed that its contents were based on his personal knowledge and official records. Reandi, in an interview with the media on December 5, Friday, said JHMC acted within normal procedures and stressed that the tenants’ contract had ended. He said the outlets were allowed to operate temporarily “under the tolerance of the management” to support economic activity but maintained that collection efforts must be fair to other tenants who pay regularly. He added that JHMC had documentation of attempts to reach the locators and said that when obligations are “due and demandable,” agencies cannot override Commission on Audit (COA) rules. He also said tenants issued CDOs for non-payment should approach the imposing agency for guidance. “Ayaw din naman namin na magsarado, kaso gusto namin fair,” Reandi said. (We also don’t want them to close, but we want fairness.) In its statement, the Mile Hi Group said it respects “all lawful processes” and is seeking clarification to ensure it is given a fair chance to comply. It emphasized that its release “is not intended to make allegations of wrongdoing,” but to inform stakeholders of its status and request for review.

"MANILA, Philippines – Detained mining tycoon Joseph Sy, who is facing deportation charges for supposedly falsifying his Filipino citizenship, has resigned as director of nickel exporting firm Global Ferronickel Holdings Incorporated (FNI), effective immediately, the company disclosed on Friday, December 26. “His decision was due to personal considerations and for the best interests of the company. The company expresses its appreciation for Mr. Sy’s service and contributions during his tenure,” publicly listed FNI told the Philippine Stock Exchange. The Bureau of Immigration said Sy has the same fingerprints as Chinese citizen Chen Zhong Zhen. He was arrested at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport on August 21 for allegedly misrepresenting himself as a Filipino citizen. He is currently being held at the BI’s detention facility in Taguig City while his case is on appeal. Sy’s resignation was announced 11 days after an embarrassing appearance before the Senate justice and human rights subcommittee chaired by Senator Risa Hontiveros, where he dodged questions about his citizenship due to his pending legal case. When asked by Hontiveros basic questions of where he was born and where he grew up, Sy repeatedly said, “I can invoke my right to remain silent.” “Humarap nga sa Senado ang mining businessman na si Joseph Sy, pero wala namang maayos na sagot! Lumaki din ba siya sa farm? Mining tycoon na nagpapanggap umano na Pilipino? Another Alice Guo na naman ba ito?” Hontiveros said after the hearing, referring to the dismissed mayor of Bamban, Tarlac, who was found guilty by a Pasig City court in November for human trafficking. (Mining businessman Joseph Sy faced the Senate but failed to give good answers. Did he also grow up on a farm? A mining tycoon allegedly pretending to be a Filipino? Is this another Alice Guo?) “Ang tanong ngayon: paano siya naging Pilipino? Bakit may Chinese citizen na may kapareho niyang fingerprints? Was his identity lawfully obtained or manufactured for special access? Hindi na sapat ang palusot. The abuse of our laws and our systems must end.” (The question now is: how did he become a Filipino citizen? Why does he have the same fingerprints as a Chinese citizen? Was his identity lawfully obtained or manufactured for special access? Excuses are not enough. The abuse of our laws and our systems must end.) A Taguig City court and the Court of Appeals had ordered Sy’s release last September, but the BI has kept him under detention while it appeals the ruling of the CA. Sy went on leave as chairman of the board of Global Ferronickel after his arrest. Due to his mining expertise, he has served as director of mining for the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which has issued calls for his immediate release, saying his continued detention sends a bad signal to potential investors. Global Ferronickel is the Philippines’ second biggest nickel ore exporter. Its subsidiary, Platinum Group Metals Corporation or PGMC, is the Philippines’ second largest nickel ore producer, accounting for around 12% of the total value of shipment of the country yearly from 2014 to 2024. It explores and mines for nickel mainly from Surigao del Norte in Mindanao. Sy became president of PGMC in July 2011 or 14 years ago. Global Ferronickel’s primary buyers are trading companies and end-users in China. Its Chinese customers use the nickel ore to produce intermediate products for the manufacture of stainless steel. The Philippines is the second largest nickel ore producer in the world next to Indonesia. – Rappler.com",True,true,Detained mining tycoon Joseph Sy resigns from Global Ferronickel,https://www.rappler.com/business/joseph-sy-resigns-director-mining-firm-global-ferronickel/,Rappler
"In politics, perception is as potent as policy. It’s not only what our public officials do that shapes trust, but also who surrounds them — especially when those relatives occupy sensitive positions in government or agencies dealing with public funds. The optics alone can be corrosive. Take, for instance, Edna Marcoleta, wife of Senator Rodante Marcoleta who sits as an independent director of Stronghold Insurance Company, the company which provided bonds to the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) flood control projects of Pacifico “Curlee” Discaya II and Cezarah Rowena “Sarah” Cruz Discaya. Or 83-year-old Evelyn Escudero, the mother of former Senate president Francis “Chiz” Escudero, who holds a directorial post in the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) — the same institution reportedly connected to Stronghold’s insurance deals. Technically, there’s nothing illegal there. These are appointments within the bounds of corporate and civil-service regulations. Yet public service is not merely about legality — it’s about integrity, propriety, and perception. When a senator’s wife or mother holds a post in an institution tied to government contracts or investment decisions, the public naturally wonders: Is political influence at play? These familial linkages cast a long shadow on transparency. At a time when the flood-control scandal has reignited public anger over political patronage and contractor collusion, such connections invite skepticism. Efforts to rebuild trust through independent probes will falter if these ethical blind spots persist. Power, after all, is not just exercised — it is seen. And when it appears that public office is intertwined with personal advantage, no amount of legalese can wash away the stain of impropriety. Public officials must therefore recognize the limits of perception. A simple surname — “Marcoleta” or “Escudero” — carries weight in the corridors of government. That alone should inspire prudence, not entitlement. Equally, our legislators and public figures must resist the temptation to be onion-skinned when criticized. The press does not exist to flatter power; it exists to test it. Journalists who point out potential conflicts of interest or patterns of influence are not enemies of the state — they are its conscience. Democracy thrives on sunlight, and those who wield authority must learn to live under its glare. When politicians’ families take positions in agencies or companies doing business with government, it may pass the letter of the law, but fails the higher test of public trust. In the end, the question is not whether it’s legal. The question is whether it’s right. And that’s a question every public servant — and their family members — must be ready to answer. GSIS records show Stronghold receiving notices of award, binders, notices to proceed, and lead-market certifications for GSIS’ property/engineering and catastrophe excess-of-loss programs across 2023–2025. Stronghold itself has publicized winning a major GSIS treaty. In short, Stronghold is part of GSIS’ insurance/reinsurance panels. Context that heightens the optics: GSIS is also Nat Re’s largest shareholder, and Mrs. Escudero chairs Nat Re — an entity historically included in GSIS-arranged reinsurance panels. That ownership/control web is legal and long-standing, but it sharpens “perception risk” when a senator’s mother sits on the GSIS board, while another senator’s spouse holds a board seat at a private insurer with GSIS awards. In brief: there is a verifiable institutional connection (GSIS ⇄ Stronghold), and verifiable family roles (Escudero in GSIS/Nat Re; Marcoleta in Stronghold). In the shadow of the ongoing flood-control controversy, the public is scrutinizing bonds, insurers, and reinsurance panels that backstop DPWH projects. When Stronghold appears in those conversations, and GSIS (where Ms. Escudero is a trustee) is awarding or coordinating cover where Stronghold is a participant, perception risk spikes — especially since Mrs. Marcoleta sits on Stronghold’s board. Even if every rule is followed (e.g. conflict-of-interest disclosures and recusals), the surnames alone amplify suspicion. That’s a governance problem of appearance as much as action. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] What’s in a name?

"What stands out immediately in the PrimeWater-Crystal Bridges transaction is not what is disclosed, but what is conspicuously absent. In Philippine capital-market practice, silence can be as revealing as disclosure — and here the buyer’s lack of submitted financial statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is itself a material signal that deserves scrutiny. From a governance and market-integrity perspective, Crystal Bridges’ failure to file any financial statements raises a clear red flag, even if it is technically defensible under a narrow reading of SEC rules. While privately held investment vehicles are not always required to publish audited financials in the same way as publicly listed firms, the moment such an entity acquires control of a regulated infrastructure operator with nationwide concessions, the disclosure bar rises — not legally by default, but practically, reputationally, and regulatorily. Water utilities are quasi-public assets. They sit at the intersection of consumer welfare, long-dated concession contracts, and systemic credit exposure. A buyer stepping into that role without any publicly verifiable financial trail forces regulators, lenders, and consumers to take solvency, funding capacity, and related-party risk largely on trust. The Villar family’s decision to walk away from PrimeWater is being framed as fatigue — too many complaints, too much politics, too little reward. But viewed through the full record, the exit looks less like exhaustion and more like a calculated retreat from a business that became impossible to defend in public, regulatory, and electoral terms. (READ: Voters in hardest-hit PrimeWater service areas decisively reject Camille Villar) PrimeWater did not implode financially. It imploded reputationally. By the time former senator Cynthia Villar told reporters on July 31 that PrimeWater had turned out to be a “bad investment” that “doesn’t earn much” and had become “just being used against us in politics,” the damage had already been done. An estimated six million customers were affected, many of whom were paying on time while experiencing dry taps. READ: [Vantage Point] Taps go dry with expensive, inefficient PrimeWater service A Rappler team had solidly documented that water shortages in San Jose del Monte and other areas were not works of fiction. Also, a Thomson Reuters Foundation report published in August 2023 via Reuters documented residents describing “murky” or unusable water alongside higher bills, plus complaints that fell “on deaf ears,” and it noted Commission on Audit (COA) scrutiny of several PrimeWater-related partnerships. The situation had turned into a ‘daylight nightmare,’ if there is such a word, that became a major campaign-stage issue. President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. had publicly acknowledged the complaints. The Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) had assembled volumes of documentation and openly cited lack of investment as the root cause. (READ: [Local Vote] In vote-rich Calabarzon, PrimeWater makes a killing) In utilities, that is the point of no return. More telling is that PrimeWater’s financial record contradicts the narrative of a money-losing venture, as the Villar family matriarch claimed. Its profits climbed steadily, breaching ₱1 billion as early as 2022. According to its latest financial statement obtained by Vantage Point, the company’s profits rose further by 2024. PrimeWater’s 2024 audited financial statements, signed off by Punongbayan & Araullo with an unqualified opinion, show a company that is capital-intensive but operationally cash-generative. Total assets rose to ₱42.37 billion, liabilities to ₱26.04 billion, and net income to ₱1.35 billion. More importantly, operating cash flows reached ₱6.08 billion, broadly matching the scale of reinvestment needs, with ₱5.85 billion plowed back into infrastructure. This is not cosmetic profitability; it is a utility throwing off real cash, albeit one that must constantly reinvest just to stand still. Yet the PrimeWater statements also reveal why the identity and balance-sheet strength of the buyer matter so much. Service concession assets account for ₱26.1 billion of carrying value — by far the dominant asset class. These are long-dated, amortized over 25 years, and economically viable only if financing remains stable, lenders stay supportive, and regulators retain confidence in the operator’s backers. Any question regarding the ultimate owner’s financial depth becomes a question about the sustainability of the concessions themselves. The accounting policy shift in 2024 — from the revaluation model to the cost model for property and equipment — adds another layer to this story. The retrospective restatement wiped ₱1.3 billion off assets, increased liabilities by ₱321 million, and cut equity by ₱905 million as of 2023. While this move arguably improves conservatism and comparability, it also underscores how sensitive PrimeWater’s balance sheet is to accounting judgments. In such a context, the financial capacity of the controlling shareholder is not a footnote; it is a risk mitigant. If the public will be kept in the dark about Crystal Bridges’ financials, consumers, investors, and regulators alike cannot assess whether the parent company can absorb shocks, inject equity, or refinance debt if assumptions proved optimistic. There are also softer but no less important signals embedded in PrimeWater’s numbers. Advances from related parties remain at ₱3.58 billion, and management fees of ₱350 million continue to flow within the group. Accrued expenses nearly doubled year-on-year. Fully depreciated assets worth ₱947 million are still in use — normal for utilities, but a reminder of capital-replacement risk. These are manageable issues under a transparent, well-capitalized ownership structure. They become more concerning when the new owner’s own financial standing is effectively a black box. Enter Crystal Bridges — and the discomfort deepens. The buyer’s financial silence is not illegal, but it is destabilizing. A holding company acquiring a nationwide water portfolio without publicly filed financial statements asks customers, regulators, and markets to accept a leap of faith precisely when trust is already depleted. This is the worst possible sequencing for a utility transition: service failure first, ownership opacity second. And then there is the baggage — unavoidable, contextual, and impossible to ignore. Lucio Co’s public record is not one of conviction, but it is one of persistent allegation. For more than two decades, across multiple administrations, his name has surfaced in smuggling and tax-related controversies. Former Philippine National Police (PNP) chief and now Senator Panfilo Lacson had spoken openly — if carefully — about long-standing suspicions, always underscoring the same refrain: no arrest without evidence, no warrant without a paper trail. Senate hearings, customs intelligence lists, and media reports repeatedly cited Co, even as cases stalled or collapsed for lack of proof. Courts ultimately ruled in his favor in major tax disputes. No criminal conviction stands as of 2025. That history matters not because it proves wrongdoing — it does not — but because it illustrates a pattern that regulators and markets understand all too well: businesses that operate in gray zones of perception accumulate risk even when they clear legal hurdles. Repeated allegations, even unresolved ones, raise the bar for transparency. They do not lower it. Which is why Crystal Bridges’ invisibility is such a poor fit for a water utility acquisition. PrimeWater is not a supermarket chain or a real-estate holding company. It is a monopoly service provider whose legitimacy rests on three pillars only: service delivery, investment discipline, and trust. The Villar family lost the first two in the public eye. The new owner has yet to establish the third. Put bluntly, this is not about whether Lucio Co is guilty of anything. It is about whether a sector — already bruised by underinvestment and political fallout — can afford an owner whose financial capacity is not publicly verifiable. When millions of households are paying for water that does not reliably arrive, the market does not care about legal technicalities. It cares about accountability. The deeper lesson from PrimeWater is not that privatization has failed. It is that privatization without sustained capital, transparency, and consumer-centric enforcement inevitably collapses under its own contradictions. Utilities cannot be run like political side-businesses or balance-sheet conveniences. They demand patience, visibility, and a tolerance for scrutiny that many conglomerates underestimate. If the Villar family exited because PrimeWater became a liability rather than an asset, the question now shifts to Crystal Bridges: will it confront that liability head-on or merely inherit it quietly? PrimeWater’s rising revenues amid documented service complaints are not, by themselves, a smoking gun. But in a public-utility context, the combination of (1) growing collections, (2) allegations of chronic service failures and ignored complaints, and (3) a change of control into an ownership vehicle whose financials are not publicly visible is enough to justify the sharpest, most pro-consumer regulatory posture. (READ: PrimeWater allegedly not paying contractors, water districts: ‘Dami ’nyong nabudol’) The deal may be legal. The deal may even be strategically sound. But until tap water flows reliably and clearly — and until the new owner stops operating like a ghost — the market should treat the transaction for what it currently looks like to the paying public: a transfer of billing rights, and not a restoration of service. – Rappler.com Click here for more Vantage Point articles.",True,true,[Vantage Point] PrimeWater’s sellout: A ghost buyer and a broken utility,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-primewater-sale-lucio-co-ghost-buyer-broken-utility/,Rappler
"Not many people know that the Philippines’ economic managers come up with a yearly document called the Fiscal Risks Statement. It’s the government’s attempt to tell the public of things that could go wrong with the country’s finances. If you look at the document for 2025, written in 2024, there was no mention at all of corruption. I’m expecting the document for 2026 will at least get to mention that. But it was already apparent among the economic managers (speaking collectively) that there were red flags that could erode the country’s fiscal space. The most striking thing is that they already flagged the ballooning of unprogrammed appropriations. They said, “In the years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the GAA (General Appropriations Act) levels for UAs (Unprogrammed Appropriations) remained unchanged from their National Expenditure Program (NEP) levels. It was only in 2022 and the years thereafter that GAA levels began to deviate from NEP levels…” This is a refreshingly honest take, something you won’t normally hear from the economic managers in press conferences, but totally in line with my own analysis last year. In particular, the economic managers worried that more and more foreign-assisted projects (FAPs) were being dumped into unprogrammed funds. They said that if this continues, it “may lead to a slowdown in the implementation of FAPs and result in higher commitment fees and/or charges, as well as necessarily increase the NG’s (national government) deficit by as much as P181.8 billion…” Also, we should expect more delays: there’s “greater risk to the timely implementation of FAPs (foreign-assisted projects) considering that these usually cover pre-implementation activities. With this, the agency will be forced to restructure their work plans and targets which will result in a prolonged implementation period.” A good example of this is the Metro Manila Subway. When I checked the budget documents starting in 2020, the Metro Manila Subway (Phase 1) has been put in unprogrammed funds every year since the 2021. No wonder it’s delayed: from an initial partial opening in 2027, the Subway will be pushed back to 2032. Another red flag in the Fiscal Risks Statement is the ballooning of pensions for military and uniformed personnel (MUPs). They noted that the government owed in 2023 about P14 trillion in unpaid MUP pensions. That’s nearly thrice the total national budget for that year! The economic managers said, “It must be reiterated that currently, the pension system is fully dependent on government funding, posing not only a substantial risk to the fiscal position of the NG but also to the pension system itself considering that any fiscal and/or economic shock affecting the NG would directly impact the pensions and retirement benefits doled out to MUPs.” (EXPLAINER: How generous military pension is pushing Philippines to fiscal collapse) Recall that the Department of Finance, under former secretary Benjamin Diokno, tried to push for MUP pension reforms. Cielo Magno, my colleague at the UP School of Economics, was at the forefront of this reform before she was let go of by the Marcos administration. But MUP pension reforms stalled when Ralph Recto took over, and God knows whether Frederick Go, the new finance chief, will be bold enough to revisit these much-needed reforms. We can’t just kick the can down the road. Then there’s the age-old problem of underspending, or the government being unable to fully use up the money it’s allowed to spend. The Fiscal Risks Statement explained that the reasons for underspending (or even overspending in some instances) include “the efficiency of agencies in executing their programs and projects, as well as risk events such as weather disturbances, external developments, supply chain disruptions…” The spending ban earlier this year due to the elections was also a factor. The Department of Health (DOH) divulged earlier this budget season that only 200 of the country’s 600 health centers were operational. The reason is that many local government units failed to hire personnel (like nurses and doctors) for these centers. One lawmaker explained, “These are not ghost projects. They exist, but…they are not functioning.” Indeed, underspending happens at both the national and local levels. Unless this is addressed, much funding in the government will either be corrupted (there’s no underspending in corrupt public works, as we know now) or simply returned to the treasury. The Fiscal Risks Statement also highlighted problems with mounting debt. It warned that poorer revenue collections and “weaker-than-expected growth” will put pressure on the government to borrow even more, and this won’t help reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio. There are many reasons to worry about this. As I wrote on November 14, the 4% growth rate in the third quarter of 2025 turned out to be a shocker. Slow growth means that it will be harder to repay our outstanding debt. I expect economic growth to pick up in the fourth quarter (because of the holiday season) but don’t expect it to rescue the entire year’s growth performance. To reach the government’s lower target of 5.5%, we’ll need 7% growth — a moonshot. In conclusion, I wonder what the 2026 version of the Fiscal Risks Statement will say. At any rate, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. could step up reforms to address all these risks to the country’s finances. These days, though, he’s too busy playing politics. One could even say that the President himself, alongside some members of the economic team, are part of the fiscal risks, too, if we’re going to be honest. President Marcos, since he’s the one who signed off on the bloated national budgets and turned a blind eye on the budget shenanigans since 2022. Former finance chief Ralph Recto, since he’s the one who took money from PhilHealth and the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation to fund items in unprogrammed funds. And former budget chief Amenah Pangandaman, since she’s the one who crafted the proposed budget and allowed massive insertions without batting an eyelash. In short, the government has been shooting itself in the foot, but just won’t admit it. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of False Nostalgia: The Marcos “Golden Age” Myths and How to Debunk Them.

"MANILA, Philippines – The Ty family’s GT Capital Holdings Incorporated is teaming up with Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) to build the school’s newest campus in Cavite by 2030. ADMU and GT Capital on Friday, October 24, inked a memorandum of agreement to establish a new ADMU campus in Riverpark, a township development in General Trias City, Cavite owned by GT Capital’s Federal Land. GT Capital’s vice chair Alfred Ty said the Jesuit university’s presence in Riverpark will strengthen Cavite’s educational landscape. “Our investment in this campus reflects our long-term commitment to creating sustainable value for generations of Filipinos, anchored on the values of excellence and service,” he said. ADMU president Roberto Yap said the new campus will allow them to bring Jesuit education closer to learners and families in Cavite and its neighboring provinces. “This expansion reaffirms Ateneo’s enduring commitment to be a force for good — forming persons who are not only competent but also compassionate, ready to lead and serve in a rapidly changing world,” he said. A post shared by Riverpark (@riverparkph) Envisioned as the “next-gen city of the south,” Riverpark is also welcoming other developments such as SM City General Trias and Uniqlo’s logistics facility.

"MANILA, Philippines – A global shortage of memory chips, propelled by surging demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, is expected to push up the average selling prices of personal computers and smartphones in 2026, said research firm IDC. The memory market — which includes DRAM and NAND flash used in everyday devices — is facing an imbalance as production capacity shifts toward AI-oriented components. DRAM is fast-access memory that computers use to run programs and applications. NAND flash is storage memory for saving photos, documents, and all other files. The production for both types is expected to be affected by the growing demand of AI data centers. The IDC explained: “Instead of expanding conventional DRAM and NAND used in smartphones, PCs, and other consumer electronics, major memory makers have shifted production toward memory used in AI data centers, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and high-capacity DDR5. This has restricted the supply of general-purpose memory modules and driven up prices across the board.” Memory manufacturing capacity is being reallocated. Instead of allocating supply of conventional memory used in consumer devices, manufacturers like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron — the world’s three biggest memory makers — have shifted production toward memory modules that serve AI servers and hyperscaler data center infrastructure. “This is a zero-sum game: every wafer allocated to an HBM stack for an Nvidia GPU is a wafer denied to the LPDDR5X (DRAM) module of a mid-range smartphone or the SSD (NAND) of a consumer laptop,” the IDC said. This shift has tightened the availability of DRAM and NAND for smartphones and PCs, driving up component prices. For smartphones, memory often constitutes a significant portion of the bill of materials, especially in mid-range devices. As memory costs rise, smartphone makers may have little choice but to increase prices, cut memory specifications, or both. The IDC’s downside scenarios suggest average smartphone selling prices could rise 3-5% in a moderate case or up to 6-8% in a “pessimistic scenario.” In the PC market, the memory shortage converges with the transition to AI-enhanced PC systems and the end of legacy software support cycles, specifically Windows 10. Major vendors have signaled broad price increases, and under the IDC’s scenarios, average selling prices for PCs could also climb 4–8% in 2026. “The severity and duration of the shortage will be determined by how quickly production capacity can expand and how effectively demand rebalances across segments,” the IDC said. – Rappler.com",True,true,"PC, smartphone prices to rise by up to 8% as AI drives memory shortage — research firm",https://www.rappler.com/technology/pc-smartphone-rising-prices-ai-memory-shortage/,Rappler
"SAN FERNANDO CITY, La Union – Months before October 17, 2025, the opening date of SM City La Union, banners had begun to pepper public spaces across the province. The quantity of announcements — on roadside billboards, building walls, and bus stops — felt almost like an election campaign, except this one came with corporate polish and sizzle. Online, Ilocanos speculated about which brands were coming, and whether the already congested roads of San Fernando, the province’s capital, could handle the traffic. There was unease, but also excitement. When the day came, 51,000 Ilocanos flooded the new mall, surpassing even SM City Laoag’s May 2025 debut by 29%. The crowd kept coming: 41,000 and 51,000 more arrived on Saturday and Sunday. Outside, traffic slowed to a crawl. Inside, the province saw, for the first time, what its own SM looked and felt like, no longer the distant cousin to the malls in Baguio or Pangasinan. Even the skeptics paused to look, not at the mall itself, but at what its arrival meant for the province they thought they already knew. “La Union is very strategic,” said Hans Sy, son of SM founder Henry Sy, who flew in with several family members a day before the opening. “It’s like the junction. It’s in the middle of everything.” SM has previously opened malls in Baguio, Rosales, Tuguegarao, and Laoag — all in northern Luzon. (TRIVIA: What some of the richest Filipinos have in common) That word — junction — has long defined the province. At the foot of Baguio to the east, La Union sits midway along the corridor linking Pangasinan, Ilocos Sur, and Ilocos Norte. Its soil is sandy, less fertile than the plains farther north where tobacco and rice thrive, but its geography favors trade. Goods from the mountains and plains converge here. Buses from Manila, or those plying north–south routes, make their stopovers here. La Union is “ready for SM,” Sy stressed. Official statistics agree: The province’s economy is 81% service-driven, with low poverty (8.7%), a 99% literacy rate, and the region’s lowest loans-to-deposit ratio (14.4%) — signs of stability and spending power. San Fernando, the capital, is a place shaped more by movement than by harvest. It hosts regional offices of national agencies, Region 1’s main public hospital, about a dozen private hospitals, nearly all universal, commercial and some rural banks, as well as some of the largest schools in northern Luzon. To the north, San Juan thrives on surf and the Manila weekend crowd. To the south, Bauang stretches along the West Philippine Sea, once home to high-end resorts that hosted the country’s elite until the late 1980s. San Fernando sits between them, the weekday capital that handles the province’s governance and trade. The balance among these three towns mirrors La Union itself: leisure to one side, logistics on the other, bureaucracy in the middle. It is a rhythm of contrast. And the new mall now sits right at its center. But like other century-old city centers, San Fernando’s is bursting at the seams. The MacArthur National Highway slices through narrow streets that loop around the Saint William the Hermit Cathedral, city hall, public market, and city plaza. Small groceries and hardware stores, still family-run, crowd the ground floors of aging buildings. “Our city proper is beyond full,” explained La Union Representative Paolo Ortega. By nightfall, most storefronts close, leaving the city hushed except for pharmacies and ATMs glowing under fluorescent light. Ortega said that around 2014, SM had originally looked at a possible site along the road leading to Poro Point Freeport Zone, a former American military base jutting into the West Philippine Sea. The area was just about six hectares, but the parties did not agree on the land price. SM eventually settled three kilometers east of the old center, in Barangay Biday, along the Diversion Road built years earlier to reroute traffic. The current 9.8-hectare site was easier to consolidate and allowed room for expansion. La Union was no stranger to malls before SM arrived. San Fernando already had community centers such as CSI Mall and Manna Mall, while nearby Bauang hosted smaller strip complexes serving weekend tourists. In 2021, Robinsons Place La Union opened a 4-level mall along the highway, with 35,000 sqm of gross floor area and a 9-level parking building for almost 500 vehicles. What distinguishes SM City La Union is scale and scope: 51,000 sqm of leasable space across 3 levels, 1,104 parking slots, and a 5,000-sqm transport terminal. With a reach closer to a regional hub than a neighborhood arcade, Ilocanos who once traveled an hour uphill to SM Baguio or two hours south to SM Rosales felt that, finally, they had one of their own. “We’re not really only just after the town,” remarked Sy. “We’re making it a destination for the other people from the nearby towns.” SM City La Union expects up to 25,000 mallgoers on weekdays and 30,000 on weekends. SM City La Union stands inland, but its design nods to the province’s coastal identity. Its ceilings ripple like waves, sunlight floods the atrium, and greenery softens the concrete. “We saw that San Fernando is already an economic hub. We just needed to blend in the ‘Elyu vibe,’” said Rona Vida Correa, SM’s Regional Operations head for Northern Luzon. “Elyu,” from the first letters of “La Union,” nods to the slow, easy, affordable lifestyle that has long drawn surfers and weekenders. Inside, shoppers pause at Where Joy Gathers, Isaiah Cacnio’s LED staircase glowing in ocean hues. Outside, Magwayen’s Chrysalis, Leeroy New’s bamboo-and-plastic sculpture, greets visitors at the entrance. A unique feature is the Sandbox, a 1,000-sqm open-air plaza of sand, benches, play equipment, and a small stage for events. “Our goal is [to make] this a hub where people not only shop but also learn and connect,” Correa said. National and regional brands mix with local tenants, such as Arkus Balay, Kayu Café, Bebo’s Bombay Burrito, Rufilita’s Bakeshop, Seawadeeka, The Lewis House, and La Gula Desserts. The country’s first J.CO Reserve also opened here, featuring a copper ceiling painted with ocean motifs. When asked about SM’s image as the “big, bad capitalist,” Correa described a corporate strategy rooted in what she called “progress that includes people.” Years before the mall opened, SM Foundation had donated a new two-storey, four-classroom building to a nearby public elementary school and granted scholarships to its students. “We also continue the Kabalikat sa Kabuhayan program with the Department of Agriculture to train farmers here and give them direct market access,” Correa said, referring to the produce under “Bonus” brand sold in the SM grocery. It’s about being “a good neighbor,” she said, and a “partner,” not an adversary. “We always tell our teams that we want to help the businesses in the mall — and the communities outside — to evolve.” San Fernando Mayor Hermenegildo Gualberto called the mall “a sign that San Fernando has arrived.” At full operation, he said, the complex will employ about 2,000 people, nearly 80% of them locals. Traffic remains his concern. “We’re trying to manage it. The traffic, we are prepared for it. Hopefully our strategies in managing traffic would work,” Gualberto said. The city continues to reroute vehicles to keep the narrow Diversion Road moving. An extension of the Tarlac-Pangasian-La Union Expressway (TPLEx) to San Juan, bypassing the clogged roads of San Fernando, is expected by 2028. The TPLEx has already cut travel time from Manila to northern Luzon and boosted tourist arrivals in La Union to over 540,000 in 2024. A fixture on tourist itineraries, Halo-Halo de Iloko is a converted ancestral home filled with Ilocano art and dishes. Founder Xavier Mercado built it long before “Elyu” became a hashtag. Now, he watches mall traffic pull away younger diners. “When I first heard that an SM mall would be built here, I was a mix of emotions — excited, nervous, and a bit skeptical,” Mercado said. “I was worried that people would flock to the new mall and forget about my humble establishment.” Since the opening, he said, “I’ve actually seen a decrease in customer flow and sales. I think it’s because SM brought in a lot of new choices of restaurants.” Yet he sees the development as a turning point. “For me, the SM mall symbolizes progress and convenience,” he said. “It’s a sign that our city is growing and moving forward. But it’s also a reminder that we need to adapt and evolve to stay competitive.” Mercado hopes large corporations and local government will treat small entrepreneurs as collaborators. “Local entrepreneurs like me are the backbone of this city,” he said. “We’re not just competitors, we’re partners in growth.” For Nicole de Leon, a 28-year-old content creator who relocated to San Juan from Manila, the mall’s arrival was more about practicality than spectacle. “From the perspective of buying essentials, I think that the mall provides convenience,” she said. “The locals are able to purchase a lot of their essentials or maybe some of the things that they want that they couldn’t buy before.” “A lot of stores have opened up that weren’t available here before,” she added. “As a girl, the variety of makeup now available here means I don’t have to them online. I can come here, test out the product. When I’m buying foundation, I can try what shade fits my skin.” Beside the complex, Annabelle Tan lives close enough to hear its pulse. “Too much noise,” she said. “Party sounds, all day, especially at night. And not just on weekends. Their speakers are massive.” Still, she noted its benefits — more jobs, more housing demand. “Transient demand is rising,” she said. Her insurance clients, she added, often mention how small shops outside the mall are losing customers. Some are still recovering from Typhoon Emong, a Category 4 storm that damaged many houses and buildings in July. “Many are still recovering,” she said. “And now SM is here.” By 7 pm, the old city’s shops are closed. But along the Diversion Road, headlights still stream past the mall’s façade. Inside, a movie begins. Outside, vendors sell grilled corn and fish balls under the blue light of the sculpture. “Bulabog is real,” Anna Belle said earlier, half-amused.

"MANILA, Philippines – Porac, Pampanga Mayor Jaime “Jing” Capil has been ordered arrested by a court for a criminal graft case in connection with the raided Lucky South 99 compound in his town. The warrant was issued by the Pasig City Regional Trial Court on Friday, November 28. As of posting Monday, December 1, the Philippine National Police (PNP) was still locating Capil to serve the warrant. The bail is set at P90,000 for seven counts of graft. Capil posted bail on Tuesday, December 2, and secured temporary freedom. Capil has been charged with violating Sections 3(e) and 3(j) of the anti-graft law, which prohibit granting government permits to entities not qualified to it, and causing undue injury to the government. Capil is accused of granting permits to the Lucky South 99 POGO (Philippine offshore gaming operator) despite allegedly being aware of suspicious activities there. Lucky South’s officer, Cassandra Ong, and Harry Roque, who helped Ong renew their POGO license, are both evading their warrants for human trafficking. Ong has gone into hiding, while Roque is seeking asylum in The Netherlands — his application now referred to Austria, which granted him his Schengen visa. He is claiming that the charges are political persecution. Capil was reelected mayor of Porac in the May midterm elections, although his hold on the office is precarious due to legal hurdles stemming from the same case. The Ombudsman has disqualified him from public office, and a division of the Commission on Elections has declared his votes stray. He has been appealing these decisions, which have allowed him to maintain the status quo. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Porac, Pampanga Mayor Jing Capil ordered arrested for graft",https://www.rappler.com/nation/porac-pampanga-mayor-jing-capil-ordered-arrested-graft/,Rappler
"The Marcos administration on Tuesday, November 18, announced a “win for Philippine agriculture” and exports after US President Donald Trump signed a new executive order (EO) last week essentially reversing (though not fully) his reciprocal tariffs policy first announced in April 2025, meant to revitalize the US economy. In the case of the Philippines, it was initially 17% and then 20% tariffs slapped on Philippine goods, later reduced to 19%. (READ Vantage Point: Can the Philippines endure economic pain with Trump’s tariff?) According to the Palace, the new EO now allows more than $1 billion worth of mostly agricultural products of the Philippines — accounting for nearly half of the country’s US$14.5 billion exports to the US — to enter America duty free effective immediately. These include its major agricultural exports to the US — various coconut products and byproducts (e.g. dessicated coconuts, crude coconut oil, coconut water), mangoes, bananas, processed pineapples — which had faced a higher tariff rate, making them more costly to American consumers. One Philippine senior trade official attributed the policy reversal of Trump to the Philippines’ “patience” in dealing with the US, after many critics laughed at why other ASEAN countries, not even treaty allies, supposedly got better deals than the Philippines. Recall that last July, when President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. went to the US to meet with Trump, they agreed to bring down the tariff on Philippine goods from 20% to 19%, a 1-point reduction panned by many. At that time, Trump described Marcos as a “very tough negotiator…,” adding that “he loves your country.“ But what’s the more important — and perhaps underlying reason — why Trump signed his new EO? The policy reversal, dated November 14, came 10 days after Democrats won three local races — in New York City, Virginia, and New Jersey. Reuters news agency described the losses as a “barometer of how Americans are responding to Trump’s tumultuous nine months in office.” More importantly, the policy reversal comes in light of higher prices of select goods where Trump’s reciprocal tariffs have kicked in — and Americans feeling the impact on their pockets. CNN, for instance, cites the case of bananas, imported mostly from South America. Americans are paying 8% more for their bananas, the news outfit reports. Other reports cite higher prices for what many Americans love: steak. Which is why a number of American media outfits have linked the new Trump EO to US domestic politics and economy. “Trump scraps tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruit in a push to lower prices,” says the NPR or National Public Radio. “From McDonalds to Mortgages, Trump tries to reclaim affordability,” writes TIME Magazine. “Trump administration prepares tariff exemptions in bid to lower food prices,” reports the New York Times. Take note that in that EO, “Modifying the scope of the reciprocal tariff with respect to certain agricultural products,” and in the White House’s fact sheet about it, the Philippines isn’t even specifically mentioned since the unilateral policy reversal applies to many countries that export food to the US. In the White House’s fact sheet on the new EO, it talked about Trump’s trade deals with Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The White House says these agricultural products that now have zero tariffs are “not grown in sufficient quantities in the US.” It says: “The President has thus determined that certain agricultural products shall no longer be subject to the reciprocal tariffs. Some of these products include: So, the underlying reason behind the Trump policy reversal is essentially domestic. And many have included this new EO as part of the US president’s “TACO,” a new acronym that takes a dig at Trump’s supposed decision-making process: Trump Always Chickens Out. CNN, in its November 15 article on the policy reversal, says, “The latest TACO comes after voters, worried about affordability, gave Republicans a drubbing in recent off-year elections.” Philippine officials now say they’ll be working on other items that are still covered by the 19% reciprocal tariffs such as garments, textiles, furniture, automotive products, etc. Hopefully, these will also be included in Trump’s TACO. – Rappler.com",True,true,TACO: Why Trump walked back on 19% reciprocal tariff on Philippine agriculture,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/taco-donald-trump-reversed-reciprocal-tarriffs-philippine-agriculture/,Rappler
"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Francis Lim’s recent statement on the tiered public-float proposal serves as a firm reminder that the circular remains a living draft, not a predetermined outcome. By stressing that “no one should expect to have their way” and nothing is final, Lim positions the SEC as an institution committed to open consultation rather than regulatory capture. His message is aimed equally at large issuers lobbying for lower floats and investor groups pressing for stricter thresholds: the reform will move only on the strength of data, liquidity considerations, and long-term market impact, not on pressure campaigns or political noise. By asserting that the SEC “will decide solely on what is right for the market, not on who shouts the loudest,” Lim is signaling a recalibration of regulatory discipline at a critical moment for Philippine capital markets. The remark reinforces the agency’s independence and asserts that the final framework will balance competing interests with an eye toward credibility, liquidity depth, and investor protection. In a market hungry for both modernization and trust, this posture of principled neutrality may prove as important as the float reform itself. The arrival of Lim at the helm of SEC has injected an unusual burst of energy into a capital market long accustomed to incrementalism. Lim, a seasoned capital-markets lawyer and former Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) president, has wasted little time diagnosing the country’s structural deficiencies: too few listed companies, chronically shallow liquidity, and a regulatory architecture that has not kept pace with neither the scale of modern issuers nor the demands of global investors. In the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) cross-country comparisons, the Philippines consistently posts one of the lowest market-capitalization-to-GDP ratios among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and an anemic pipeline of new listings. For years, regulators lamented these indicators but delivered only modest reforms. Lim, to his credit, is attempting a more comprehensive reset. The OECD is a global policy institution made up of 38 member countries, mostly high-income economies, that work together to shape economic, social, financial, and regulatory standards. (READ: Value trap: Why the PSE is one of world’s worst-performing markets) The most controversial — and potentially transformative — piece of that reset is the SEC’s newly released exposure draft introducing a tiered minimum public-float framework for initial public offerings (IPO). It replaces the long-standing flat 20% rule with a size-sensitive ladder: 33% float for companies valued at P500 million or below; 25% for those up to P1 billion; 20% for those with mid-capitalization up to P50 billion; 15% for large issuers between P50 billion and P150 billion; and a sharply lower 12% for mega-capitalized ones above P150 billion, provided they still comply with minimum peso-value thresholds. Unsurprisingly, this triggered applause from some corners of the market and discomfort from others. Large issuers, particularly financial technology companies (fintechs) and conglomerate carve-outs contemplating blockbuster listings, see at last a regulatory regime that understands the absorptive limits of a shallow market. But governance advocates worry that a 12% float is dangerously thin, potentially entrenching already powerful controlling families, while conferring on them the reputational benefits of public status. As with most things in market microstructure, the truth lies in the interplay of incentives, liquidity dynamics, and regulatory discipline. To understand the logic of the reform, one must begin with the basic arithmetic of an IPO. Under the old flat 20% rule, a ₱300-billion company contemplating a listing would have been forced to unload ₱60 billion worth of shares. In a market where annual total turnover often hovers at levels smaller than that single issuance, such supply would overwhelm both domestic institutions and foreign funds. The policy, well-intentioned as it was, all but guaranteed that large, fast-growing companies would stay private, list abroad, or avoid the public markets entirely. The tiered framework is an explicit attempt to remove this structural bottleneck. By contrast, a small- or mid-sized issuer presents an entirely different problem. Thin public floats in the micro-cap and small-cap segment are notorious breeding grounds for cornering, insider-driven spikes, and price manipulation. Requiring a higher float — 33% for the smallest, 25% for the next tier — improves price discovery, broadens investor participation, and protects retail buyers who rely on transparent, competitive order books rather than insider networks. These companies tend to have limited analyst coverage, small free floats, and often volatile trading profiles. More public float in this space — not less — is precisely the corrective the market needs. Viewed through this lens, the tiering system is not a deregulation of floats; it is a reallocation of regulatory strictness. The SEC is tightening the float requirement where governance and liquidity risks are highest and loosening it where the 20% threshold was practically preventing listings altogether. In pure policy design terms, it is one of the more rational calibrations that the market has seen in a decade. But the reform’s potential must be weighed against its risks. A 12% float for mega-caps raises legitimate concerns about market integrity. In markets where shareholder activism is weak and related-party transactions remain a systemic governance challenge, allowing controlling shareholders to retain 88% of equity, while tapping public capital, magnifies the risk of minority squeeze-out, valuation opacity, and governance complacency. If the peso-value floor is not rigorously enforced, a mega-cap could list with just enough public shares to meet the letter of the rule, while starving the market of genuine liquidity. Worse, if such companies are admitted to the main index, passive funds with mechanical allocation rules would be compelled to buy into a tightly held name with limited free float, magnifying price distortion in both directions. For this reason, the float rule cannot be evaluated in isolation. It lives or dies based on the SEC’s ability to strengthen the surrounding regulatory guardrails: audit enforcement, related-party scrutiny, valuation standards, and disclosure discipline. This is where Lim’s broader reform agenda becomes relevant. The SEC under his leadership has begun clearing internal backlogs, simplifying procedural requirements, redesigning registration and IPO workflows, and pushing the implementation of the Capital Markets Efficiency Promotion Act (CMEPA). The commission is also refining the rules governing REITs, syncing reinvestment timelines with market realities and widening the definition of income-generating assets. On the non-bank financial side, consumer-protection reforms aim to curb abusive collection practices and strengthen disclosure obligations. In other words, the tiered float is arriving within a larger regulatory modernization plan, not as a standalone experiment. If the SEC follows through, this creates a scaffolding robust enough to support a more flexible float regime. The remaining question is whether such a regime is favorable to the market as a whole. On this, a forensic reading of liquidity mechanics, investor behavior, and historical precedent points to a cautiously affirmative answer. When markets lack sector diversity, foreign investors treat them as tactical short-term trades rather than strategic long-term allocations. A more flexible float structure is a prerequisite for bringing in the kind of mega-cap issuers that alter index composition, attract global funds, and produce spillover liquidity across the board. The biggest unknown is issuer behavior. Will SMEs balk at the higher float requirement and opt out of the IPO track altogether? Possibly. Some family-owned businesses may prefer debt or private equity to preserve control. But others — especially those eyeing expansion capital — may find that a larger float broadens their appeal and stabilizes post-IPO trading. Conversely, will mega-caps list more readily now that they can float 15% or 12% instead of 20%? Yes. The cost-benefit calculus shifts, particularly for issuers whose scale would have required unloading tens of billions of pesos under the old rule. Ultimately, the tiered float framework is not a guarantee of market revival. It is merely the removal of one of the structural barriers that kept the market stagnant. Its success will hinge on execution: whether the SEC enforces the new rules without exception, whether it cracks down on valuation abuses like the recent audit and appraisal controversies, and whether the exchange revisits index inclusion rules to avoid overweighting tightly controlled companies. Francis Lim has placed a strategic wager: that market expansion, not rigid governance orthodoxy, is what the Philippine capital market needs most at this moment. It is a bet grounded in the economic realities of a shallow market that must compete regionally for listings, liquidity, and investor attention. But it is not without risk. A float that is too low can breed opacity; a float that is too high for mega-caps can kill deals. The new framework attempts to walk that tightrope. The real test will come not in the rule’s publication, but in the deals it enables — or fails to enable — over the next 24 months. If major issuers finally list, if liquidity deepens, and if governance enforcement keeps pace, the reform will be remembered as the turning point. If not, it will join the long list of well-meaning regulatory adjustments that failed to move the needle. For now, the verdict is neither triumph nor cautionary tale. It is a rare moment of regulatory ambition in a market that sorely needs it. The revival of Philippine capital markets will require more than a new float regime. But without it, revival would not come at all. – Rappler.com Click here for more Vantage Point articles",True,true,[Vantage Point] SEC’s float gambit: Shaking the stock market from deep slumber,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-securities-exchange-commission-float-gambit/,Rappler
"On November 6, Thursday, the Institute for Solidarity in Asia (ISA) will mark its 25th anniversary — a milestone that, in a just and rational world — should be a national celebration. For a quarter of a century, ISA has worked quietly and methodically to transform how government works in the Philippines. It has coached bureaucracies into coherence, trained civil servants to think in terms of outcomes rather than excuses, and built a governance framework — the Performance Governance System (PGS) — that has turned public agencies once mired in inefficiency into models of competence. ISA’s achievements are real and measurable. Hundreds of public institutions have passed through its stages of reform, learning the vocabulary of accountability and strategy. The organization’s founders, led by the economist Jesus P. Estanislao, have done something extraordinary: they have attempted to make integrity procedural. In a country where reform has long been equated with rhetoric, ISA has given reform a grammar, a syntax, and, most crucially, a system. A post shared by Institute for Solidarity in Asia (@isacenterph) And yet, corruption remains, hydra-headed and unbowed, breeding faster than reform can chase it. As the anniversary approaches, one cannot help but ask: How can corruption remain so deep, so resilient, so omnipresent — if the nation’s most respected governance reform movement has been at work for 25 years? Every honest answer to that question must begin with Ferdinand E. Marcos. His two-decade regime did not invent corruption; it normalized it. It wove it into the muscle memory of the government. Marcos transformed graft from moral failure into a political operating system — institutionalizing bribery, patronage, and plunder so thoroughly that even after his ouster in 1986, the habits he created proved ineradicable. His dictatorship taught an entire generation that loyalty is currency, silence is virtue, and power is its own moral justification. When democracy returned, the old culture did not retreat; it simply adapted. It hid beneath democratic forms, disguising self-interest as public service, impunity as “business as usual.” The Marcos years did not merely damage institutions; they retrained the Filipino conscience, dulling its sensitivity to corruption. It left behind a moral infrastructure — invisible yet indestructible — that every reformer since has had to fight against. Nothing reveals this more starkly than the recent flood control scandal — billions of pesos siphoned from public coffers, disguised as infrastructure. Roads to nowhere, culverts to ghost towns, and budgets swollen like rivers after rain. This latest scandal is almost a parody of itself — a rerun so familiar that outrage has grown weary. It exposes the aching contrast between the world ISA envisions and the one we still inhabit. On one hand, civil servants stand on podiums declaring “good governance” and “institutional transformation,” armed with scorecards, strategy maps, and multi-sector councils. On the other hand, politicians and bureaucrats quietly arrange the diversion of flood funds while the real floods — of water, of waste, of moral decay — drown the very communities they swore to protect. It is as though two republics exist within the same archipelago: one that ISA is patiently constructing, and another that corruption has long claimed as its own. ISA’s model assumes that corruption can be countered by systems — that if you introduce discipline, define measurable goals, and reward merit, good governance will follow. The Performance Governance System (PGS) is, in this sense, a triumph of technocratic rationality. But corruption, in the Philippines, is not a systems problem. It is a cultural inheritance — part survival strategy, part social expectation, wholly human. It resides not in policies but in instincts: the impulse to protect kin before country, to conflate generosity with bribery, to mistake cunning for intelligence. ISA has done what few organizations have dared to do: it has built the architecture of integrity. But architecture cannot by itself change the climate. The Philippines remains humid with cynicism —a country where good governance is admired in theory and betrayed in practice. ISA can measure compliance, but it cannot measure conscience. It can teach institutions how to perform with efficiency, but not how to blush with shame. The enduring tension between ISA’s advocacy and the nation’s reality lies in what might be called the divide between framework and flesh. Frameworks are elegant, ordered, and moral by design. Flesh — the human element — is impulsive, fragile, and endlessly self-justifying. A government agency may earn “Institutionalized” status under the PGS yet still play the old game of political patronage. A local executive may quote ISA’s mission in speeches yet quietly sign off on padded contracts. It is not hypocrisy so much as dual citizenship: one foot in the Republic of Reform, the other in the Kingdom of Kickbacks. The Philippine bureaucracy often lives in two realities — the formal and the informal, the aspirational and the transactional. Reform frameworks like the PGS operate in the formal world, where metrics matter and ideals are displayed. But corruption thrives in the informal one, where personal debts and family loyalties decide everything. Until those two worlds are reconciled — until governance becomes not just procedural but cultural — corruption will always have the upper hand. And yet, dismissing ISA as futile would be unfair — even cruel. Over the past 25 years, the Institute has produced “Islands of Good Governance” — hospitals that serve with compassion, local governments that plan with foresight, and agencies that deliver measurable results. These are not illusions; they are proofs of concept. But every island, no matter how virtuous, is surrounded by an ocean. And the waters — turbulent, polluted, morally treacherous — remain unchanged. ISA’s challenge for its next 25 years is not to multiply islands, but to transform the sea itself. To make good governance not an exception to Filipino culture, but its expression. That, of course, is not a technical task. It is a spiritual one. What perhaps haunts the Philippine reform story most is the peculiar fatalism of its people — the quiet belief that corruption is inevitable, like traffic or typhoons. We speak of graft with the same weary humor we reserve for bad weather. This surrender — subtle, smiling, collective — is the oxygen corruption breathes. ISA can design systems of accountability, but it cannot yet design outrage. It can build performance dashboards, but it cannot build citizens who refuse to look away. Until Filipinos cease to tolerate corruption — until we treat it not as inconvenience but as desecration — no reform, however noble, can fully prevail. As November 6 draws near, and ISA commemorates 25 years of laborious, hopeful work, the celebration must also be a moment of reckoning. The Institute has proven that reform is possible — but the Republic has shown that reform is not yet sufficient. ISA has unquestionably illuminated what good governance can be. The question is whether the Philippines — bruised, cynical, addicted to shortcuts— truly wants to be governed well. Corruption endures not because ISA has failed, but because we have refused to evolve. We remain, as ever, a nation of extraordinary intelligence and astonishing tolerance — outraged by scandal in public, and yet privately resigned to its inevitability. On November 6, as reformers gather to mark a quarter century of hope, perhaps the truest way to honor ISA’s legacy is not through ceremony but through a collective and individual examination of conscience — to finally confront the moral paradox that has defined and shackled us: that in the Philippines, the architecture of integrity stands tall, yet beneath it, the foundations are still quietly eroding. The organization founded by a Harvard-trained Filipino economist continues to drive the moral awakening happening today, in the context of the unprecedented magnitude of the flood control projects scandal. The organization is well-positioned to “transform the sea” itself. – Rappler.com Disclosure: The author is the founder and managing partner of a public relations and digital marketing agency.

"MANILA, Philippines – The Po family’s agribusiness continues to ride the global consumer shift toward healthy food and active lifestyles. Agribusiness conglomerate and food exporter Century Pacific Food Incorporated (Century Pacific) said on Thursday, October 16 that it acquired another integrated coconut processing facility in Mindanao, this time in Tupi, South Cotabato, from legacy firm Roxas and Company for P2.6 billion. Century Pacific, which supplies raw material for the international coconut water brand Vita Coco, said the acquisition would boost its coconut processing capacity. “Across the globe, the demand for coconut products is on the rise, underpinned by long-term shifts toward healthier consumption and wellness-oriented lifestyles. As one of the world’s top coconut producers, the Philippines enjoys a competitive edge, with Century Pacific among its emerging players playing in both export and domestic markets,” Century Pacific said in a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange. Last January, Century Pacific renewed its long-term P14-billion contract with The Vita Coco Company, which has become a leader in coconut water globally. Global pop icons such as Madonna and Rihanna, as well as sports celebrities like American tennis player Amanda Anisimova, have endorsed Vita Coco. A post shared by Vita Coco (@vitacoco) Coconut water is being marketed as a “natural source of electrolytes and antioxidants” that are needed for good health and hydration. In 2024, Century Pacific’s growth was driven by its OEM exports such as coconut water concentrates. The company attributed the 36% growth year-on-year to “a favorable commodity cycle and strong demand for healthier products.” Century Pacific said the acquisition of the integrated coconut facility was via its wholly owned subsidiary Coco Harvest Incorporated, which bought it from Roxas and Company subsidiary Roxas Sigma Agriventures Incorporated. “The plant currently produces high-value coconut products such as coconut cream, coconut milk, virgin coconut oil, and coconut water concentrate. Planned enhancements will further expand its capabilities to serve both domestic and export markets, adding new product lines and improving overall efficiency,” Century Pacific said. Century Pacific has two other coconut processing hubs in Mindanao, one in General Santos City, and another in Misamis Occidental. Roxas and Company said proceeds from the sale of this facility will be used to pay off the debts and liabilities of Roxas Sigma. It was also in line with the legacy firm’s decision to focus on developing its landholdings in Nasugbu, Batangas. Roxas Sigma’s coconut processing facility started commercial operations in 2018 producing all-natural coconut cream and milk, coconut water concentrate, and virgin coconut oil to clients worldwide. It has around 150 regular workers. The facility it sold is also a big buyer of dehusked nuts and helps provide livelihood in South Cotabato. “We are confident that Century’s plans to upgrade the facility will usher in a new phase of growth and expanded product offerings,” said Antonio Roxas, Roxas Sigma’s business development manager. With the acquisition, Century Pacific said its coconut operations will employ around 800 workers in Mindanao. “This acquisition is a milestone for our coconut business and a testament to our commitment to inclusive growth. By expanding our capacity in coconuts, we not only enhance our competitiveness in the global coconut industry but also create meaningful economic opportunities for local communities in Mindanao,” said Noel Tempongko, vice president and general manager of Century Pacific’s OEM Coconut Exports. An OEM or Original Equipment Manufacturer produces raw materials or parts that another company needs. “The additional capacity will allow us to innovate and serve the market with more high-quality, better-for-you coconut products, supporting our mission to deliver affordable nutrition to our consumers,” Tempongko added. Century Pacific ventured into the coconut industry in 2012, manufacturing coconut water for OEM exports. It also produces and exports the coconut water brand Aqua Coco. It has since expanded its manufacturing capabilities to include a wider range of products such as Coco Mama Fresh Gata. In 2020, Century Pacific ventured into the vegan meat alternative with its unMEAT products. Aside from the Philippines, these products are now sold in over 13,000 points of sale in the US, Singapore, China, Middle East, and Europe. A post shared by unMEAT (@meetunmeat.ph) The Century Pacific Group was started in 1978 by Ricardo Po Sr., focused on exporting canned tuna, with famous brands like Century Tuna, 555, and Ligo. It has since grown the business into other food-related businesses, including meat (e.g. Argentina brand), and dairy (e.g. Birch Tree, Angel). – Rappler.com",True,true,Century Pacific buys another coconut facility.

The latter manages the state-owned power grid. During SGP’s annual stockholders meeting on Thursday, October 16, Coyiuto was not elected as a director for the 2025 to 2026 period after 13 years in SGP’s leadership. Coyiuto and Henry Sy Jr. each own 38.94% of SGP, according to the company’s latest list of top 100 stockholders. Sy was reelected as chairman of SGP’s board, but Coyiuto is no longer listed as vice chair and director. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Friday, October 17, SGP clarified that Coyiuto remains a shareholder of the company, and that the new directors were nominated by current shareholders. Coyiuto’s seat went to SGP’s treasurer and chief finance officer Justice Lady P. Soriano. She was appointed to the post in 2021 following the resignation of treasurer and director Dave Nhowel Asejo to pursue other engagements. Another newcomer to SGP’s board is independent director Daniel Ibasco. He is the owner and co-founder of investment banking boutique Fortman Cline Capital Markets, and previously served as managing director of American investment banking firm Bear Sterns. Ibasco replaced Saturnino Juan as independent director after the latter’s appointment as Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) chair. Coyiuto’s exit from SGP’s leadership has rekindled talks that the Maharlika Investment Corporation (MIC), which runs the Philippines’ first sovereign wealth fund called Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF), finalized a deal to secure 20% of the grid operator. SGP clarified that negotiations with MIC are still ongoing, as they are still discussing detailed terms of the deal. “Given the scale and strategic nature of the investment, extensive due diligence and coordination among parties in SGP are required. Discussions also continue on the investment structure and governance arrangements to ensure alignment with shareholder and regulatory expectations,” the company wrote. MIC first bought a 20% slice of SGP back in January for P19.7 billion in preferred shares as its maiden investment, giving the government two board seats. MIC President Rafael Consing Jr. previously said the investment aims to lower electricity prices and give the government a bird’s eye view of how the NGCP is run.

"MANILA, Philippines – Let’s get the facts out of the way first. The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) did not lose P1.7 trillion in market capitalization. That number came from Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Francis Lim, who suggested that fleeing investors had wiped out that much in just three weeks because of the flood control corruption scandal. Shocking — but not true. Lim has since retracted the statement and apologized, saying he relied on what he believed was a credible report, which turned out to be “fictitious.” It’s a painfully ironic mistake for the country’s market watchdog, warning of “weak integrity” in the system while falling for fake data himself. Malacañang’s investment czar Frederick Go quickly corrected this, saying Lim was “quoting off a confirmed fake news post designed to catch attention and falsely sensationalize.” The real figure, according to PSE president Ramon Monzon, was far smaller. “PSE data shows that only P185 billion in market capitalization was lost during the three-week period in question,” he said. Setting aside the deeply unsettling fact that even the SEC chief is susceptible to fake news, Lim’s point still stands: the Philippine stock market is weak and confidence remains shaky. Corruption can indeed be, as he put it, a “weapon of mass wealth destruction.” [Closer Look] SEC chair error shows how we fall prey to disinformation Even PSE president Ramon Monzon agreed, saying, “SEC Chairman Francis Lim is correct in assailing the level of corruption in the country and its adverse effects on the economy and financial markets.” Rappler had also earlier pointed out how the flood control scandal and the broader corruption narrative could weigh on foreign investments, both in the markets and beyond. The PSE index (PSEi) has been struggling in recent weeks. From 6,264 in mid-September, it slipped to around 6,057 by October 9, briefly falling below the 6,000 level that traders see as a psychological floor. The drop has been broad but holding firms have been hit the hardest since they are heavily represented in the index. “When the overall economic outlook dims due to governance concerns, these conglomerates tend to bear the brunt,” Jarrod Tin, equity research analyst at DragonFi, told Rappler on Thursday, October 9. “Property, REITs, and banks are also weak — but mostly in response to BSP’s interest rate path rather than political noise.” There’s never one clear answer to what causes market volatility. That said, it’s important to put the market sell-off in perspective. Analysts note that the weakness in the PSEi isn’t driven by corruption alone. “It’s a mix of all factors,” Tin said. “With corruption as a persistent negative backdrop, different types of investors are losing confidence in the Philippines and expressing it by selling local equities.” Remember, the PSE is largely driven by foreign investors. Year-to-date, about 47% of all transactions in the PSE were foreign, and they’ve already sold about P43.8 billion more shares than they’ve bought. “Continued net foreign selling underscores that foreign investors remain cautious and are still offloading Philippine shares,” Tin said. In simple terms, more money is leaving rather than entering. When foreign funds exit, local institutions usually follow. One reason why is because foreign players dominate large, index-moving stocks that set the tone for the market. The result: a sell-off. But this retreat didn’t start with the flood control scandal. Investor confidence had already been under pressure from several fronts, such as tighter rules on online gambling, the Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGO) saga, and lingering red tape. Add to that the continued tensions in the Middle East, the threat and reality of a US government shutdown, and uncertainties of how tariffs will affect global markets, and it’s clear that sentiment was already fragile before corruption further burdened the attractiveness of the Philippine market. Markets run on perception, and right now, investors simply aren’t feeling optimistic about the Philippines. “Many investors have shifted to fixed-income assets like bonds and money market funds. Meanwhile, riskier assets such as crypto continue to outperform, and the US market enjoys strong momentum from the AI boom. Even several local influencers once focused on Philippine stocks have pivoted toward global stocks and crypto content,” Tin told Rappler. In the short term, it’s been a rough stretch for anyone with local equity exposure. If you hold an index-tracking fund, chances are you’re in the red. The PSEi has offered little room for outperformance, especially when stacked against the S&P 500, which has recently kept setting new record highs. Take a simple one-year comparison. Excluding dividends and fees, and taking prices as of October 8, the PSEi’s return over the past 12 months is about –19%. That means if you had invested P100,000 in a PSEi-tracking fund in October 2024, your investment would now be worth just around P81,000.Now look at the S&P 500, which has climbed 17% over the same period. That same P100,000 invested in a US index fund would have grown to roughly P117,000.When you put those numbers side by side, it becomes quite clear why investors would rather put their money in other markets or asset classes. Tin said the local index has become “a poor benchmark for alpha generation,” adding that investors looking for better upside may find it in thematic or sector-based strategies beyond the main index. Still, not everything is doom and gloom. Despite the bearish environment, it doesn’t necessarily mean that Philippine companies are bad. Rather, it’s a reflection of market sentiment. “The current market weakness is driven largely by fear and sentiment,” Tin told Rappler. “Stripping away the corruption narrative, most Philippine companies continue to post solid fundamentals and are expected to sustain earnings growth in the near term.” Even strong companies can look undervalued when investors are pulling out. Prices fall not necessarily because performance is poor, but because capital is leaving. That’s part of why conglomerates like SM and Megaworld have launched share buyback programs worth billions of pesos, signalling that they believe the market is undervaluing their companies. Tin said the pessimism may already be overdone. “If corruption issues have already peaked, conditions could improve from here,” he said. A rebound to around the 6,500 level by year-end is possible, especially if the upcoming third-quarter earnings season delivers solid results. “Investors should look beyond the noise and focus on fundamentals, the DragonFi analyst said. “There remain many undervalued dividend-paying opportunities in the market.” – Rappler.com Finterest is Rappler’s series that demystifies the world of money and gives practical advice on managing your personal finances.",True,true,"[Finterest] PSE may not have lost P1.7-T, but its weakness is still a problem",https://www.rappler.com/business/finterest-why-philippine-stock-exchange-weak-october-2025/,Rappler
"The National Transmission Corporation (TransCo) has released projected Green Energy Auction (GEA) rates for various renewable energy batches (GEA 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6) covering years 2025 to 2050. Although the table appears highly technical — with columns of CRR (Cost Recovery Rates) expressed as pesos per kilowatt-hour (₱/kWh) — it tells a simple story: renewable energy costs will rise sharply entering 2030, then gradually decline over the long term. This table (above) foretells the country’s march to the most consequential decade of its renewable-energy transition. For years, policymakers promised cheaper, cleaner power once the country ramps up green capacity. Yet, newly released projections from TransCo paint a more nuanced picture — one that rewards long-term thinking but demands brutal honesty in the near term. TransCo’s GEA-All Rate Estimate, covering Green Energy Auction rounds 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, offers a comprehensive look at how much cost consumers may shoulder to support the country’s aggressive renewable build-out from 2025 to 2050. The message is that transition will not be smooth, and renewables will not immediately translate into cheaper electricity. Costs rise materially as massive new capacities come online around 2030. Only afterwards do they settle into a long-term downward glide. For an economy still struggling with high power prices, fragile grids, and fossil-fuel volatility, understanding this curve is not optional. It is essential for everyone who relies on electricity. Between 2030 and 2033, the estimates show a pronounced increase in the CRR — the amount the system must recover per kilowatt-hour. Across all tariff scenarios, the same story emerges: GEA-5 and GEA-6 change the game. GEA-5 alone brings in 3.3 gigawatts of new renewable capacity — arguably the single largest green-energy commitment in Philippine history. But big capacity comes with big price tags: tariff assumptions hover at ₱12/kWh for GEA-5 and ₱10/kWh for GEA-6. The result? Under the standard ₱4/kWh scenario, the average GEA-All rate jumps to ₱0.6286/kWh from 2030-2033. In the more conservative ₱3/kWh scenario, it climbs to ₱0.8507/kWh. In plain English: 2030 is the year when the Philippines pays the “entry fee” for large-scale renewable energy. This spike is not a sign of market failure. It is the natural economic profile of green transitions worldwide: upfront pain for long-term payoff. Interestingly, CRR figures from 2025 to 2027 show minimal — even negative — rates. This does not suggest lower electricity bills. Instead, it reflects: These are artificial cushions. They will not survive the surge of renewable energy commitments beginning 2028 onward. The most important takeaway — the one that should guide CEOs, investors, and policymakers — is what happens after the 2030–2033 shock period. From 2034 to 2050, the CRR steadily drops across all tariff scenarios: The long-term trend is unmistakable: renewable energy becomes progressively cheaper over time, eventually outperforming fossil fuels, even after factoring in all cost recoveries. This tail-end decline is consistent with global experience. As capacity scales, technology costs fall, financing becomes cheaper, and operational efficiencies compound. In short: green energy is expensive to build but cheap to run. But the real story that separates this decade from the next is not solar, not onshore wind, and not even geothermal — it is offshore wind (OSW). Its economics, price impact, and timing will determine whether the Philippines sails smoothly into the renewable future, or locks itself prematurely into decades of elevated costs. TransCo’s projections point to a clear two-phase pattern: This is driven by the entry of GEA-5 and GEA-6, including early-stage OSW. High early tariffs — ₱10 to ₱12 per kWh — push CRR sharply upward in the early 2030s. Power-intensive industries will feel this immediately. After 2034, as renewable assets amortize and the country’s total generation capacity expands, CRR levels ease and flatten. This is where renewables outperform fossil fuels: expensive, entering the system; cheap, sustaining it. But this simple two-phase model hides a deeper and more consequential dynamic: the effect of OSW costs diluting over time as the total energy pie grows. Offshore wind is the most capital-heavy renewable technology in the pipeline. Its Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) remains significantly higher than solar, onshore wind, or even geothermal. But here’s the nuance often lost in public discourse: the cost impact of OSW decreases over time — not because OSW gets cheap, but because everything else around it grows. As solar, battery storage, onshore wind, and geothermal expand, the total generation base of the Philippines grows dramatically. The OSW cost, while still high, becomes a thinner slice of a much larger pie. That dilution effect is real, measurable, and supportive of long-term energy stability. However — and this is the key message for policymakers — the dilution does not eliminate the drag; it only distributes it. OSW will still impose a significant price impact for years. It will be a burden on the grid before it becomes a strategic advantage. And this is where the Philippines must avoid locking itself too early into massive OSW commitments. Without strategic timing, the Philippines risks repeating the early solar mistakes of other countries: committing too early at high LCOEs, only to watch prices collapse a few years later. There are three rational strategies to avoid an unnecessary price burden: Wait for the LCOE to drop significantly — just as solar photovoltaic (PV) did over the last decade. OSW is still in its expensive phase globally. Early adopters pay a premium. Instead of committing 3,300 MW upfront, begin with a few hundred megawatts.Learn from implementation, build supply-chain expertise, train the workforce, and only scale when costs materially decline. A measured hybrid: small early OSW deployments for knowledge-building, combined with postponed large-scale capacity until economics improve. The Philippines does not need 3.3 GW of OSW today. What it needs is timing, sequencing, and discipline. Another strategic question is whether OSW will remain the highest-cost renewable over the next decade. The answer is increasingly: not necessarily. The GEA framework may soon include technologies such as: Any of these technologies could compress the cost curve further. If they become viable, OSW’s relative role — and its economics — will shift dramatically. In other words: locking into 3,300 MW of OSW today may close the door to cheaper technologies tomorrow. Offshore wind will almost certainly play a major role in the Philippines’ energy future. Its scale, reliability, and capacity factor make it a strategic anchor for a mature renewable grid. But this role must be earned through timing — not forced through early commitment. OSW’s cost curve will decline. The energy pie will grow, diluting OSW’s price impact. But none of this justifies a premature 3,300 MW lock-in. The next decade is about managing cost turbulence while building the foundations of a stable, diversified renewable grid. Offshore wind is part of that future — but not at any price, and not at any pace. The discipline to sequence OSW, backload large-scale deployment, and allow the energy pie to grow first will determine whether the Philippines becomes a regional energy leader — or saddles consumers with unnecessary costs during the most economically sensitive decade in its energy transition. As new renewable capacity under GEA-5 and GEA-6 enters the grid — particularly early-stage offshore wind — the system’s CRR rises sharply. These technologies are still expensive, and early-stage OSW carries some of the highest costs in the renewable spectrum. Tariffs of ₱10-₱12 per kWh for OSW generation translate into system-wide CRR increases that will eventually filter into consumer generation charges. The spike between 2030 and 2033 will not be theoretical; it will appear in actual monthly bills. This is the transition pain that every country goes through. But the Philippines risks amplifying that pain if it mismanages OSW timing. Some policymakers argue that OSW costs will “dilute” in the future. That is true — but not for the reasons the public thinks. The cost impact of OSW declines not because OSW itself becomes cheaper, but because the total national power supply will grow. A larger energy “pie” means OSW becomes a smaller, thinner slice. Its cost remains high, but it is spread over a larger base of generation from solar, geothermal, onshore wind, and storage. Yes, OSW costs will look smaller on a pesos-per-kWh basis over time — but this dilution takes years. Meanwhile, Filipino households will shoulder the early surge. Even if diluted over time, OSW still imposes a significant price burden in its early deployment years. Consumers will pay: Filipinos already face among the highest electricity rates in Asia. Careless OSW timing can push that burden even higher. This is the price impact that households cannot afford — and one that government can still avert. Based on my talks with well-placed friends in the energy sector, if the Philippines wants OSW to succeed without punishing the public, it must change its sequencing. 1. Postpone large-scale OSW until costs fall significantly. Offshore wind today is where solar PV was 15 years ago — expensive, immature, and volatile in cost. Waiting could cut future LCOE by 40-60%, based on global trendlines. 2. Start small instead of committing 3,300 MW immediately. A few hundred megawatts of OSW — pilots — would allow the country to learn: Small-scale today shields consumers from large-scale price shocks. 3. Use a blended strategy. Deploy minimal OSW first, delay the rest until the economics are better. This approach protects consumers while keeping the country on the OSW roadmap. The best transitions are not those done fastest, but those done smartest. Another overlooked factor is competition. The GEA mechanism may later support emerging technologies: If the Philippines locks into 3,300 MW of expensive OSW too early, consumers will lose the chance to benefit from future technologies that could be far cheaper. It would be the ultimate irony: Filipinos end up paying high prices for outdated technology because government committed too early. Offshore wind will eventually play a major role in stabilizing the Philippine grid. It provides scale, reliability, and baseload-like characteristics. But these advantages only materialize when OSW becomes cost-competitive. The public should not be forced to subsidize the learning curve of a technology that is not yet financially mature, especially when cheaper alternatives exist today. If the government gets the timing right: If it locks into OSW too early: In this transition, timing is everything. And the Filipino public — already burdened by one of the priciest power markets in Asia — simply cannot just afford this. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] Why the Philippines should slow down on offshore wind transition,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-why-philippines-should-slow-down-offshore-wind-energy-transition/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines’ unemployment rate worsened to 5% in October 2025 as the labor market struggled to absorb an influx of job seekers, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Wednesday, December 10. The latest unemployment figure translates to 2.54 million jobless Filipinos, which is higher than the 3.8% or 1.96 million Filipinos recorded in September 2025 and the 3.9% or 1.97 million jobless Filipinos logged in October 2024. Underemployment in October also grew to 12%, equivalent to 5.81 million Filipinos, from 11.1% or 5.52 million Filipinos in September. National Statistician Dennis Mapa noted an increase in labor force participation, which includes Filipinos who are working and seeking jobs. “Ang labor force participation tumaas ng mga 1.04 million…. Out of those additional na nag-participate, 463,000 ang nagkaroon ng trabaho at 576,000 ay hindi nagkaroon ng trabaho,” he explained. (Labor force participation went up by around 1.04 million. Out of those additional people who participated, 463,000 got jobs and 576,000 did not.) The public administration sector added the most jobs in October year-on-year with 257,000 additional workers. Jobs in agriculture and manufacturing — two sectors which often shed jobs earlier in the year — also gained more workers in October. Mapa attributed the agriculture sector’s job gains to a surge in jobs tied to the growing of palay, which he noted usually peaks in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, jobs in other service activities such as computer repairs, personal and household goods, laundry services, and domestic services dropped by 520,000 year-on-year. The number of Filipinos aged 15 to 24 years old who are not working or studying also increased to 13% or 2.62 million young Filipinos. The Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) vowed to integrate labor market information to improve industry-skills matching. DEPDev Secretary Arsenio Balisacan also noted that generating more quality jobs depends on the implementation of the Trabaho Para sa Bayan Plan and the Philippine Development Plan. “Guided by these plans, the government will boost workforce competitiveness by accelerating learning pathways and expanding lifelong learning opportunities, equipping workers with in-demand skills such as digital literacy, green technology capabilities, and expertise in higher-value services,” he said. – with reports from Arriane dela Cruz/Rappler.com Arriane dela Cruz is a Rappler intern.

"MANILA, Philippines – There’s a particular kind of optimism that shows up around New Year’s. You open your banking app with the seriousness of someone about to turn their whole life around, promise yourself you’ll be more “disciplined” this time, and then quietly hope that motivation will carry you through February, March, and the months when the calendar stops feeling symbolic. It won’t. Not because you’re weak-willed, but because good money habits work best as systems. If you want 2026 to feel different, you don’t need to do some dramatic overhaul of your personal finances. Instead, let’s start with these three boring things done consistently: set a goal you can measure, build a budget you can actually live with, and, if you have room, start dipping your toes into investing with your eyes open. Most people begin the year with intentions that feel responsible but are impossible to follow. “Save more.” “Spend less.” “Be better with money.” All good ideas — but unfortunately all directionless. A useful goal is specific enough that you can’t argue with it. It has a number and a deadline. It is not purely aspirational, but it should still feel slightly difficult, because that tension is what forces you to adjust your spending behavior. One simple place to start is an emergency fund. The basic target many people aim for is around three months of salary set aside for emergencies. So, where do you put your emergency fund? You shouldn’t chase yield here or park it in an investment product. Prioritize liquidity because you need speed and certainty of access when something goes wrong. Keep your emergency fund in a stable bank account you can tap quickly, ideally one with reliable online banking and easy ATM access where you live. But even “build an emergency fund” can remain vague unless you break it into checkpoints. It’s easier to commit to a halfway marker than to a year-long fog. A goal might look like this: “By June 2026, I should have at least one month’s worth of salary parked in my emergency fund.” That’s a concrete milestone you can hit halfway through the year, and it’s easy to verify. After goals, most people run straight into budgeting, and this is where a lot of plans quietly die. They pick an overly strict number, decide they will be a new person starting January, and then spend the rest of the month feeling like they failed when real life refuses to cooperate. A budget only works if it is built on what you actually do. That’s why tracking comes first. In the Philippines, that tracking can be annoying. Most of the time, you can’t simply link your bank debit or credit card to an app and have everything recorded automatically. You may have to manually log expenses in your budget app of choice as you go, which feels tedious. But just remember you need this data to form a reasonable baseline. The categories don’t need to be fancy. What matters is that they reflect the way your life is actually structured. For me, it’s groceries, utilities, rent, dining out, pets, transportation, and a small amount of fun money. That last category matters more than people admit. If you pretend you won’t spend on anything enjoyable, you’ll eventually spend anyway, just messier and with more regret. Now, after at least two months of tracking, you’ll have an idea of how much on average you spend per category. This can form the baseline for your budget. When setting your budget, the goal is not to squeeze every category to the point of misery. The goal is to make sure you are living below your means in a way that doesn’t rely on constant self-denial. One practical approach is to treat savings like a bill. Decide on a set percentage of your take-home pay that you will move to savings every month, perhaps up to 20% if you have that room, and then build your budget around what’s left. You’re flipping the logic around from saving whatever remains at the end to spending whatever remains after you saved. Rent is the biggest pressure point for many people, and it’s also the easiest category to let quietly take over your entire financial life. A commonly used benchmark is to try to keep rent within 30% of take-home pay. That is not always possible, but it is still a useful reference because it forces you to see the tradeoff clearly. If rent is taking more than that, the question becomes what you are giving up in exchange, and whether the exchange is still worth it. There’s a reason investing advice can feel alienating. A lot of people are still trying to stabilize, and it’s hard to talk about building wealth when you’re busy working to pay the rent. Not everyone is on the same timeline, and that’s fine. But if you do have some flexibility, investing is one of the few tools that can meaningfully change your long-term trajectory. You don’t need to start big. Starting with P1,000 to P5,000 can be enough to begin building familiarity, which is a bigger hurdle than most people realize. The first stage of investing is about simply learning how to react when prices move, when headlines feel scary, and when you’re tempted to do something impulsive. That’s why risk appetite matters. It just means knowing how much risk you can tolerate without panicking. After all, no investment is risk-free. Here’s a quick look at the different types of investments you can get into and their associated risk. Bonds are often described as stable and low-risk. The simplest way to understand them is that you are lending money to the government or a corporation and earning interest. Usually, they also come with a defined timeframe, which makes them easier to plan around. Save for a financial crisis, they’re usually safe too as whoever issuing the bond wouldn’t want to permanently tarnish their reputation by failing to meet payments. The catch is liquidity. If you need the money before the bond term ends, you may have to sell it on the secondary market, sometimes at a discount, and the process can feel less straightforward than selling a stock. Stocks are a different kind of commitment and are significantly riskier than bonds. They are more liquid and can offer more growth, but they require you to be intentional. Every stock is its own story, which means you need to know what you’re buying and why. Are you buying for growth or for dividends? What industry are you betting on? What rules will you follow for taking profit or cutting loss? If you enter without rules, the market will supply its own, and you won’t like them. For people who want exposure without constantly monitoring individual stocks, mutual funds and UITFs can be a middle path. They can help spread risk and allow you to tap professional management, which is useful if you don’t have the time or interest to do your own deep research. Funds can also be a way to get exposure to markets that feel harder to access directly, including US tech stocks, depending on what products are available to you. But you still need to understand what the fund holds, what timeframe it is built for, and what fees you are paying for that management. Fees matter because they quietly eat returns, especially over long holding periods. Then there are alternatives assets like crypto and precious metals, which tend to attract people who are bored by slow progress. Crypto can make people rich, and it can also wipe people out, sometimes faster than they thought possible. Gold tends to move differently from other assets and is often treated as a hedge when stock prices fall. These instruments can have a place for some people, but ideally as a smaller part of a broader mix, not the foundation of your entire financial life. – Rappler.com Finterest is Rappler’s series that demystifies the world of money and gives practical advice on managing your personal finances.",True,true,[Finterest] Start 2026 strong with these personal finance tips,https://www.rappler.com/business/finterest-start-strong-personal-finance-tips-2026/,Rappler

"Tax is the lifeblood of government, but when leakages and evasion drain the system, it is ordinary Filipinos who suffer. Despite economic growth averaging 5–6% in recent years, the Philippines’ tax-to-GDP ratio stood at 14.1% in 2023. This remains significantly below the OECD average of 34% and lags behind the Asia-Pacific region’s average of 19.5%. In fact, at 14.1%, the Philippines’ tax effort is lower than several regional neighbors, including Thailand (which reports figures around 15–17% depending on the methodology) and the average for the Asia-Pacific region. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has made progress through campaigns like RATE (Run After Tax Evaders) and RAFT (Run After Fake Transactions). But if we are serious about fighting corruption, closing loopholes, and financing sustainable development, we need sector-based enforcement that matches our GDP profile and industry risks. Alongside RATE and RAFT, the government must also look at the special economic zones. Under the CREATE MORE Act, the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) plays a critical role as the gatekeeper of tax incentives, ensuring that income tax holidays (ITH), the 5% special corporate income tax, VAT zero-rating, and more are granted only to compliant firms. Stronger coordination between PEZA and BIR can prevent leakages such as misdeclared exports or abuse of VAT exemptions, while still protecting the country’s competitiveness in attracting investors. In this way, incentives serve their purpose of fueling genuine economic activity instead of becoming grey areas for tax avoidance. Other countries show us what’s possible. Brazil closed its VAT gaps through the use of electronic invoicing. Estonia integrates tax, social security, and banking data into one digital identity system. South Korea links government procurement directly to tax reporting, reducing corruption. The Philippines doesn’t need higher tax rates; it requires smarter enforcement. When money is lost due to corruption or tax evasion, every peso represents a missed opportunity for classrooms, hospitals, and climate resilience initiatives.

"Before the SM Group bought a controlling stake in National University (NU) in 2008, NU had only one campus, in Sampaloc, Manila, with around 1,800 students. It also wasn’t doing well financially and was having difficulty getting enrollees after a fire destroyed its main building in 1998. Today, 17 years after the Sy family took over management of the school, it has around 84,000 students in 14 campuses with 4,000 faculty members. NU now has more students than the state university, UP (around 66,000 students for the whole UP system as of 2025). NU is unofficially the biggest school in terms of student population among the eight schools in the UAAP, which include Adamson University, Ateneo de Manila University (AdMU), Far Eastern University (FEU), De La Salle University (DLSU), University of the East (UE), University of the Philippines (UP), and University of Santo Tomas (UST). In the next two years, NU will add three more campuses: NU in Davao City, its 15th campus and its first in Mindanao, in 2026; NU in Iloilo City in 2027; and NU in Urdaneta, Pangasinan. It is also expanding four campuses: in NU Clark (Pampanga), NU Mall of Asia (Pasay), NU Fairview (Quezon City), and its main campus in Sampaloc, Manila. NU, one of the founders of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), used to be the perennial doormat in the league. After the SM Group took over, it’s been dominating the UAAP Cheerdance competition, and it made history on Saturday, November 29, after winning its 9th crown overall, one more than UP and UST. In 2014, NU, under then-head coach Eric Altamirano, defeated FEU and won it’s second men’s basketball championship in UAAP Season 77 after a 60-year drought. As of Sunday, November 30, the NU Bulldogs had the best record in Season 88 of the men’s basketball tournament going into the Final Four games which start on Wednesday, December 3. (READ: NU championship is a dream come true for member of 1954 Bulldogs team) NU has also been doing well in the now popular team sport of volleyball. The NU men’s team has won the past five UAAP volleyball championships, while the NU women’s team, led by star player Bella Belen, won the last two. How did the SM Group achieve these? Many perhaps think it’s because the Sy family has a lot of money, but it can be argued that taipan Lucio Tan also has the resources, but has not had the same success for the UAAP school he owns, UE. So, while money is important, there are other factors at play. SM founder Henry Sy’s college education was interrupted by World War II. He knew early on the importance of education as a great equalizer. He had set his sights on buying his alma mater FEU, but talks with its controlling owners, the Montinola family, didn’t pan out. The SM Group, however, still has a minority stake in FEU. He then pursued merger talks with the owners of NU, founded by Mariano Fortunato Jhocson in 1900. The school is commemorating its 125th year this 2025 with a grand celebration and concert at SM MOA Sky Ampitheater on Friday, December 5. After 10 years of merger talks, Sy bought a 60% majority stake in NU in 2008. Hans, in a recent NU1900 podcast, said his late father had always been a believer in education, and wanted providing affordable quality education to be his legacy. The Sy patriarch, fondly called “Tatang,” was already 80 when the SM Group took over management of NU in 2008, and he assigned to his fourth child, Hans, the task of rebuilding NU. Hans is chairman of NU. Meritocracy and a more professional management of NU was pushed, following the SM Group’s takeover. NU vice chairman and former NU president Teodoro J. Ocampo, a third-generation member of the Jhocson family, recalled that before the SM Group took over, all the key positions in NU were held by the children of the owners — from chairman, president, comptroller, registrar, athletic office, and purchasing office. “It was very close-knit, so you can imagine them not being open-minded to having partners,” he said in the NU podcast. After the SM Group took control, the original owners had to take a back seat. Not being an academic, Hans said his contribution to NU was to set the vision and the stategy. The academic side was delegated to now NU president and CEO Dr. Renato “RJ” Carlos Ermita Jr., who holds a doctorate in educational leadership and management from DLSU, Hans’ alma mater. “In terms of the academe, it’s RJ who is the one behind those things. I don’t try to be somebody I’m not, so I get the right guys,” Hans said. “Business-wise, we control the cost and other things, academe-wise, he (RJ) takes charge of it.” When the SM Group took over, the plan was to have 100,000 students by 2027, and it’s on track to meet that goal. Ermita said the goal is to make NU “truly national” by reaching out to more students. After determining NU’s main goals, Hans also laid out three key principles: stay focused on the goals and targets, and stay hungry in achieving the goals. “When you have both, there’s a good chance you will succeed,” he said, before adding the third principle, “And when you succeed, stay humble.” NU leveraged on the growth of SM Supermalls for its expansion. Hans said SM could have just donated money to fund more scholarships via its SM Foundation, but they decided on reaching out to more students by physically expanding the school. Take the case of the P2.3-billion redevelopment of SM City Iloilo, expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2026. The expansion of the mall includes construction of 23,670 square meters for the NU Iloilo campus, set to open in 2027. “As SM grows, NU grows as well, especially in the malls where we’re contributing to turning the mall into a community,” said Ermita in the NU podcast. “A school is an important component of any community. So the identity of the mall is also changing, it becomes younger, becomes vibrant. So the whole mall is like a campus of NU, in a sense, because you see our students being seen all over the mall.” For students, there are also advantages in having a school that is part of a mall. “Being within SM complexes gives our students immediate access to essential services like public transport, bookstores, and dining areas…,” said Ermita in an SM Investments Corporation November 17 press release. In line with Henry Sy’s wish to reach out to more students, NU follows SM’s affordable pricing policy which has contributed to SM’s overall success in retail. “Typical SM. It’s not the margin, it’s the volume,” Hans said in the podcast. He said this was the same tack taken by SM when it expanded its malls, especially outside Metro Manila. “I remember, when we started to go out of Manila, my father’s order was I want same price in all areas….,” he recalled his father telling him. “Just run it [NU] like a business, just make sure it’s affordable with quality.” The NU is among the most affordable among private non-sectarian schools with an average of P80,000 tuition per academic year. If compared to a June 2024 listing of tuition in select schools by personal finance platform MoneyMax, this is lower than DLSU’s average of around P205,000-P225,000 per year, and the Ateneo de Manila University’s average of P160,000-P180,000 per year. UP, of course, is the lowest among UAAP schools due to the free college education law. “We did a balancing act. RJ was able to maintain the quality. How to ensure the quality is there, he has increased the organization. With the support of management, we’ve upgraded the salaries of faculty without really increasing much the tuition,” said Hans. Included in the pricing strategy is to upgrade the school’s facilities without being extravagant. “If you notice the campus, there’s nothing fancy, very basic, very simple but very functional,” Hans said. The pricing policy has paid off as NU has been able to significantly increase its student population. Hans said NU is now profitable, and since the mission is to make education affordable, NU has been converted into a non-stock, non-profit institution. “This means half of the income goes to faculty development, the other half goes to school development,” he said. On the academic side, the NU made it for the first time in the latest QS or Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings 2026, a provider of analytics in the global higher education sector. The QS Rating assesses higher education institutions based on global standards, and helps students decide which university is best for them. NU was ranked 21st among Philippine universities and 185th in Southeastern Asia. NU secured a QS 3 Stars Rating overall with 5 Stars in employability, 4 Stars in teaching, 4 Stars in social impact, 4 Stars in facilities, and 4 Stars in good governance. Likewise, Ermita said NU also adopted SM’s strategy that puts a premium on customer service in its operations like the school registrar. “Because NU is part of SM, the assumption really is that number 1, we are very good in customer service, so we always challenge our people, that’s the expectation,” he said. When the SM Group took over, given the doormat reputation of the school, there was low pride in being associated with NU. That’s no longer the case. How did NU restore school pride? Hans said he used sports as a marketing tool and to shortcut the process of attracting more students to enroll in NU, given that it would take longer to achieve this academic-wise. He also stressed the relationship between the size of a school population and sports. “When we came in, it was just over 1,000 students only. How can you choose athletes with 1,000 population? Right now, it’s easy, we’re 85,000 students so it’s a lot easier to choose good athletes now,” he told his godson, basketball coach and sports analyst, Charles Tiu, in a recent BNC interview. Then-NU athletics director and veteran PBA player Joaquin “Chito” Loyzaga, in a Rappler article “Who let the NU Bulldogs out?” cited the following reasons for the success of the NU sports program: Another good hire was FEU alumna Ghicka Bernabe, who led the NU Pep Squad to seven championships in nine seasons before retiring as head coach in 2022. Before the SM Group took over in 2008, NU was in last place in the UAAP Cheerdance from 2002 to 2008. Dr. Otie Camangian, currently the NU sports and athletics director, also took note of the role played by Hans in the sports program. “He’s very hands on,” Camangian said in the BNC interview. “As much as his schedule permits…in pep rallies, he’s there; in athletes’ recognition, he’s there; in [UAAP] games, he’s there. He takes time talking to athletes, having selfies with them, very fatherly-like approach, which is very inspiring to athletes.” Today, graduating high school students, given a choice of which university to go to, no longer have just AdMU, DLSU, UST, or UP in mind but NU too. This was a goal which Loyzaga mentioned back in 2015 after NU won the men’s basketball tournament. And this is one aspect that Hans is particularly proud of. “Like what I’m doing with NU, the biggest turnaround I was able to do with NU is when I made the students proud of their school,” he said. And, there’s no stopping the SM Group from further expanding the school. It plans to have 20 NU campuses by 2028. UP currently has 17 campuses. “People tease us: do we intend to have as many campuses as SM’s (89) malls?” said Ermita. “The answer I always give is, as long as there are students in a particular area who are not served and are not given an opportunity to study well, we will try our best to be there.” Hans added: “People would now say, ‘Wow, you guys…you’ve made it already. But I say, no, we’re just starting.” At the rate the NU is expanding, it will likely be the biggest school in the whole country, not just in the UAAP. In a few years, it will be overtaking the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (with a population of 97,000). – Rappler.com",True,true,[BizSights] How SM rebuilt NU and made it the biggest school in UAAP,https://www.rappler.com/voices/rappler-blogs/bizsights-how-sm-group-rebuilt-national-university/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – An internal audit at the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) has flagged possible conflict-of-interest concerns involving Undersecretary David Almirol Jr. The internal audit comes after more than P1.5 billion in eGov-related contracts went to PLDT and its subsidiaries. A conflict-of-interest issue such as this, to put simply, questions whether the best choices for procurement were made for the most efficient use of the budget, or if people’s interests were prioritized the most. The eGov app is the government’s central mobile platform that consolidates national and local digital services. Through the app, users are supposed to be able to access business permitting, PhilHealth records, BIR services, PAG-IBIG transactions, eTravel registration, and more. In July 2025, President Marcos described Almirol as the one who personally wrote the app’s code. PLDT, which won at least eight e-Gov-related contracts since November 2023, has had a major ownership stake in Multisys since 2018, the software firm Almirol founded and led for more than a decade. Almirol, however, denied any conflict, saying the DICT also engaged other large service providers Globe and Converge, and that procurement is handled by another undersecretary. PLDT, for its part, said, “PLDT has followed all the appropriate processes, and we’re confident that any investigation will reveal the same.” Rappler’s review of Multisys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) found inconsistencies that make it hard to determine when Almirol actually gave up his Multisys shares. These raise questions about the truthfulness of the Multisys disclosures during Almirol’s transition into government. In some of the eight eGov-related contracts awarded to ePLDT beginning in November 2023, other PLDT-owned subsidiaries such as its mobile arm Smart and data center firm Vitro, or the parent firm PLDT itself, were named as co-contractors. These contracts were sealed when Almirol was already overseeing the rollout of the DICT’s flagship eGov app. Almirol took his oath as undersecretary of e-Government on August 4, 2022. These contracts included projects such as the deployment of the eGov app’s eLGU system, an online platform for acquiring business permits, managing the e-Government cloud services, and data center services. “It is a known fact that Undersecretary David Almirol is the founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Multisys Technologies Corporation, a privately held software engineering and digital solutions firm,” an internal audit report dated June 5, 2025 said. Considering this, the report noted that “a conflict of interest may arise” in the following circumstances: (1) hiring ex-Multisys personnel and 2) awarding contracts to ePLDT. At least one of the contracts referred to was awarded through a “negotiated procurement” process. This was a December 2023 contract worth more than P133 million given to ePLDT. A negotiated procurement is defined as one being “resorted to under extraordinary circumstances whereby the government directly negotiates a contract with a technically, legally and financially capable supplier, contractor or consultant. Negotiated procurement is allowed in cases of two failed biddings…” PLDT currently owns a 45.73% stake in Multisys — where it reportedly invested P2.15 billion in 2018. Of the 2018 PLDT investment, P500 million reportedly went directly to the owners of Multisys, Almirol included. At the time of PLDT’s 2018 investment in Multisys, the latter was expected to strengthen the digital initiatives of ePLDT, Voyager Innovations (Maya), and PLDT Enterprise. Almirol served as president and CEO of the company for over 10 years. He remained listed as president at least until a January 24, 2022 general information filing at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which Rappler obtained in the course of this investigation. Almirol disputed the audit’s findings. Citing data center contracts specifically, Almirol said, “Even before we came in, they were already using [PLDT] Vitro. We’re also using Globe’s MK [data center]. We’re also using Converge. It’s spread out. That’s why Globe and Converge have large contracts too. In fact, PLDT has the smallest share for data centers.” Rappler’s own investigation, however, unearthed inconsistencies in Multisys filings with the SEC. This raises questions over Almirol’s stake in the company. With Almirol at the helm, Multisys’ parent firm PLDT — including its ICT subsidiary ePLDT, mobile and connectivity service provider Smart, and data center arm Vitro Inc. — has since been awarded at least eight contracts involving the eGov app and related projects. The contracts total around P1.55 billion, according to documents obtained from the DICT procurement page. They are as follows, arranged by earliest to latest date: Rappler has reached out to DICT and Almirol multiple times to provide information on claimed eGov contracts with Globe and Converge. DICT is currently processing our freedom of information (FOI) request. Rappler will update this story once we have received the information. To Almirol’s credit, none of these contracts were awarded while he was still on record as owner or a member of the Multisys board of directors. Because of the company’s conflicting filings with the SEC, however, it is unclear when exactly Almirol divested his Multisys shares. Almirol took his oath as undersecretary of e-Government on August 4 2022. A review of Multisys’ submissions to the SEC reveals that the company filed its General Information Sheet (GIS) three times that year (2022). The first GIS filing — notarized on January 24, 2022 and received by the SEC at 8:41 am on January 26, 2022 — still listed Almirol as president with a 54.22% stake. A second GIS–notarized on October 27, 2022 and received by the SEC at 4:12 pm on November 2, 2022 — more than two months after he took his oath as undersecretary — still showed him as a stockholder with a reduced 49.21% stake. The third and final version, notarized on November 18, 2022 and received by the SEC at 3:30 pm on November 21, 2022 removed him from the stockholder list entirely. RA 6713, the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, requires officials to divest within 60 days of appointment. All of the three GIS documents listed December 29, 2021 as the “period covered.” December 29 is also listed as the actual date of the annual Multisys board meeting. The first GIS, filed in January 2022, was signed by Alex Erlito Fider, the corporate secretary of Multisys. The second, executed on October 27 2022, was signed by Faye Encarnacion Bautista, assistant corporate secretary of Multisys. Only a few days later, a third one, filed on November 18, 2022, was also signed by Bautista. Fider was still listed as the corporate secretary in the second and third filings. Section 9 of RA 6713, which concerns divestment of business interests by public officials states thus: “A public official or employee shall avoid conflicts of interest at all times. When a conflict of interest arises, he shall resign from his position in any private business enterprise within thirty (30) days from his assumption of office and/or divest himself of his shareholdings or interest within sixty (60) days from such assumption. The dates above indicate that Almirol was still listed as owner of over 49.21% of Multisys well after these deadlines required by law. The staggered updates also raise questions about the accuracy and timing of the company’s disclosures during his divestment period. After Almirol divested, as seen in the GIS filed by Multisys on November 18, 2022, Belen M. Al-Humayed took on a share percentage of 48.22%. A quick search shows that Al-Humayed is listed as owner of Bison Management Corporation, a licensed recruitment and placement company. Michael Toledo, the director for Government Relations & Public Affairs at Metro Pacific Investments Corporation, took a 1% stake. Meanwhile, PLDT’s stake grew to 50.68%. Incorporated in 2010, Almirol’s software development company Multisys made it to the headlines in 2020 when its app called Staysafe for the 2020 COVID-19 contact-tracing was flagged by critics as “borderline spyware.” The app was scrutinized for allegedly having intrusive and excessive app permissions. The firm’s listed clients include the Villar Group, Robinsons Bank, and Grab — among a claimed 2,000 others. It has also developed cashless payment apps for local governments like Manila and Cauayan City, as previously reported by Rappler. Responding to the criticisms then, Multisys would later remove the required permissions in January 2021 for GPS and Bluetooth. Multisys had a net income of P116.6 million and P42.7 million in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Majority of the revenues in these years were credited to “software licenses.” The company then incurred losses in 2022 and 2023. According to SEC financial statements in 2022, Multisys had net losses of P742 million. This continued in 2023 with net losses of P188 million. In 2024, Multisys finally rebounded with a net income of P209.5 million. As mentioned above, eGov-related PLDT contracts came starting November 2023. All eight contracts listed ePLDT as a co-contractor with PLDT itself or PLDT-owned subsidiaries, Vitro or Smart. In 2023 and 2024, the majority of the company’s revenues came from “managed services” followed by “system fees” and “software licenses.” Multisys explicitly states in its 2024 financial statement that it earned revenues from ePLDT in 2024 and 2023 for “managed services” totaling P514.6 million and P110.8 million, respectively. To date, the DICT procured “managed services” from ePLDT in 2024. In 2023 and 2024, Multisys also had other contracts with PLDT and Smart for consultancy and software development services. But these make up a smaller chunk of Multisys revenues, ranging from P0.04 million to P48 million. Prior to these ePLDT contracts in 2023 and 2024, the largest contract that Multisys had received from PLDT was a P158-million contract in 2021 with Smart for software development. Money had been flowing from PLDT to Multisys, but none matched the more than half-billion-peso contract (P514.6 million to be exact) that it received in 2024 for managed services. According to the ePLDT website, managed services refers to the “end-to-end support for technological infrastructure,” which includes services like cloud management and help desk support services. The DICT’s internal audit report said that while the “procurement has undergone the regular bids and awards process, the award of managed service contracts to ePLDT, given its ownership stake with Multisys, creates a strong perception of a revolving door.” Despite Almirol’s divestment, the audit suggests that the undersecretary’s past ties with Multisys, and by extension, PLDT, may give these companies an unfair advantage in terms of winning these multi-million government contracts. The audit said that the presence of these contracts “suggests that the officer is leveraging their public position to funnel government resources towards entities with which they have prior financial ties.” The audit added, “Even if no direct financial transactions occur, the goodwill generated or the strengthening of business networks through such decisions can be considered a form of personal gain.” Almirol, in an interview with Rappler, disputed the audit’s findings, claiming that other service providers of equal or similar size such as Globe and Converge have also received contracts comparable to PLDT’s. Publicly viewable eGov procurement contracts on the DICT website have not shown Globe or Converge data center deals, based on our review of the available contracts on the DICT procurement page found here. Almirol denied influencing procurement, saying he had “no control” over the bidding process. “I have no control over the biddings…there’s another [undersecretary] who handles biddings.” – with Victor Barreiro/Rappler.com",True,true,Conflict of interest?

"MANILA, Philippines – Construction company EEI Corporation acquired the firm which owns the defunct Philippine offshore gaming operator (POGO) hub Island Cove in Kawit, Cavite. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Thursday, October 16, the Yuchengco-backed firm said it acquired First Orient International Ventures Corporation (FOIVC) from KC Land Oriental Pacific Incorporated for P2.8 billion. EEI described FOIVC as a domestic corporation that acquires, develops, sells, and leases real estate properties. It currently owns and has rights over 49 hectares of land in Cavite, including the 30-hectare Island Cove property. EEI said it aims to diversify its portfolio through the acquisition. “The acquisition of FOIVC is part of the company’s long-term growth strategy to evolve from a pure-play construction company into a fully integrated property and infrastructure developer,” it said. Dubbed the country’s largest POGO hub, Island Cove shut down operations in November 2024 after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced a ban on POGOs during his State of the Nation Address that year. The property was once a resort owned by the Remulla family. According to Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla, their family sold the property to FOIVC in 2018. The company then repurposed it into a POGO hub in 2019. Leyte 1st District Representative Martin Romualdez also previously owned 20% of EEI in a 2023 deal with his family’s holding firm RYM Business Management. However, EEI chief executive officer Henry Antonio acquired the stake of the former House speaker through a management buyout in March.

"Filipino businessman and former politician Manny Villar didn’t help his own case when, in an earlier media interview, he waved off, unchallenged, the need for rigorous valuation models. “Just multiply 3,500 hectares times the value, you can get the price,” he said — spouting off a sort of pure-vibe, offhand arithmetic one expects from a casual cocktail-napkin scribble, not from a publicly listed conglomerate that presumes its scale grants it immunity from scrutiny – or a bar-side shorthand rather than disciplined corporate finance — revealing a confidence born less of rigor than of the belief that regulators will simply look away. Capital markets do not run on aspirational arithmetic. They run on discounted cash flows, zoning realities, infrastructure timelines, market absorption curves, and actual comparable sales. What Villar offered was not a valuation method. And in a year that demanded precision, that kind of elementary math was exactly the red flag regulators could no longer ignore. For more than a decade, the Villar Group embodied the Filipino aspirational narrative: a self-made billionaire building a sprawling empire of homes, malls, water utilities, supermarkets, and power assets, anchored by one of the fastest-growing property ecosystems in the country. Its founder, businessman Manuel “Manny” Bamba Villar Jr. previously served as senator from 2001 to 2013 and as the 25th President of the Senate of the Philippines from 2006 to 2008. His ascent to the summit of the country’s wealth rankings seemed inevitable, supported by a constellation of businesses that fed into one another with remarkable efficiency. Investors admired the group’s ability to scale. Regulators, for the most part, kept their distance. And the public regarded the Villar brand as omnipresent — sometimes controversially so, but undeniably powerful. In 2025, the Villar Group became the center of the most momentous corporate reckoning the Philippines has seen in decades. The catalyst was a single number — ₱1.33 trillion — the headline valuation assigned to newly acquired land inside Villar City. What was initially disclosed as a triumph of scale and vision quickly unraveled when auditor Punongbayan & Araullo refused to sign off on the fair-value adjustments, prompting the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to examine the appraisal methodology. E-Value, the firm responsible for the trillion-peso figure, was later sanctioned after investigators found that its valuation reports did not comply with International Valuation Standards. The result was the forced erasure of almost the entire revaluation gain, collapsing Villar Land’s unaudited asset size of ₱1.37 trillion to an audited figure of barely ₱35.7 billion. (READ: Villar Land’s paper empire unravels ) The impact was immediate and brutal. Villar Land’s stock plummeted by more than 80%, vaporizing an estimated US$18 billion in paper wealth and knocking off Manny Villar from the top of the country’s billionaire rankings. A company once positioned as the next major Philippine property heavyweight had to confront a new identity: the most prominent valuation cautionary tale in recent memory. (READ: Manny Villar is now Philippines’ richest) Yet the valuation debacle was only one fault line in a year defined by unraveling reputational capital. PrimeWater, for so long the quiet cash engine of the Villar empire, entered the spotlight for the wrong reasons. Its aggressive joint ventures with water districts — once heralded as a template for private-sector participation — attracted growing scrutiny from lawmakers, regulators, and local stakeholders who questioned service quality, tariff changes, and contractual fairness. Profitability remained strong, rising from ₱196 million in 2017 to nearly ₱1.8 billion in 2023, but profitability alone could no longer insulate the company from intensifying political and social pressure. By mid-2025, several water districts were openly seeking contract reviews or termination, and the administration signaled a willingness to revisit long-standing arrangements that had previously been considered untouchable. In the power sector, the narrative darkened further. SIPCOR — another Villar-controlled utility — lost its permit to operate in Siquijor after the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) determined that it had failed to deliver on mandated service improvements. The decision was administratively symbolic. For the first time, the state took the extraordinary step of revoking a Villar asset’s operating authority, sending a message that even the most politically connected conglomerates must meet regulatory performance standards. Investors saw it as confirmation that the era of passive oversight was over. Even the group’s retail arm, AllDay Marts, is melting, feeling the weight of the shifting tide. Once marketed as the Villar Group’s modern retail champion, AllDay suffered a revenue decline to ₱9.25 billion and a drop in net income to ₱268 million. The market reacted quickly. The stock, which debuted at ₱0.60 during the 2021 initial public offering (IPO) hype, now trades at a fraction of that price, with its market capitalization shrinking by roughly 70% from its peak. (READ: Leadership shakeup in Villar’s AllDay, AllHome as chiefs step down) In isolation, AllDay’s performance might be attributed to industry competition or post-pandemic normalization. But in the context of Villar Land’s valuation scandal and PrimeWater’s political exposure, the decline became part of a broader narrative: a conglomerate premium turning into a government discount. What makes the Villar story uniquely instructive is that its decline was not triggered by external shocks or macroeconomic collapse. It was driven by internal ascendancy tensions colliding with a regulatory environment newly determined to assert authority. For years, the Villar Group benefited from tightly integrated business units and political fluency. The model worked — until auditors, regulators, and investors demanded greater transparency, and the group’s interlocking structure suddenly magnified risk instead of dispersing it. The data tells the story of a spectacular inversion. A conglomerate that once enjoyed a reputation score of 9 out of 10 among institutional watchers witnessed the score fall to a mere 3 out of 10 by 2025. Risk indicators that hovered at low, stable levels a few years ago climbed sharply as controversies accumulated: PrimeWater’s joint venture agreement (JVA) disputes, SIPCOR’s service failures, Villar Land’s accounting restatement, and the sudden collapse of investor confidence. The market-cap curve for both Villar Land and AllDay illustrates the scale of the reputational correction. What was once a symbol of unchecked expansion became a case study in regulatory assertiveness. For global investors assessing Philippine markets, this year’s Villar saga is far more significant than one family’s financial turbulence. It is a vivid demonstration that Philippine regulators are beginning to bare genuine teeth — and that the country’s capital markets may finally be entering a phase where valuation discipline, service performance, and accounting integrity matter as much as political access. (READ: The rise of Cynthia Villar: How politics, money, networks made her No. 1) The irony is striking: the Villar Group’s fall from its once-untouchable position may end up strengthening the Philippines’ investment narrative rather than weakening it. By asserting control over valuation practices, utility performance, and public accountability, regulators have signaled a shift toward more credible market oversight. And conglomerates with weak governance structures are now on notice. In the end, the year that humbled the Villar Group may be remembered not simply as the story of a billionaire empire under pressure, but as a defining moment when Philippine institutions began to rebalance the scales between influence and accountability. The empire is far from collapsing, but the mythology surrounding it has. What remains is a conglomerate forced into transparency, a regulatory system emboldened, and a market newly awakened to the cost of governance risk. The coming year will be pivotal for the Villar conglomerate, and investors are already parsing the signals that will determine whether the group begins to recover or continues to weather the consequences of its own excesses. Foremost is the need for Villar Land to finally deliver a fully normalized balance sheet — one built on audited numbers, transparent related-party disclosures, and valuation practices grounded in conservative, defensible methodologies. Until the company sheds the ghost of its trillion-peso appraisal debacle, the market will remain reluctant to re-rate the stock. Just as crucial is the fate of PrimeWater, where quiet but persistent reports of talks with the MVP group, the Philippine-based conglomerate led by Manny V. Pangilinan, could lead to an asset sale or a joint operating platform. Such a move could help reduce the Villar conglomerate’s political and regulatory exposure, but only if the structure of the deal confronts the thornier realities of liabilities, service obligations, and the consumer-protection issues that have dogged the utility across multiple provinces. Any attempt to offload risk without addressing these fundamentals will only prolong the reputational drag. A third test lies in the operational turnaround of AllDay and whatever successor entities emerge from the remains of SIPCOR’s revoked franchise. Margin stabilization in retail and credible improvements in power and water service delivery would signal that the group is capable not merely of defending its empire, but of rebuilding it through performance rather than proximity to power. Success here would help shift the narrative away from governance failures toward genuine reform. For now, the Villar saga stands as a stark reminder that even the country’s most entrenched commercial empires can be repriced overnight, and that in emerging markets, reputation is not an abstract concept, but a balance-sheet item waiting to be marked to market the moment regulators decide the math no longer adds up. The Villar story reminds us of the dangers of overconfidence and recklessness. The empire’s plight mirrors the story of Icarus, a figure in Greek mythology, famous for his death when he flew too close to the sun using the wings his father Daedalus made from feathers and wax. It may very well be the best business story of the year. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] The Villar empire: From untouchable to a governance test case,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-manny-villar-empire-governance-test-case/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – With his choice of an undisclosed third party country in dispute, former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte has also explored the option of being temporarily freed in the Netherlands, the host country of the International Criminal Court (ICC) where he is currently detained. “Given the Prosecution’s non-opposition to interim release to the Netherlands, Mr Duterte respectfully requests that the Pre-Trial Chamber order the Registry to invite the Netherlands to make its observations on the possibility of accommodating Mr Duterte for the term of his interim release,” said Duterte’s lead defense lawyer Nicholas Kaufman in a filing made on June 16, but publicized only on September 10. Duterte said that if the ICC pre-trial chamber approves an interim release to the Netherlands, he “would not seek asylum in the Netherlands at any future date.” Duterte has been detained at the ICC detention center in The Hague since his sensational arrest in Manila on March 11. He was flown out of a government-chartered private plane on the same day of his arrest, sanctioned by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. who said this was in keeping with the country’s commitment to the Interpol which issued the red notice following an ICC warrant. Duterte filed for an interim release request on June 12, saying that an undisclosed third party country has already agreed to enforce possible conditions that may be set by the court. But the prosecution “strongly opposed” the release to that country. So on June 16, anticipating the opposition from the prosecution, Kaufman filed the request to ask the Netherlands to comment whether it would be willing to enforce the conditions for a possible interim release to the country. Kaufman said the advance request is separate from its main request for a release to their chosen country. Kaufman said in advance that should the Netherlands agree, Duterte would still “seek another State to which he could be released once released into Dutch territory, conditional upon authorization by the Pre-Trial Chamber.” The ICC pre-trial chamber asked the Netherlands to comment on June 18, and a copy of the order was published on September 23. In that order, the chamber also asked Duterte’s choice country to also comment. “The Defense would cover any costs expended by the Host State in enforcing the terms and conditions ordered by the Pre-Trial Chamber,” said Kaufman. In their opposition filed on June 23, the prosecution said it will not agree to Duterte’s chosen country because it “does not have the same extensive history of cooperation with the Court.” Some conditions that may be set out, which Duterte has offered to follow, would be to “refrain from public engagement, office, or communications with persons outside his family” and also to “abstain from use of the internet or any electronic devices, such as a mobile phone.” Duterte has reiterated this request for an interim release, after the defense obtained a medical report from its own chosen expert that the former strongman is allegedly suffering from “deteriorating cognitive condition” and thus is physically unable to do the risk factors like intimidating witnesses and committing more crimes. Under ICC rules, if those risk factors are present, a suspect cannot be temporarily released. This new detail offers an insight as to why Kaufman was mad at Harry Roque, Duterte’s former presidential spokesperson, who suggested suing the Netherlands for being an alleged accessory to the crime they call as kidnapping Duterte. The ICC pre-trial chamber has postponed what was supposed to be the confirmation of charges hearing on September 23, pending its own determination on Duterte’s fitness to attend the hearing. It has not announced the new date. – Rappler.com",True,true,Duterte exploring option to be released to the Netherlands,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/rodrigo-duterte-explores-option-release-netherlands/,Rappler

"BANGKOK, Thailand – Before it became one of Thailand’s most beloved public parks, Rotfai Park was once a golf course. That’s hard to imagine now, with the trees grown tall and the green grass open to all. There are no golf carts here; the air hummed with bicycles and chatter. Families picnic by the grove under the shade, runners pound the paved paths, and food vendors set up their tents near the entrance for the weekend market. For the locals, it’s an ordinary Saturday. But as a visitor, I couldn’t help the ache of longing and envy. Back home, we’d have called all this private property — which brings us to Intramuros. This story used to end with a frustrated question — why can’t we have open spaces? Intramuros was one of the clearest reasons it felt impossible. A vast expanse of green in the heart of Manila, that, for more than a century, has largely been reserved for a narrow pool of people. The argument often goes that it has always been this way, and heritage dictates that we have to uphold this privileged access. But something has changed. Since November 23, the Club Intramuros Golf Course has been opening its greens every Sunday as a public recreational space, with golf pausing for the day. It’s a start. A cautious one, yes, with boundaries still in place, as if the grass might be ruined by ordinary feet. But the direction is there. Is it enough? Hardly. Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso has been blunt about what he wants next: converting the site into the Intramuros Forest Park, a long-term project he frames as inclusive and sustainable, on the argument that the land is underutilized and benefits only a few. “Recently, may mga nagwawalang golfer. Akala mo ba sila ang may-ari at karapatan. Nanggalaiti sila na bakit daw gagawing park? Tingnan n’yo ang argument. Talagang mahahalata mo na mga taong makasarili,” Moreno said on December 3 as reported by Manila Bulletin. (Recently, there have been some angry golfers. You’d think they owned the rights to the land. They’re angry at it being turned into a park? Look at their argument. You can really tell they’re selfish people.) Moreno will face an uphill battle prying Intraumuros away. And to be fair, the pushback isn’t only emotional. There are real concerns about jobs and tourism revenue if the golf course is converted. But it’s not like the land will vanish; it will be repurposed. A forest park conversion can be done in phases, with Sunday openings serving as a test run rather than a token gesture. If anything, the fact that Intramuros can already open one day a week proves the point: the city can share this space. Beyond Intramuros, think of Wack Wack, Veterans, Villamor, Manila Golf, and more. It’s not that the metro lacks green space, or that every “park” is really just a concrete slab with tufts of dried grass. Though, to be fair, the few parks we do have fit that description. No — the land exists. In fact, we have dozens upon dozens of hectares kept green for the same purpose. So why do we keep reserving it for the few? Now, back to Thailand, so you can see what this looks like when a city commits to the idea fully. Bangkok’s Wachirabenchathat Park, popularly known as Suan Rotfai, shows what could happen if we chose differently. Rotfai Park wasn’t always open to the public. The land once belonged to the State Railway of Thailand and served as its private golf course. In 2002, the government decided to turn it into a public park and renamed it as Wachirabenchathat Park in honor of then-Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn’s 50th birthday. It was a symbolic gesture, opening up the exclusive green as a shared space. Much of the park’s layout still hints at its past, with wide fairway-like lawns now repurposed into jogging and cycling paths. In fact, the name Suan Rotfai literally means “Train Park.” We start at the weekend market by the entrance, a field of white and blue tents. Vendors sell everything from mango sticky rice to grilled chicken and some of the best salmon katsu I’ve tasted. Though the market is nowhere as big as nearby Chatuchak, it’s still lively, laid out in neat rows, and easy to navigate. In fact, it feels like a bigger, better-organized version of the Salcedo or Legazpi weekend markets back home. Despite being so wildly popular, both are pretty much confined to a narrow stretch of road and a parking lot. But that shows Filipinos have the appetite for that kind of gathering; if we built better, greener community spaces, weekend markets of this scale would surely follow. Before you enter the park, you also have the option to rent a bike, and you’ll definitely need one if you hope to see every part of the enormous 60-hectare property. How big is big anyway? Well, Rotfai Park is more than 200 times the size of Arroceros Forest Park, Manila’s so-called “last lung.” Once you step inside Rotfai Park, you’ll find that there’s more than enough room for everyone. Cyclists glide through the biking lanes, safely apart from joggers who keep to their own separate path. Couples sit on benches. Families nap on picnic mats. There are basketball courts, beach volleyball areas, tennis courts, football fields, and even a fitness center. If team sports aren’t your thing, there’s plenty of outdoor gym equipment and a big playground, where children chase each other and the elderly work up a light sweat. There’s space not just for people but for nature too. Wooded areas have enough trees to almost feel like small forests. Ravens squawk overhead and idle by the streams, ponds, and creeks that cut through the park. If you’re lucky – or perhaps, unlucky – you might even catch a monitor lizard sunbathing by the water’s edge. Rotfai Park is actually part of a larger complex of interconnected parks, including the Queen Sirikit Park next door. Though smaller than Rotfai, it lives up to its regal name. The entrance from within Rotfai hides itself like a well-kept secret: a narrow bridge shrouded by foliage that suddenly opens into promenades lined with flowers. Fountains ripple in the distance, and pools of water cradle blooming lotus flowers. In some corners of the park, the creeks run quietly beneath the trees, and between the leaves you can see Bangkok’s skyline glittering in the distance. It’s easy to forget, but this refuge lies right in the center of one of Asia’s busiest economic centers. The air here is warm and heavy, but not uncomfortable. It smells faintly of earth and blossoms. People stroll quietly, their conversations soft and unhurried, lost in the open space. And what space it is. That, perhaps, is what people forget they need – room to breathe, to move, to simply exist. That, too, is what the Philippines keeps missing. So if Thailand could turn an old golf course into a park where anyone can walk, sit, or think, why can’t we? – Rappler.com",True,true,Bangkok turned a golf course into a park.

"MANILA, Philippines – Malacañang assured concerned Philippine business groups that the government’s anti-corruption campaign is in full swing, after 34 organizations described the flood control scandal as having “eroded public trust” which “now threatens our national security.” Presidential Communications Office (PCO) Undersecretary Claire Castro, in a Palace briefing on Monday, October 20, cited various actions taken by the government. These include the issuance of lookout bulletins for contractors and officials under investigation, as well as various requests for asset freeze orders. “Nararamdaman po ng Pangulo at ng administrasyon ang mga nararamdaman ng mga businessmen kaya po patuloy ang ginagawang pag-iimbestiga at patuloy ang pagpapabilis ng aksyon para po mapanagot ang dapat na mapanagot,” Castro said. (The President and his administration feel what the businessmen feel. That’s why we continue to investigate and expedite action steps to hold the guilty accountable.) Castro also called out those allegedly trying to discredit the ongoing investigation of the Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI). She said that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. understands the private sector’s desire for results, but assured the business community that the anti-corruption crackdown was ongoing. Malacañang’s statement comes after 34 business groups co-signed a resolution urging Marcos to urgently address the corruption surrounding flood control and other public works projects. The 34 signatories include the Philippines’ influential business groups such as the Makati Business Club, Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Management Association of the Philippines. “We have contributed to the national funds through taxes locally and nationally and have paid additional assessment of taxes… Yet trillions of pesos supplied and intended to protect our communities from disasters have been squandered through ghost projects, substandard work, and inflated contracts,” the groups said. The business organizations urged Marcos to bestow full legal authority and independence upon the ICI, prosecute all those responsible, implement institutional reforms and recover ill-gotten wealth, and provide regular updates to the public. “This is more than a financial loss – it is a fatal breach of public trust that leaves our people vulnerable and outraged,” they wrote.

"MANILA, Philippines – Inflation remained unchanged in October 2025 at 1.7% amid a slower uptick in food prices, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Wednesday, November 5. The latest figure also places the average inflation rate for 2025 at 1.7%, still below the government’s target range of 2% to 4%. According to National Statistician Dennis Mapa, inflation in food prices slowed to just 0.3% in October compared to 0.8% in September. This means food prices still increased but at a slower pace. Inflation of meat prices, particularly pork, began to slow at 9.8%, while vegetable inflation decreased to 16.6% from 19.4% in September. However, fish prices continued to climb, recording an inflation print of 11.7% from 10.9% the month before. Rice prices also continued to deflate (-17%) amid the ongoing rice import ban and increased local palay production. (READ: Gov’t to extend rice import ban until end of 2025) “So, ‘yung production natin mataas. Of course, ‘yung prices in the world market ay bumababa na rin. So, that actually affected in a good manner ‘yung ating presyo ng bigas dahil continuously bumaba na siya,” Mapa said. (So our [palay] production was high. Of course, prices in the world market are also going down. So that actually affected the local price of rice in a good way since it’s continuously going down.) Slower food inflation, however, was offset by a surge in the inflation of power rates. Mapa noted that electricity inflation nearly quadrupled to 4.1% from just 1.2% in September. This was most felt in Metro Manila, as electricity inflation surged to 16% from 10.6%. The capital region’s inflation print climbed to 2.9% in October from 2.7%. The Manila Electric Company earlier announced a rate hike of P0.2331 per kilowatt-hour in October’s billing as generation charges increased due to the depreciation of the Philippine peso. The peso dropped to a record low of P59.13 against the US dollar in late October. Meanwhile, inflation in regions outside Metro Manila continued to slow to 1.3% in October amid easing food inflation. Central Visayas recorded the fastest inflation rate at 2.6%, while the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao continued to log deflation at -1.3%. Negative inflation or deflation means prices of goods and services have dropped. Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said the country’s latest inflation print reflects the government’s measures to manage food supply and protect consumers from price volatility. “The steady headline inflation rate shows that our coordinated interventions are helping to maintain adequate supplies and keeping essential goods affordable. We remain vigilant in managing risks from weather disturbances, global market volatility, and other domestic factors that may affect prices in the coming months,” he wrote in a statement. DEPDev added that the Marcos administration is pursuing long-term reforms to enhance productivity and economic resilience through investments in agriculture, energy, and logistics. Balisacan described these as essential to protecting Filipinos’ purchasing power, which he hopes will translate into the creation of better jobs and sustained economic growth. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) also said that it expects inflation to remain generally benign. However, the monetary authority noted that its outlook for domestic economic growth is weaker amid tepid business confidence due to the flood control corruption scandal. “Indications of slowing demand also reflect lingering uncertainty from the external environment,” the BSP said. The PSA is set to report the country’s gross domestic product growth figures for the third quarter of 2025 on Friday, November 7. – Rappler.com",True,true,Inflation holds steady at 1.7% in October 2025 amid slower rise in food prices,https://www.rappler.com/business/inflation-rate-philippines-october-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — With the 2025 midterm elections coming, consumption of information about local candidates is critical more than ever. The information we consume not only influences our voting decisions, but also shapes the leadership that will govern the country in the years to come. Members of the #FactsFirstPH coalition, including Rappler, Pitik Bulag, Explained PH, and News5, stepped up to promote voter empowerment and accountability. From informative comics to edutainment videos, these organizations leverage social media to amplify the #AmbagNatin campaign, which aims to empower voters ahead of the elections. Artist collective Pitik Bulag uses editorial cartoons and comics as tools for advocating for press freedom and the fight for facts. The group hosted a comic strip competition in the public art chat room of the Rappler Communities app to amplify the #AmbagNatin campaign. Public art chat room member Timothy Andrei Milambiling won first place for his artwork that highlighted the challenge of fact-checking among voters and the crucial role of media literate individuals in combating disinformation. His artwork also underscored the importance of community engagement in making informed choices. Second and third best artworks came from chat room members Fiana and Cesar Camba, respectively. Fiana’s piece highlighted widespread election bribery, while Cesar emphasized the importance of voting wisely for a child’s future. Another standout entry by user jascribbler depicted how fake news continues to mislead Filipinos, while shedding light on the need for countermeasures to ensure a fair election environment. Explained PH supported the #AmbagNatin project by unpacking the rise of deepfake and AI-generated videos. This edutainment video explains what deepfake and AI-generated videos are, how to spot them, and why fact-checking is crucial before sharing content online, especially as elections approach. Explained PH also released a comic on trolls and overseas voting, advocating against fake news and promoting voter empowerment. An illustration by jascribbler encapsulates the misinformation spread by online trolls which intensifies during elections. It reminds voters to stay cautious and rely on credible sources. User JKR’s illustration highlights the voting power of overseas Filipinos despite being far from home. It also serves as a reminder for them to register for the upcoming elections and stay informed about new voting methods. Rappler provides a comprehensive summary of key details for the 2025 elections, including updates on overseas voting. For the first time, overseas Filipinos will have the option to vote online. As part of the #AmbagNatin campaign, News5 tackled election surveys, explaining their relevance and common misconceptions. Through this video, it clarified that while election survey results provide insights into voter preferences, they do not determine election outcomes. Political analyst Jean Franco highlighted that election surveys reflect the voices of voters and play a role in democracy. This video also emphasized that surveys should serve as a guide, but voters must still think critically in choosing their leaders. Rappler’s #AmBAGNatin challenge in Pasig City gives voters a platform to share their views on candidates and key election issues. Participants draw questions from a bayong and share their thoughts on leadership and governance. The challenge also allows Pasig City residents to discuss how voters can contribute (ambag) to building a better future for the city’s youth. — Zebedee Custodio-Lucas/Rappler.com Zebedee Custodio-Lucas is a Rappler volunteer of MovePH.

"MANILA, Philippines – In a population of 116.6 million, only 28% of Filipinos hold a life insurance policy in 2025. The industry penetration remains stuck at 1.7% of GDP, one of the lowest among the countries in Southeast Asia, according to data from analytics firm Inquiro. The newly released PURPLE Report, commissioned by EastWest Ageas Insurance, also showed that the average Filipino has only set aside P50,000 for emergencies, which is barely enough to cover a routine medical procedure, let alone a major illness like ischemic heart disease — the country’s top cause of death — where treatment can cost P690,000. This readiness gap is not just financial. It is structural, cultural, and educational. It is also deeply personal. New analytics from Inquiro’s MarketScan dataset reveal that while the digital shift toward insurance is real, it remains uneven across the country. Among the 5.2 million Filipinos tracked for app-based insurance activity, adults aged 29-37 and middle-aged adults aged 38-51 emerge as the most frequent users. During the annual December surge, when many conduct financial checkups and sign up for new policies, middle-aged adults alone make up 36% of all high-frequency users. Urban areas continue to dominate adoption, with the National Capital Region (NCR), Cebu, Baguio/Benguet, and Davao City showing the strongest digital footprint. Meanwhile, several municipalities, particularly in remote parts of Mindanao and Tawi-Tawi, recorded zero insurance app usage as of May 2025. The numbers paint a clear picture: interest is rising, but the gaps are stark. While the figures can be discouraging, Sjoerd Smeets, president and CEO of EastWest Ageas Insurance, thinks it can also be seen as an opportunity. “The Philippine market has tremendous potential,” he told Rappler. “It’s young, digitally connected, and increasingly aware of the importance of financial security.” Smeets cited the top three challenges facing the Philippine insurance market: 1. The protection gap and affordability Many Filipinos underestimate the financial impact of illness or accidents, and products often feel out of reach. But several insurers now offer a wide portfolio, such as the P22-per-day entry-level term plans of EastWest Ageas for comprehensive critical illness and investment-linked solutions. 2. Low financial literacy Insurance documents can feel intimidating. So insurers need to respond to this challenge by offering plain-language materials, advice-led sales, and highly accessible educational campaigns on social media. 3. Digital trust and service speed Customers expect seamless, secure experiences. To meet this, insurers can offer self-service options, and even use generative AI to help advisors explain complex products and underwriting questions instantly and clearly. Smeets believes insurers must simplify, educate, and localize, while policymakers should enable digital onboarding and inclusion. “Insurance isn’t just for the wealthy,” he stressed. “It’s for anyone who loves someone and wants to protect them.” According to Smeets, the PURPLE Report’s findings are sobering. Inflation and unstable incomes further widen the readiness gap, especially among those aged 22 to 39. Yet even amid these challenges, resilience persists, with many Filipinos relying on family support and personal resourcefulness to get by. Smeets believes this is precisely why insurance must evolve and be communicated in a more human, relatable way. He also shares a simple lesson from his childhood: saving begins with discipline, not income. For young Filipinos, he recommends starting with an emergency fund and then securing essential layers of protection, beginning with health coverage, followed by accident insurance and income protection for breadwinners. As income increases, these foundations can grow into long-term savings and legacy planning. “Insurance isn’t about fear,” Smeets said. “It’s about care — caring for yourself and the people who matter most.” “Every Filipino deserves security,” he added. For millions of uninsured Filipinos balancing aspirations with daily responsibilities, he hopes that readiness to any life circumstances becomes not a privilege, but a possibility. – Rappler.com",True,true,"The P50,000 problem: Why most Filipinos remain uninsured",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/why-most-filipinos-remain-uninsured/,Rappler
"Gold and silver are on a tear — breaking records and defying gravity. Gold has soared past $4,100 an ounce, while silver has rocketed to more than $52, its first record in nearly half a century. The surge is but a reflection of global anxiety, as trade tensions between the United States and China flare anew. Now, investors are flocking to the oldest safe havens known to man. The rally is precipitated by a new chill between Washington and Beijing. Fresh tariff threats, tighter export controls, and brewing disputes over rare earth minerals have revived fears of another trade war. These are not minor skirmishes — port fees, sanctions, and supply-chain disruptions are once again reshaping global trade flows. Every time rhetoric hardens, investors run for cover — and the first shelter they find is in precious metals. Here are the key drivers: Trade war rhetoric has escalated again, with the US signaling tougher tariff and export control postures on China, especially in high-tech and rare earths. Investors, fearing supply chains shocks and global growth disruption, have bid up precious metals. The more the market anticipates that the Federal Reserve will shift toward looser policy (lower rates), the more attractive “non-yielding” assets like gold become (since their opportunity cost falls). The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) holds ~130 tons of gold (Q2 2025), up from ~127.5t in Q1. When global prices jump, the peso value of these reserves rises, improving the BSP’s balance sheet and the country’s perceived external buffer. But that’s a valuation gain, not spendable cash — helpful for confidence and reserve adequacy, but it doesn’t directly fund the budget. Why it matters: 1. Stronger reserve position A stronger reserve position can stabilize foreign exchange (FX) expectations during risk-off episodes tied to US-China flare-ups and precious-metals volatility. If the rally reverses, those gains can evaporate just as fast; the BSP treats this prudently. 2. Tailwinds for domestic gold mining (jobs, taxes, LGU shares) High gold prices improve margins for producing mines (e.g. OceanaGold’s Didipio; Philex’s Padcal with gold in copper concentrates). Their latest disclosures highlight robust free cash flow and ongoing reserve life, which high prices further support. More cash flow → more royalties, taxes, community shares, and potential capex. Small-scale miners benefit too. Since the promulgation of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act 11256, gold sold by registered small-scale miners to the BSP is tax-exempt and the BSP pays ~99.5% of the preliminary assay value — encouraging formalization and local sales. With record world prices, incentives to sell to BSP strengthen, pulling production into the legal channel and boosting rural incomes. Macro effect: More formal gold sales lift rural cash flows, raise Local Government Unit (LGU) royalty shares, and can modestly improve the current account if exports increase. It also deepens the BSP’s domestic bullion pipeline — strategically useful in volatile times. 3. Silver’s boom is a mixed bag for industry Unlike gold, silver is a critical industrial input (electronics, solar, electric vehicles). The present run — fueled by tight London inventories, elevated lease rates, and strong investment/Indian festive demand — pushes up component costs and squeezes manufacturers’ working capital. The squeeze has been severe enough to trigger air shipments and premiums over futures in London. For a country where electronics dominate exports, pricier silver can raise input costs for local assemblers/electronics manufacturing services (EMS) firms. Macro effect: In the short run, higher input costs can pressure margins and delay orders. Over time, exporters try to pass on costs to buyers; success depends on contract structures and global demand. With the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showing electronics as the linchpin of exports, sustained silver tightness is a mild headwind. 4. Jewelry, pawnshops, and household balance sheets Retail jewelry prices rise when bullion does. That hurts discretionary jewelry demand but raises collateral values for households which use jewelry for short-term liquidity via pawnshops. In a high-price regime, loan-to-value amounts improve — useful during income squeezes — though ticket sizes and interest terms still dominate outcomes. (Industry commentary has highlighted Filipinos’ inflation hedging instincts with gold.) Inflation channel: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) weight of jewelry is small, so direct CPI impact is muted. Indirect effects — via electronics and imported durables using silver — are more relevant but typically gradual. 5. Financial markets and the peso Gold up, silver squeezed, and US–China tensions typically tighten global risk appetite. That can support local miners’ equities on earnings upgrades, but broad equities might face risk-off flows if global growth fears resurface. For foreign exchange (FX), outcomes are path-dependent: if safe-haven dollar strength outweighs gold’s reserve optics, USD/PHP can still drift weaker; if the Fed easing narrative dominates, emerging markets (EM) FX (including PHP) can stabilize. Key swing factor: The Fed path: If real yields fall on dovish guidance, gold remains underpinned and global financial conditions ease — a friendlier setup for the peso and risk assets; a hawkish surprise would do the opposite. (Global coverage flags that 2025’s “gold mania” is already stretching beyond traditional drivers — raising reversal risk if the macro narrative turns.) BSP Gold Valuation (Sensitivity) Illustrative Mining Revenue Uplift (per quarter) Electronics Exporter: Silver Shock Sensitivity (Illustrative) Imagine that you have ₱1 million idling in the bank. The interest barely keeps up with inflation. You decide to divide it evenly: ₱500,000 in gold, ₱500,000 in silver. At today’s prices — ₱7,700 per gram of gold and about ₱70 per gram of silver — you acquire real, portable wealth. But what happens one year from now? Gold is trading near US$4,150 per ounce, up nearly 13% in the past month and over 50% year-on-year. Analysts like Bank of America now project $5,000 by 2026, driven by global uncertainty, central-bank buying, and fading confidence in fiat currencies. If this plays out, your ₱500,000 in gold could be worth roughly ₱600,000 — a 20% gain. Even in a moderate case (+12%), that’s ₱560,000, comfortably above inflation. The only major risks are a strong US dollar or stubbornly high interest rates that make yield-less metals less attractive. But gold rarely disappoints those who wait. It’s the “sleep-sound” asset — quiet, heavy, and timeless. If gold is the wise old sage, silver is its restless cousin — volatile, brilliant, and full of surprises. Currently priced at US $52 per ounce (₱3,030), silver has skyrocketed 67% in the past year. Industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles, and battery production keeps driving it higher. Should it reach $65 per ounce by 2026, your ₱500,000 stake would climb to ₱625,000 — a 25% jump. A moderate 15% rise still nets you ₱575,000. The metal’s volatility can cut both ways, but its long-term fundamentals are silver-solid. In a balanced portfolio, the metals complement each other — gold steadies, silver sprints. Here’s how your ₱1 million could look in a year: Even in the middle case, you outperform most local investments and bank deposits several times over. Gold and silver move not only with charts and central-bank cues, but with emotion — fear, hope, distrust, and belief. When governments wobble, investors instinctively run to the metals that never lie. Every peso you park in bullion is a quiet protest against uncertainty, a hedge against the manipulations of paper wealth. If you invest today, your story will not be about chasing speculative highs — it will be about preserving value while the world experiments with digital currencies, debt ceilings, and geopolitical gambles. A year from now, whether gold hits $5,000 or silver flirts with $65, you’ll hold something heavier than paper: peace of mind. Because when markets burn, the metals don’t melt—they shine. – Rappler.com Sources: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Bureau of Internal Revenue, Philippine Statistics Authority, Reuters, The Economic Times, Bloomberg, AP News",True,true,[Vantage Point] Gold and silver’s record-breaking run: A boom built on fear,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-gold-silver-price-surge-analysis/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — Tourism is no longer just about enticing travelers to visit the country, but to encourage them to keep coming back for different high-quality experiences. A recent study titled Capturing High-Quality Tourism in Southeast Asia by Oxford Economics (OE), in collaboration with the Asia Pacific International Spirits and Wines Alliance (APISWA) and the Alcoholic Beverages Alliance of the Philippines Inc. (ABAPI), shared key insights on how to maximize tourism opportunities in the region and in the Philippines. Across the board, they all agreed that 2026 is the perfect time to capitalize on travel opportunities, with the tourism sector steadily recovering from the pandemic. In January to August 2024, arrivals to the country reached 65% of pre-pandemic arrivals. But what part of travel should be prioritized? According to the study, it’s the food and beverage (F&B) experiences. The report surveyed 1,800 travelers from the region’s five major tourist source markets — China, South Korea, Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom — to understand traveler destination choices. And from these insights, it was revealed that the availability of quality F&B is valued over historical and cultural sights, especially for higher-income travelers. Tourists are willing to pay more when premium food and beverage experiences are offered. To be precise, that’s around US$250 per person per day. “Premium” does not necessarily equal luxury or gourmet, at least in the context of the study. According to James Lambert, director of economic consulting at Oxford Economics, “premium” in their analysis means high-quality food and beverage products. On one hand, quality could mean serving dishes from award-winning chefs and offering a full range of international, branded alcoholic beverages. But it is also about having a wide variety of options that are easy to access. “That might mean opening early, closing late, [and being] easy to get to,” Lambert said. Apart from the quality of the food, quality of service is also a major factor. “[The premium traveler is] willing to grab a burger from a robot at a casual eatery, but he would not want his 25-year-old scotch to be served by a robot in a Michelin star restaurant,” said a respondent from the study, highlighting the importance of the staff and service of premium F&B. However, while they are willing to pay more for better quality, tourists across different income groups still demand value for their money. Safety and reliability also remain crucial aspects in F&B. The report also notes that premium F&B means different things to different travel groups. Notably, it revealed that tourists from China valued access to F&B, while tourists from Korea and the UK are willing to spend more on exceptional service. How exactly can the industry use this data to drive tourism? According to Lambert, apart from embracing high-quality premium experiences, offering variety is also a key factor in developing F&B experiences. During the panel discussion of the report’s launch, Ramon Alampay, associate professor of the University of the Philippines Institute of Tourism, also emphasized catering to domestic tourists who make up the bulk of tourism in the Philippines. He said that there is a need to provide tourists with more awareness of the local food scene, where to go, and the quality of experience they can expect. An emerging strategy from the industry is promoting this on social media and online sites that travelers seek information from. Meanwhile, Chef Jessie Sinciocio, president and CEO of Chef Jessie Restaurants, shared that the strengths of Filipino F&B are rooted in its novelty. “I believe our food can compete with the best in the world, as long as they are prepared properly,” she said. This comes at a prime time, when the Michelin Guide announced its first-ever selection of Philippine restaurants in its 125-year history. However, one concern is that local producers and suppliers fail to offer consistent quality. For Chef Jessie, the problem lies in the logistics of delivering quality ingredients, a key issue to be addressed in improving local F&B. Ultimately, Alampay believes the data from the report can lead to innovations within the industry that explore new ways of experiencing culture through food. “You also want to have that level of innovation at the regional level. Whether it’s Ilonggo, Kapampangan, Bicol,” he said. Apart from building competitive destinations that offer quality F&B, he emphasized the need for proper training when it comes to offering a Filipino brand of service excellence. — Alyana Fabella/Rappler.com Alyana Fabella is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the Ateneo de Manila University.",True,true,"‘Premium’ food experiences are key to tourism growth, study reveals",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/oxford-economics-study-premium-food-experiences-tourism-growth/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Baguio City moved one step closer to getting a world-class transport terminal that aims to alleviate congestion and traffic in the Philippines’ summer capital. Megawide Construction Corporation (Megawide) disclosed to the Philippine Stock Exchange that it received last Friday, October 17, the notice of award for the P1.2 billion Baguio City Integrated Terminal (BCIT) Project that it will put up along Marcos Highway. The BCIT will cater to provincial buses coming from outside Baguio and will serve as a passenger transfer terminal to other modes of transportation going to the city. It will have loading and unloading bays for the provincial and in-city transport, a passenger waiting area with commercial establishments, as well as public parking for park-and-ride. Its other features are: 24-hour safety and security systems, schedule information kiosks, ticket and customer service booths, baggage amenities, free wi-fi, toilets and lactation station, persons with disability-friendly facilities, according to a project description posted by the Baguio City Public Information Office (PIO) last year. In addition, the terminal will also have “high-quality facilities for transportation operators,” such as a “staging area for repair and cleaning, drivers’ lounge, and canteen and electronic vehicle charging,” the Baguio City PIO said. The BCIT seeks to make transfers to various points in and out of the city seamless, which will hopefully prompt people to shift to using public transport. It is designed to accommodate 25,000 passengers daily, both for daily commuters as well as for those from other provinces and cities. Megawide, the company behind the multi-awarded Mactan-Cebu International Airport and the Philippines’ first modern landport Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange or PITX, will build the project under a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with the Baguio City government. City Mayor Benjamin Magalong has long been pushing for the project. A post shared by Megawide (@officialmegawide) “Lahat ng mga buses, hindi na pupunta sa Baguio, ‘di na makakadagdag pa sa congestion. Doon na lahat ang mga pasahero, doon na sasakay, mas maayos, mas systematic, mas malinis. At ‘yung kanilang serbisyo doon, para kang pumasok sa isang airport terminal,” Magalong said in July 2024, after signing an initial agreement with Megawide. (All the buses won’t be going inside Baguio, they won’t be adding to the congestion. All the passengers will ride there. It’s more orderly, more systematic, cleaner. All the services will be there, it’s like you entered an airport terminal.) Magalong has opted for the PPP mode for infrastructure projects in a bid to eliminate corruption. As required under the government’s PPP rules, Megawide had to overcome a Swiss Challenge or comparative challenge from other potential builders. This was held last October 14, and Megawide hurdled it, leading to the award of the project. “Our vision of a First-World Philippines goes beyond building structures and critical facilities — we also need to connect the key districts across the country to promote commerce and accelerate economic activity. We are very thankful to our local government unit (LGU) partners for sharing our common goal and providing opportunities and platforms where socio-economic progress can thrive,” said engineer Edgar Saavedra, Megawide chairman and CEO. The BCIT will be under a 40-year lease agreement between the operator and the Baguio City government. The land for the project is under a usufruct agreement between the Department of Agriculture and Baguio City, Magalong previously said. The terminal intends to serve seven southbound routes from Baguio: to La Union, Pangasinan, Tarlac, Pampanga, Bulacan, Metro Manila, and Cavite via the South Luzon Integrated Terminal Exchange (SLITX). On September 23, a Megawide subsidiary signed a joint venture agreement with Carmona City, Cavite, for the development of the SLITX. This P800-million terminal will serve various destinations, from Baguio in the north and destinations in Visayas and Mindanao. It will have a capacity of 30,000 passengers. “The facility [SLITX] will connect to PITX and other in-city public terminals and will also have direct access to SLEX via new toll entry and exit to be built and completed before it commences operation. With abundant transport options and park-and-ride facilities, SLITX will allow passengers from the South to directly access the central business districts in Metro Manila as well as the Ninoy Aquino International Airport,” Megawide said. “Landports, such as our PITX, BCIT, and SLITX, as well as the ongoing Cavite BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) system, are part of the grand objective to provide the public with safe, secure, and efficient public transport while improving connectivity and enhancing mobility across key cities, initially in Luzon,” said Jaime Feliciano, head of Business Development at Megawide. – Rappler.com",True,true,Baguio City moves closer to having a world-class integrated transport terminal,https://www.rappler.com/business/megawide-bags-baguio-city-integrated-terminal/,Rappler
"NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – The steep drop in sugar millgate prices this milling season stems from over-importation that worsened under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., a labor group said on Wednesday, October 15. Wennie Sancho, secretary-general of the General Alliance of Workers Associations (GAWA), pointed out that Marcos, who has been in office for only three years, has already approved four controversial sugar import orders. Sugar Order No. 5, which allowed the importation of 300,000 metric tons in August 2022, became controversial when Marcos, also agriculture secretary, denied approving it, prompting the resignation of SRA Administrator Herminigildo Serafica and Board Member Roland Beltran. SO6 in early 2023 sought to import 440,000 MT but was blocked by Senator Risa Hontiveros, who called it “government-sponsored smuggling.” SO7 authorized 150,000 MT but was later shelved to protect local producers. Sancho said SO8, series of 2024-2025, allowed 425,000 MT of refined sugar that flooded the local market by mid-September, two weeks before the October 1 start of milling. “It’s blatant. The present administration is fond of importing sugar, sending the industry to its near death,” he said. The current sugar glut, estimated at 275,000 MT, has pushed prices down to about P2,200 per 50-kg bag, roughly P300 below the production cost of P2,500, Sancho added. Sancho called for a sugar summit to address the crisis, saying stakeholders must assess the industry’s condition and find ways to keep it afloat. Ten lawmakers from the Negros Island Region on Tuesday, October 14, called on the SRA to release data on sugar importation, pest infestation, and the shift in market demand from local to imported sugar. The group included Negros Occidental representatives Julio Ledesma IV, Alfredo Marañon III, Javier Miguel Benitez, Jeffrey Ferrer, Emilio Bernardino Yulo III, Mercedes Alvarez-Lansang, and Bacolod City’s Alfredo Abelardo Benitez, along with Negros Oriental Representatives Emmanuel Iway, Maisa Sagarbarria, and Janice Degamo. One of them, Javier Miguel Benitez, filed House Resolution No. 373, urging the House committees on agriculture, trade, and labor to investigate the sugar price problem. Former SRA administrator Rafael Coscolluela, an ex-governor, said earlier “there is too much supply of sugar at the wrong time,” faulting the SRA for failing to balance supply and demand. Aurelio Gerardo Valderrama Jr., president of the Confederation of Sugar Producers Incorporated (CONFED), also wrote an open letter to SRA Administrator Pablo Azcona questioning whether the implications of oversupply and artificial sweeteners were properly assessed before the latest imports. CONFED asked the SRA for its plan to stabilize prices, control oversupply, and regulate sweeteners that are displacing locally produced sugar. Azcona has said no additional sugar imports will be allowed until mid-2026. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Negros labor group hits Marcos, says sugar imports push industry to ‘near death’",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/visayas/general-alliance-workers-associations-negros-occidental-hits-marcos-jr-sugar-crisis/,Rappler
"Last week, Chinese-Filipino tycoon Lucio Co pulled a surprise by acquiring 100% of Manny Villar’s troubled PrimeWater Infrastructure Corporation, one of the Philippines’ largest water utility firms, covering 1.7 million households. The transaction surprised many since it had been reported weeks earlier that PrimeWater had been in talks with Maynilad parent firm, Metro Pacific Investments Corporation headed by Manny V. Pangilinan. No less than the Maynilad chairman had confirmed the talks, telling reporters in Hong Kong, “I think if it works for us, if it’s commercially feasible for the group, then obviously we will take a look at it more seriously.” (READ: What’s next for Maynilad after its stock market debut?) Lucio and wife Susan are well-known for being the couple behind the “grocery of the masses” — Puregold — which grew from a single store in Mandaluyong City in 1998 to 511 stores, as of December 2024, mostly in Luzon. Puregold Price Club Inc. is now the second largest Philippine retailer in terms of revenues, next to the Sy family’s SM Retail. While Puregold caters to the lower-income classes, the Cos also own the high-end S&R Membership Shopping Warehouse. The Co family bought this in 2006 and has steadily grown the retail chain that caters to the upper-income classes. From only six stores in 2011, there are now 29 S&R stores that sell mostly imported goods, largely from the US. They also own Office Warehouse, a retail chain that focuses on selling office and school items. The Cos’ other high-profile businesses that consumers may know are: These business ventures have largely made Lucio and Susan among the richest Filipinos on the Forbes’ World’s Billionaires list. But there’s one family business that’s not been widely mentioned as being part of Lucio Co’s business empire: his water utility business. Co owns Pamana Water Corporation, a water utility firm with around 15 branches in six provinces: Pangasinan, Tarlac, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Laguna, and Pagadian City in Zamboanga del Sur. Co’s publicly listed conglomerate Cosco Capital Incorporated lists the 71-year-old businessman as a member of the board of directors of Pamana Water. Pamana started in 2017 or eight years ago, promising its customers that it was “committed to be one of the best utility companies in the country by providing and maintaining clean, safe and adqquate water supply.” Mr. Co has chosen to play a visible role in Pamana’s biggest branch, in Dagupan City, Pangasinan. Pamana Water District Dagupan City recently posted a Facebook reel showing its “chairman Lucio Co” visiting the branch and even joining the employees and some customers in a boodle fight. It’s one of the rare public appearances of Co that’s accessible on the web. Pamana Water’s joint venture with Dagupan City dates back to 2020, and the utility firm claims to have expanded its service there from 27,677 concessioners in 2020 to 32,181 in 2025. It has laid out an additional 20,310 meters of pipes and increased its pumping stations from 18 to 24 over the five-year period. Pamana Water Dagupan City says Co’s visit reinforces the “high quality of service being provided to all customers and ensuring continued operational excellence.” Pamana Water’s joint venture with Dagupan City was inked on December 4, 2020, with Co himself present during the signing in his PBCOM Tower, one of the tallest commercial buildings in the Philippines. He has also graced joint venture agreement signings with other water districts, such as the one with Candaba Water District, Pampanga, in 2021 or during the COVID-19 pandemic. The anti-privatization group Water for the People Network (WPN), in a December 18 statement, says Pamana Water has 15 joint venture agreements in the provinces where they operate. It also criticized PrimeWater’s sale to Co’s Crystal Bridges, claiming Pamana Water hasn’t been a good partner for water districts, citing alleged “consumer complaints” in Nueva Ecija and Tarlac. “Pamana is no saint. Like PrimeWater, consumers have criticized Co’s firm for entering previously well-performing water districts, delivering low to no water in Nueva Ecija, and providing dirty or yellowish water in Tarlac, all while imposing rate hikes such as those seen in Pangasinan,” said WPN spokesperson Leo Espelimbergo. Pamana Water, however, has claimed to be the “preferred water provider” in areas in Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, as well as in Pangasinan, Pampanga, and Laguna. Like many Tsinoys, Co and his wife Susan are media-shy, with hardly any press interviews. He was even absent when his friend, then-Bacolod mayor Albee Benitez, conferred on Co the title of “adopted son and honorary mayor of Bacolod City in February 2024. Co’s daughter Camille Clarisse Co-Lao and her husband Michael Stephen Lao represented Co in the ceremony. (READ: Lucio Co’s takeover of PrimeWater ‘injustice’ for Bacolod consumers – watchdogs) “The title of Honorary Mayor serves as a distinguished recognition for individuals who have made exceptional contributions to the city’s economic growth and progress,” the city said, citing Co’s projects, such as the Bredco port facilities, Puregold, and the S&R Membership Shopping. Lucio Co will probably have to be more transparent and accessbile to the public after buying PrimeWater, what with the numerous complaints from consumers and lapses confirmed by regulators. As Rappler’s business columnist Val Villanueva says, when consumers’ trust is lost, the new owner must work hard to rebuild it, starting by being more transparent and open in its dealings.

"The economy is ending 2025 on an upswing driven again by holiday spending and strong Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) remittances but definitely with a slower-than-expected growth rate below the government’s target of 5.5% to 6.5%. S&P Global set it at 4.8% on the basis of the temporary reduction in public infrastructure spending, while private local economic institutions like UA&P and the World Bank are placing it at 5.1% and 5.3%, respectively. The general outlook for 2026 is more optimistic albeit cautious. Public spending is expected to accelerate while inflation is expected to stay low during the year and global conditions stabilize. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is seen to accelerate to around 6.2%. While estimates are still mixed with some analysts even predicting further weakness, the Philippine peso may maintain its parity with the US dollar in the high 50s but just below 60 following an expected rebound in government spending that could boost investor confidence and buttressed by the continuing heavy inflow of OFW remittances. Again, growth in 2026 is expected to be primarily driven by strong domestic consumption, bolstered by low inflation estimated at around 3% for 2026, rising employment, and strong remittance inflows from OFWs. This will result in volume of growth in the sector dealing in food, retail, and consumer staples. The financials, especially banking, are next. Continued economic expansion will fuel sustained credit demand from both corporate and consumer segments. Moreover, stable monetary policy and favorable interest rate conditions are expected to allow major banks to sustain strong earnings growth. Expected to also do well is infrastructure and construction. The government has committed to maintain high infrastructure spending, targeting 5% to 6% of GDP over the medium term. This sector is projected to register a significant annual growth rate, estimated at over 7% all the way through 2029 as big-ticket public-private partnership (PPP) projects, including railways, ports, and bridges, move forward. Then come the Real Estate Investment Trusts or REITs. The REIT sector benefits from stable cash flows generated by properties used for infrastructure and logistics. They will continue to provide attractive dividend yields to investors. Considering that there is a serious domestic shift in government policy toward sustainable and critical energy sources – in keeping with the global trend – the energy and renewable resources sector is also poised to become key investment growth areas for the year and onwards. The sector will be heavily supported by local investment facilitation boards. This will encourage companies focused on solar, wind, and geothermal power to expand rapidly to both meet the rising clean energy demand and need to transition away from fossil fuels. Mining and extraction may find traction at this time, too. Continued global demand for critical minerals and industrial metals is expected to increase and keep the mining and extraction sector robust, especially with government reforms aimed at boosting the industry. Finally, the services sector is also estimated to play a key role in catering to long-term global trends at the same time remain as the largest component of the economy, accounting for about 61.5% of GDP. Together with the entry of Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure, the Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing (IT-BPO) sector is expected to sustain growth, adapting to global demand trends, including those related to electronics and semiconductors. Global demand for AI-related electronic products is expected to boost merchandise trade, directly benefiting the Philippines’ substantial electronics assembly and export industry. First MetroSec’s head analyst Mark Angeles and assistant colleague Estella Dhel Villamiel, who were responsible for the production of the recommendations, premised their stockbrokerage house’s strategy and game plan referencing Robert Frost’s 1915 poem “The Road Not Taken.” Angeles and Villamiel see the market standing in some crossroads and is set to take what it calls as the familiar muddle-through path that is lined with caution spilling over into the next 12 months. For 2026, the index target range is placed between 5,500 to 7,500, with a base case of 6,500, driven by an earnings per share (EPS) growth of +5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) rather than by valuation expansion. Risk premium is assumed to remain elevated at 600bps, near +2SD above the technical historical mean of the market considering the lingering confidence concerns, in general. If the above explanation was confusing than enlightening, just remember that First MetroSec is estimating that the market may hit the high of 7,500 of the market’s main index (which is the Philippine Stock Exchange index or PSEi) or fall as low to 5,500 in 2026 but is confident to see it thread at 6,500 on the basis of an EPS growth estimate of +5% CAGR rather than by market valuation performance. What is important, according to Angeles, “much of the valuation damage is already priced in, which should limit downside risk.” Factors that could steer the market upwards include governance reforms and normalization of public spending, macro stability with GDP growth returning to trend, and renewed foreign fund inflows. Source: First Metro Securities, Refinitiv Closing price as of 27 November 2025 In summary, Angeles and Villamiel of First MetroSec reiterate their barbell strategy, wherein “One foot remains on the familiar road with dividend plays and defensives for cashflow/earnings visibility, while the other steps onto the road less travelled with large-cap cyclicals positioned for economic and confidence recovery.” Also, they advocate “an unmarked trail with AI diffusion as an emerging structural theme, favoring sectors with high operating leverage.” – Rappler.com (The article has been prepared for general circulation for the reading public and must not be construed as an offer, or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or financial instruments whether referred to herein or otherwise.

"MANILA, Philippines – Ayala Land Incorporated (ALI) is pushing to turn Laguna into the country’s next commercial business district (CBD). ALI is developing Metro Nuvali, a 200-hectare mixed-use development in Laguna. The upcoming CBD will be divided into three parts — with dedicated zones for shopping and leisure, commercial and cultural centres, and a civic complex that includes a satellite city hall — nestled in its 2,500-hectare estate. “We’re seeing entrepreneurs, we’re seeing professionals coming in, BPOs (business process outsourcing firms) continue to be interested. International schools are interested. They’re looking at opportunities to grow further down the south,” said Christopher Maglanoc, senior vice president (SVP) and group head of Ayala Land Estates. The shift in focus comes as reservation sales from Ayala Land’s core revenue driver — its premium segment composed of Ayala Land Premier and Alveo — posted a year-on-year decline. Based on ALI’s latest financial report, premium brands booked P20.3 billion in the third quarter of 2025, down 6.1% from the P21.6 billion in the same period in 2024. Ayala Land is now taking advantage of Nuvali’s growing community and the development of new infrastructure projects connecting Metro Manila to nearby provinces. “It’s a natural progression,” Maglanoc said. “We’re just capitalising on that.” Metro Nuvali’s three districts — Lakeside, Central, and Civic — will all be accessible via major roads and will be interconnected through parks, walkways, and a shuttle system serving the area. The first 70 hectares of the CBD may be what the public is familiar with, thanks to Ayala Malls Solenad. This forms part of the Lakeside District, which accounts for half or 100 hectares of Metro Nuvali. “We’re just building on it and enhancing it,” said May Rodriguez, vice president and senior estate development head of Ayala Land. The mall, which has since been renamed to Ayala Malls Nuvali, is getting an additional 50,000 square meters of leasable commercial space. It will house a total of 550 stores — among those expected to open by the second half of 2026 are Beyond the Box, Sketchers, Nike Rise, Wilson, The Matcha Tokyo, Sports Direct, and Foot Locker. It will soon have a two-storey food hall and new parking slots. This is all part of Ayala Land’s mall refresh, which the property giant has allocated around P17.5 billion for. Meanwhile, 60 hectares of Metro Nuvali will be allocated to its Civic District. This is where the 2-hectare Santa Rosa Civic Complex, a donation to the local government, will rise. This means that the CBD will house a satellite city hall, its own convention center, hotel, and command center. The Central District, spanning 40 hectares, will be allocated for office towers and workspaces. According to ALI officials, the company has already started selling commercial land within the project. “There are certain areas that we’re keeping for our own use, whether that be for the mall, for the hotels,” Maglanoc said. “We’ve identified all of these strategic locations.” Ayala Land did not provide a timeline for when Metro Nuvali will be completed. But the Civic District is a priority, with hopes to break ground on the Civic Complex by 2026 with the help of the local government of Santa Rosa. In 2024, Calabarzon contributed 14.7% to the country’s economy, ranking just second to Metro Manila. The region’s economy was valued at P3.27 trillion, thanks to industries such as manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and real estate. Ayala Land officials have noted how the Cavite-Laguna Expressway — the toll road linked to the South Luzon Expressway — helped Nuvali thrive to what it is today. Nuvali is also accessible to commuters, thanks to a point-to-point bus from One Ayala in Makati that also services travel to and from the eco-city on weekdays. And with the construction of the North-South Commuter Railway, which includes a stop at Santa Rosa, commuters will have more options in the future. However, ALI officials are hoping that with the development of Metro Nuvali, those in the area would no longer need to travel far for opportunities. “There’s a big build-up community in the South, so it’s natural for them to be able to say, ‘Why not put up my next business, the next office here in this area? Because this is where I live,” said Maglanoc. “The ideal situation is for them to have their business already here.” – Rappler.com",True,true,"Ayala Land bullish on expansion beyond metro, doubles down on Nuvali",https://www.rappler.com/business/ayala-land-bullish-expansion-metro-nuvali/,Rappler
"The two-tiered specific tax on Sweetened Beverages (SBs) was introduced through Republic Act No. 10963, or the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law, enacted in 2017 and implemented in January 2018. This policy led to higher prices for sweetened drinks, with a tax of P6 per liter for beverages using caloric and non-caloric sweeteners and P12 per liter for those containing high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The tax was introduced for two main reasons: (1) to raise government revenue and (2) to discourage the consumption of sugary drinks linked to obesity and higher risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). On September 30, 2025, House Bill No. 5003 was introduced to strengthen the effectiveness of the current sugar-sweetened beverages tax policy by updating the tax rates and expanding its coverage. The bill aims to further reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages and address the growing cases of NCDs, overweight, obesity, and undernutrition linked to dental caries, while also increasing government revenue to fund urgent health and nutrition programs. Under Section 150-B, an excise tax increase from P6 to P20 per liter of volume capacity shall be imposed, assessed, and collected on sweetened beverages using purely caloric sweeteners, purely non-caloric sweeteners, or a mix of the two. Sweetened beverages that use purely coconut sap sugar and purely steviol glycosides remain exempt from the tax. Meanwhile, beverages using purely high fructose corn syrup or any combination of HFCS with caloric or non-caloric sweeteners shall be subject to a higher tax rate, increased from P12 to P40 per liter of volume capacity. In addition, the new law will impose an excise tax of P6 per liter of volume capacity on all flavored milk, fermented milk, flavored non-dairy milk, and sweetened coffee products. Lastly, the newly created Section 150-C provides that the tax rates shall be automatically increased by six percent (6%) every year, effective January 1, 2026, if the bill is enacted. Under the proposed amendment, the allocation of revenues from the excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages has been revised. The portion allocated to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) for the implementation of the Universal Health Care Act of 2019 is reduced from 80% to 40%. Similarly, the share allotted nationwide for medical assistance, the Health Facilities Enhancement Program (HFEP), and other health-related needs managed by the Department of Health (DOH) is decreased from 20% to 10%, with allocations distributed by political and district subdivisions. The remaining 50% of the total revenue shall be allocated to the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) for distribution to provinces to support local health and nutrition programs. This 50% DILG share is further divided into two (2) portions; the 40% shall be used for nutrition-specific programs targeting children aged zero to five years, as well as pregnant and lactating women. While the remaining 10% shall fund nutrition-sensitive interventions, such as water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs, as determined by the DILG. This revised allocation aims to balance support for universal health care with a stronger focus on local nutrition and hygiene initiatives, ensuring that the health impacts of sugary drink consumption are addressed from both preventive and curative perspectives. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Ask the Tax Whiz] How do Filipinos benefit from a higher excise tax on sugary drinks?,https://www.rappler.com/business/ask-the-tax-whiz-how-filipinos-benefit-higher-excise-sugar-drinks/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Year-end tax compliance is often seen as a routine obligation, but for businesses and individual taxpayers, it plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate reporting, avoiding penalties, and minimizing audit risks. As 2025 ends, taxpayers are encouraged to review their records early and prepare for the key requirements due in the first quarter of 2026. Year-end compliance goes beyond simply filing tax returns. It involves reconciling income, expenses, payroll, and taxes withheld throughout the year to ensure that all figures are accurate and consistent. Addressing these tasks before year-end helps reduce the risk of penalties, prevents discrepancies that could trigger audits, and makes the preparation of annual income tax returns significantly smoother. Employers and taxpayers should pay close attention to annual payroll and withholding requirements, particularly the submission of alphalists and certificates to employees and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Employees must receive their BIR Form 2316, or Certificate of Compensation Payment and Tax Withheld, on or before January 31, 2026. Employers, meanwhile, are required to submit copies of Form 2316 to the BIR or their respective Revenue District Office by February 28, 2026. The BIR Form 1604-C, which summarizes taxes withheld on compensation along with the alphalist of employees, is due on January 31, 2026. For payments such as professional fees and rentals, these are generally subject to expanded withholding taxes (EWT) rather than final withholding tax (FWT), and should be reported through BIR Form 1604-F, also due January 31, 2026. Meanwhile, BIR Form 1604-E, covering creditable or expanded withholding taxes and accompanied by the alphalist of payees, is due on March 1, 2026. It is essential that payroll records, withholding tax returns, and alphalists are fully reconciled. Any mismatch between amounts reported and taxes actually remitted during the year may result in penalties or assessments. Properly maintained books of accounts remain a cornerstone of tax compliance. Whether manual, loose-leaf, or computerized, books must be complete and updated. These records support the figures declared in tax returns and help avoid issues should the BIR review or audit a taxpayer’s filings. Aside from payroll and books, businesses should prepare an annual inventory list, particularly if they hold stocks or merchandise, and reconcile it with their accounting records. Sales, purchases, and withholding schedules should be reviewed for accuracy, while supporting documents—such as receipts, invoices, and withholding certificates—should be properly organized and readily accessible. Payroll data, including 13th-month pay and other benefits, must also be verified against what was reported in Forms 2316 and 1604-C to ensure consistency across all filings. Tax compliance does not end with national taxes. Businesses are also required to renew local permits, pay local business taxes, and submit city or municipal reports, which are generally due in January 2026. Failing to meet these local requirements can result in penalties or delays in business operations. Completing year-end compliance tasks early lays the groundwork for accurate annual income tax returns. Calendar-year taxpayers typically file their annual returns and audited financial statements by April 15, 2026. Proper preparation minimizes last-minute stress, accounting adjustments, reduces errors, and lowers the risk of penalties or amendments. Taxpayers are advised to reconcile books, payroll records, and alphalists before the year ends. Keeping all supporting documents well-organized and easy to retrieve can save time during filing season. Seeking professional guidance can also help identify gaps or discrepancies early, allowing issues to be addressed before deadlines approach. In tax compliance, preparation is not just a best practice, it is a safeguard against unnecessary risks and costs. – Rappler.com ACG is the most trusted tax advisory firm in the Philippines, providing tax strategy, compliance, and policy advisory services to multinational corporations, foreign investors, and government institutions.

"MANILA, Philippines – In 2025, the Philippines faced its largest corruption scandal: the flood control and other public works controversies. Its impact has rippled through every corner of our country’s development, including our economy. With high-profile lawmakers and contractors tied to the issue, public trust, financial stability, and even international investor confidence have all been affected. All this is unfolding as GDP in the third quarter of 2025 rose by 4%, our weakest non-pandemic quarterly growth rate since 2011.

"MANILA, Philippines – Lopez-led ABS-CBN Corporation confirmed on Thursday, December 4, that it has received a notice from Manny Pangilinan’s TV5 Network terminating its content supply agreement due to money matters. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), the former broadcasting giant insisted that the dispute over the reported P1-billion delayed payments to the Kapatid channel was pending, and that it had sought more time to meet its obligations. ABS-CBN also denied it had “willfully delayed payment,” and asked for understanding given the loss of its lucrative broadcast franchise over five years ago under the Rodrigo Duterte administration. After it lost its broadcast franchise, ABS-CBN pivoted to being a content provider to its former competitors, including TV5 and later GMA Network, plus smaller entities such as Manny Villar’s ALLTV and Eddie Villanueva’s Zoe Broadcasting‘s A2Z that had franchises. It also signed content deals with streaming platforms such as Netflix and Viu, and consolidated its domestic and global streaming platform to iWant. ABS-CBN renewed its content agreement with TV5 in June 2023. Under the five-year deal, ABS-CBN would continue to supply TV5 with shows for its weekday and weekend primetime slots. Among the Kapamilya shows currently on primetime on TV5 are the popular Coco Martin-helmed Batang Quiapo teleserye, and new series Roja and What Lies Beneath. They are also shown on ABS-CBN’s digital platforms such as YouTube. Most ABS-CBN viewers shifted to YouTube and paid cable TV after the Kapamilya broadcast operations shut down. Majority of the poor who couldn’t afford digital services shifted to GMA’s and TV5’s free TV for entertainment and news. (READ: Fewer viewers, ad options: How ABS-CBN shutdown alters PH media landscape) As of Thursday, TV5 told Rappler that ABS-CBN shows will still be aired on the Kapatid channel. TV5 issued a statement late Thursday in response to ABS-CBN’s disclosure, noting that while “TV5 recognizes the value of ABS-CBN’s well-loved programs,” its failure to meet financial commitments “made it very difficult” for TV5 to compensate its employees and talents. “Our Content Agreement with ABS-CBN requires them to remit, on a timely basis, TV5’s share of revenues they collect from advertisers. These amounts collected, our share being held by ABS-CBN for TV5, has reached such material value as to severely affect TV5’s ability to settle its own obligations,” the TV5 statement said. “Despite our repeated appeals, ABS-CBN has failed to pay what is due. Neither have they given assurances, nor indicated, that they can or will.” Publicly listed ABS-CBN, in its statement, said: “…We deeply regret that this action has been taken at this critical juncture in our recovery, particularly as we continue to navigate the unprecedented challenges arising from our franchise loss.” “Contrary to media reports, the amounts and manner of the claims remain disputed. We acknowledge our obligations to TV5 and are doing everything we can to address these payments. We have sought additional time to resolve this matter and are working urgently within the thirty-day period we have been given. “While this timeline is challenging given our current circumstances, we are committed to finding a way to fulfill our obligations — not only to TV5 but to all our partners and stakeholders. We remain open to fair and reasonable solutions that recognize the extraordinary circumstances our company has faced. “There is no truth to any insinuation that ABS-CBN willfully delayed payment. Such characterizations fail to acknowledge the severe financial constraints imposed on us through circumstances beyond our control.” ABS-CBN noted that the loss of its broadcast franchise in May 2020 “significantly reduced its revenues” that it said “was not a matter of choice or mismanagment, but a direct result of regulatory action that stripped away our primary revenue source.” ABS-CBN recorded a net loss of P5.6 billion in 2021, P2.6 billion in 2022, P12.8 billion in 2023, and P6 billion in 2024. It had a net income of P1.9 billion in 2018 or before the COVID-19 pandemic and the broadcast shutdown in 2020. ABS-CBN reported a net loss of P1.6 billion for the first three quarters of 2025, 24% lower than the P2.1 billion net loss in the same period in 2024. Advertising revenue went up from P4.7 billion to P5.4 billion in the first 9 months of 2025, up P694 million or 15% due partly to election-related advertising in the 2025 mid-term polls. In February, the Lopezes decided to sell 30,000 square meters of its 44,027-square-meter property in Sgt. Esguerra, Quezon City to Ayala Land Incorporated for P6.2 billion to pay for its outstanding loans. “While some revenue streams have since recovered, ABS-CBN continues to operate at a loss as we work to rebuild,” ABS-CBN said in its statement. Aside from being a content provider, ABS-CBN shifted its focus to digital operations but the earnings from digital platforms are not enough to make up for the loss in broadcast revenues. “Despite these formidable challenges, our transformation into a storytelling company has shown steady performance improvement, demonstrating our resilience and commitment to our stakeholders. While we are still short of realizing a full turnaround, our trajectory is clear and our dedication unwavering,” ABS-CBN said. In a separate statement to its Kapamilya viewers on Thursday, ABS-CBN said in a social media post that it would find ways to reach them in the event the TV5 partnership is terminated.

"MANILA, Philippines – Vice President Sara Duterte’s Isang Kaibigan children’s book has become the topic of heated discussions and memes. The book surfaced at the Senate budget deliberations on the 2025 proposed budget of the Office of the Vice President (OVP) on Tuesday, August 20. Senator Risa Hontiveros questioned what the book that was allocated P10 million under the proposed budget was about, leading to Duterte accusing Hontiveros of politicizing the hearing in an intense exchange. Filipino netizens were quick to poke fun at the book, creating memes that referenced Duterte’s past controversies — like her punching a court sheriff in 2011 when she was Davao City mayor, and her recent personal trip to Germany during Typhoon Carina. But Isang Kaibigan has sparked a new conversation: whether its similarities to the 2009 children’s graphic novel Owly: Just a Little Blue by Andy Runton are just a coincidence. Isang Kaibigan takes on the theme of true friends who help you during tough times. It follows Kwago, an owl who loses his home and all his belongings to a storm. He is then kept company by one friend, Loro, a parrot who helps him rebuild his nest after the onslaught of the heavy rains. Meanwhile, Owly: Just a Little Blue follows best friends Owly and Wormy, who help a family of bluebirds living in a damaged tree build a new home. However, the family didn’t like it as much as Owly and Wormy would have hoped. When a storm comes, the two friends immediately remember the bluebirds and start working on helping them seek shelter from the rain. It’s the second book in Andy Runton’s graphic novel series Owly, which was first published in 2004. Owly: Just a Little Blue‘s original, black-and-white edition with no text was published in 2009. It was later republished in 2020 in full color, and with text. Just as there are observed similarities, there are also marked differences in the two books, particularly in their main characters. In Isang Kaibigan, Kwago is surrounded by friends until he lost everything during a storm. He was in despair and felt helpless until his last remaining friend came to his rescue. In Just a Little Blue, Owly is a kind, generous, and pro-active character who goes out of his way to help others and, in the process, gains friends. Author and activist Ninotchka Rosca first posted about Owly: Just a Little Blue, on Wednesday, August 21, explaining the book’s synopsis. “Ay, natawa ako (I laughed),” Rosca wrote right after the book’s description. Other Filipino writers then began to take notice of the supposed similarities between Duterte’s book and Runton’s book. Rappler columnist Antonio J. Montalvan II questioned if the reason behind Duterte’s outburst during her exchange with Hontiveros was because the book was plagiarized. “Is this the reason for the tantrum? The question was simple – what is the book about? Then she flared up. Dahil ba [plagiarized] ang book (Is it because the book is plagiarized)? That’s [P10 million] for possible plagiarism,” Montalvan wrote. Meanwhile, another netizen called on others to search up the other Owly books to check for plagiarism, also speculating that this could be the reason why Duterte had gotten upset during the budget hearing. In an X post, journalist Raissa Robles also asked Runton to check if he thinks Isang Kaibigan bears any similarities with his book. To @Owly – Pls look if this book looks similar to yours. Thanks. https://t.co/7ynveGhKFn As of this writing, however, Runton has yet to comment on the matter. As accusations of plagiarism spread online, Vice President Duterte issued a statement rejecting the claims, saying it was easy to write a short story based on experience, and hinted on her upcoming book about betrayal. Isang Kaibigan is part of the OVP’s flagship program, “PagbaBAGo Campaign,” where one million beneficiaries will receive bags that contain the book. The book is 16 pages long, and was published by the OVP. – Rappler.com",True,true,Did ‘Owly: Just a Little Blue’ inspire Sara Duterte’s ‘Isang Kaibigan’ book?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/literature/owly-just-a-little-blue-sara-duterte-isang-kaibigan/,Rappler
"Happy New Year! With President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. failing to sign the national budget, we are entering 2026 with a “reenacted budget,” if only for a few days or weeks. This is set to be the first reenacted budget since 2019. In that year, the budget was also stymied by controversies and frictions surrounding pork allocations and insertions. Old governance problems are hounding us in 2026. What led to the 2019 reenacted budget? For starters, former budget secretary Benjamin Diokno was accused by the late representative Rolando Andaya of inserting at least P2.8 billion of infrastructure budgets that will benefit Casiguran, Sorsogon. Why Casiguran? Its mayor then was the husband of the mother-in-law of Diokno’s daughter, while Sorsogon’s vice governor then was the mother-in-law of Diokno’s daughter. This and other budget insertions were allegedly facilitated by Amenah Pangandaman, Diokno’s closest budget undersecretary, who was said to have given a thumb drive to a Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) staff member containing a list of P51 billion worth of infrastructure projects. Total insertions that year allegedly reached P75 billion. Eerily, this brings to mind the recent and alleged tug-of-war of files between Representative Leandro Leviste and the late public works undersecretary Catalina Cabral. Cabral was said to possess a list of projects that are “allocable” to lawmakers, and Representative Leviste allegedly snatched those files from Cabral’s office back in September 2025. Leviste said such files were given to him, not stolen. At any rate, it’s quite clear that the budget of the Department of Public Works and Highways is a crucial entry point of politicians’ pork, then and now. Going back to 2019, Diokno vehemently denied the allegations levelled against him by Andaya. But not long after, Diokno stepped down and moved on to become the governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (a golden parachute). He brought with him Pangandaman to the BSP. Incidentally, both would figure prominently in the early Cabinet of President Marcos Jr.: in 2022, Diokno returned as finance secretary, while Pangandaman became budget secretary — until she resigned recently, in November 2025, amid the flood control scandal. Former House speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo also inserted tons of pork in the 2019 budget for her own legislative district, amounting to P2.4 billion. Reacting to this, Senator Leila de Lima, who was detained at Camp Crame at the behest of former president Rodrigo Duterte, said in a dispatch, “It is scandalous and shameless, but hardly a surprise. We do not expect anything less from Speaker Arroyo who, during her rule as President, was known for putting self-interest above public service.” What’s more, even after the 2019 budget bicameral conference committee or bicam, the House managed to play around with the Department of Health’s budget, specifically its Health Facilities Enhancement Program or HFEP. This is highly anomalous, because Congress ought to stick with the draft bill approved by the bicam. But the House allegedly distributed the P4.5 billion allotted to the House of Representatives, chopping up that pork budget and allocating it among its members. Supposedly, much of that fund went to Arroyo’s allies (supporters of her House leadership), while a much smaller amount went to non-allies. In total, as much as P75 billion of projects were realigned after the bicam under the Local Infrastructure Program. This maneuver led to a budget impasse, led by Senator Panfilo Lacson, a known fiscalizer. The country entered 2019 with no new budget, and in March 2019 president Duterte met with congressional leaders to fix the deadlock. It was only later that month that the Senate submitted the enrolled bill, albeit with “strong reservations.” In mid-April 2019, Duterte finally signed the budget, literally unceremoniously (journalists were only informed by text message that Duterte had already signed the bill). But Duterte ended up vetoing as much as P95.3 billion worth of DPWH projects that were “not part of [his] priority projects,” and assigned some projects for “conditional implementation.” These include “the allowance and benefits of teachers and creation of teaching positions, construction of evacuation centers, funding for foreign-assisted projects, revolving fund, and lump-sum appropriations for capital outlays, as well as financial assistance to local government units and funding requirements of our foreign service.” Fast-forward to 2026, pork hobbles the budget once more, specifically pork lodged under the DPWH. House lawmakers tried their darndest to insert projects under the DPWH, not under flood control but mainly for farm-to-market roads (now to be overseen by the Department of Agriculture) and the HFEP (which also plays a role now — an echo to the 2019 controversy). In a highly irregular move, DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon also appeared before the bicam to lobby the restoration of P54 billion worth of funding. This intervention by the executive created an impasse and the Senate stood its ground, leading to a full stoppage of the bicam proceedings. Eventually, the Senate allowed a partial restoration of the DPWH budget. The ball is now with President Marcos, and as I write this the Palace is scrutinizing the enrolled budget bill for 2026. What should he do? If he’s really committed to show the people that he’s reforming the budget (the root of all evil, so to speak), he might take a leaf from what former president Rodrigo Duterte did in 2019, and veto tons of needless pork projects that they’re not part of his priorities. Back in December 2024, Marcos vetoed P194 billion, P168.240 billion of which were unprogrammed funds and the rest (P26.065 billion) were DPWH projects. For the 2026 budget, he will most likely veto a portion of the P243-billion unprogrammed funds as well. But this will do nothing, really, because unprogrammed appropriations can’t be spent on unless there are excess revenues or new loans. If Marcos is really sincere, he will push for reforms to remove unprogrammed funds entirely in the 2027 budget and beyond. Cases have been filed before the Supreme Court to rule unprogrammed funds unconstitutional (because of the way they have been abused in the budget process). But Marcos will do well to move ahead of this Supreme Court decision and push Congress to pass a law banning unprogrammed funds forever. But I doubt this will happen. If he were really sincere, he would’ve done so years ago, and stop related perversions like the plundering of the coffers of PhilHealth and the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation. Also, Marcos knows that bringing home pork projects is the primary game played in the House of Representatives, and his relatives benefitted from this scheme of late. In fact, a report of the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) found that a big bulk of “allocable” projects went to Marcos’ son Sandro and cousin Martin Romualdez. All in all, the 2026 budget is more of the same. They removed flood control allocations but made up for it in other ways. But truth be told, I’m not really disappointed: in the first place, I didn’t have my hopes up that significant reforms will take place. – Rappler.com Dr. JC Punongbayan is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of False Nostalgia: The Marcos “Golden Age” Myths and How to Debunk Them.

"In a banking system built on confidence, deposit insurance is the keel that keeps the ship upright when seas turn rough. In the Philippines, that keel is the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC). And yet, in 2024, the government chose to plane down that keel — remitting over ₱117 billion from PDIC to the Bureau of the Treasury — just months before doubling deposit coverage in March 2025. I don’t see that as an act of prudence, but of self-inflicted fragility. Start with the hard facts. PDIC’s total assets fell by about 18% in 2024, dropping to roughly ₱278 billion after the state took ₱107.2 billion (under the GAA or General Appropriations Act) plus ₱10.7 billion in dividends. I did not dream up these statistics; they’re in PDIC’s 2024 reporting as covered by the press on October 15, 2025. Now, consider the exposure side of the ledger. Effective March 15, 2025, the maximum deposit insurance coverage (MDIC) doubled from ₱500,000 to ₱1,000,000 per depositor per bank. Regulators and banks framed it as a confidence booster for small savers — and it is — but it also doubles PDIC’s potential liability. Even industry and government advisories emphasize that shift. What happens when you expand the umbrella while slicing the fabric? In 2024, PDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF)-to-insured deposits ratio was reported around the high-single digits. With the higher MDIC and a growing deposit base, the projected cushion slimmed further into 2025. That is exactly the wrong direction if your goal is to keep depositors calm when a small or mid-sized bank falters. Defenders of the remittance will say, “It’s lawful.” Indeed, the GAA permitted it. But lawful is not synonymous with wise — especially when dealing with a fiduciary fund. PDIC is not a profit-seeking government-owned or -controlled corporation (GOCC) designed to remit surplus earnings; it’s a statutory safety net funded primarily by insurance premiums from banks and investment income precisely to be there when failures occur. That’s how well-run deposit insurers work across the world: the fund is built from assessments on the industry, not harvested for fiscal cosmetics. If you want a clear benchmark, look at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the United States. Its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) is funded “mainly through quarterly assessments on insured banks,” not by taxpayers, and it operates according to a Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR) policy that targets a long-run fund size (the FDIC Board has adopted a 2.0% DRR in recent years). The FDIC’s framework is explicit: grow the fund through assessments until the target reserve ratio is reached and adjust rates to stay on track. It is not designed to remit its reserves to the Treasury to beautify budget arithmetic. Equally important — especially after the 2023 US regional bank turmoil — the FDIC reiterated that deposit insurance is not taxpayer-funded in normal times; losses are covered by the industry via assessments, and when shocks drain the fund, the FDIC levies special assessments on banks to rebuild it. That’s how a safety net maintains credibility without raiding its own reserves for unrelated fiscal needs. Some will counter: PDIC’s income rose in 2024, and the fund still looks “adequate.” But that argument confuses flow with stock. Income is an annual flow — helpful, yes — but the stock of liquid, ready-to-deploy claims-paying resources is what matters in a crisis. When you siphon ₱117 billion from the insurer in a single year, you shrink the available shock absorber. That the system didn’t break last week is not evidence that the policy was sound; it is evidence that we’ve been lucky. And if you want to see a neighbor that takes fund sufficiency seriously, look at Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia (PIDM). PIDM publishes balances for its Conventional and Islamic Deposit Insurance Funds, and it operates under a Target Fund framework — a policy tool that explicitly sizes the fund against modeled loss scenarios and gives it authority to raise assessments or borrow to maintain adequate coverage. In 2024, PIDM reported a combined DIF balance of about RM 4.915 billion, alongside additional protection funds for insurance/takaful — proof that even in a smaller system, the architecture is oriented toward building buffers, not extracting them. Even if one were to argue that the PDIC had “excess” buffers — it didn’t! — timing would still kill the case. The government pulled the largest chunk in 2024, and then in March 2025, when MDIC doubled to ₱1 million, fully insuring over 147 million accounts (roughly 98.6% of total accounts). If you are going to increase coverage, you build the fund first. You do not enlarge the promise and then thin the wallet. That invites the very loss of confidence deposit insurance is designed to prevent. “But our banks are fine.” Until they’re not. The purpose of a deposit insurance fund is not to predict each failure; it is to be credible when failures occur. Rural and thrift banks — often the backbone of local credit — are the first to feel deposit flight. When headlines mention PDIC’s assets falling and its remittances rising, the whisper in the countryside becomes: “Can they still pay?” That whisper is how liquidity runs begin. And here’s the uncomfortable truth: once a run starts, you don’t stop it with mere talking points. You stop it with unambiguous capacity to pay claims fast. That capacity rests on the fund you’ve kept and the authority you wield to rebuild it, not on how much you remitted last year to dress up the national budget. United States (FDIC). The FDIC’s board sets a DRR each year — currently targeted at 2.0% long-run — and manages assessment rates to reach and maintain it. After the 2023 failures (Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank), the FDIC adopted a special assessment to restore the DIF, with the industry paying the bill over several quarters — no fiscal raids, no budget theatrics. The FDIC’s fund is invested in nonmarketable Treasury securities, can access borrowing lines in emergencies, and — crucially — its finances are off-budget, funded by the industry rather than appropriations. Malaysia (PIDM). PIDM’s 2024 Annual Report details fund balances and a Target Fund methodology. Where the protection fund proves insufficient, PIDM has clear legal authority to raise premiums, borrow from government, or issue debt to bridge gaps — codified tools to preserve confidence. That is institutional muscle memory focused on fund adequacy, not fiscal remittance. They are certainly not academic differences, but are design choices that separate stable systems from fragile ones when the cycle turns. PDIC’s resources exist to protect depositors — not to plug fiscal holes. When the Treasury extracts ₱117 billion in a year, it sends two corrosive signals: Contrast that with the messaging from FDIC and PIDM: assessments flow into the fund to meet insurance objectives, targets define how much is enough, and special tools kick in to rebuild when shocks hit. That is forward-looking stewardship. Fiscal managers love the optics of remittances, which they read as “discipline.” But the outcome is a thinner PDIC at a time of higher obligations. It is easy to celebrate a one-off boost to non-tax revenues. It is harder to explain why, when a rural bank fails next year, payouts take longer, confidence wobbles more, and the contagion risk widens. The truth is simple: a peso remitted is a peso not available to pay insured claims. Worse, the decision can force second-order costs: higher risk-based insurance premiums later (to replenish the fund), tighter bank margins, and more cautious lending — an indirect tax on the economy that dwarfs the photo-op of last year’s remittance. There are three immediate reforms that would realign policy with the public interest: Let’s run a simple pre-mortem. Imagine a mid-sized thrift bank buckling under credit losses. Depositors line up. Social media amplifies doubts: “Didn’t PDIC’s assets drop last year? Didn’t they remit ₱117B?” The rumor outruns the rebuttal. Two more banks wobble. Suddenly, the cost of the previous year’s “discipline” overwhelms the optics: you discover that the cheapest crisis is the one you prevented by funding the umbrella properly. History’s lesson is brutal: deposit insurance failures are rarely about law, and always about confidence. You don’t inspire confidence by hollowing the lifeboat. Congress should protect PDIC’s fund the way central banks protect their balance sheets: as critical infrastructure. The executive should treat PDIC as a systemic safeguard, not a dividend machine. And PDIC should make it impossible — politically and technically — for anyone to raid the fund again without a public fight. We can still fix this. The MDIC has already risen to ₱1 million as of March 15, 2025; that policy only succeeds if the fund behind it is ironclad. Do what the best systems do: set a target, levy the industry, and keep every cent in the pot for the day it’s needed. Because the next time waves hit, depositors won’t be measuring your press releases. They’ll be measuring the depth of the fund — and how fast it pays. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] How the treasury drained PDIC’s shield – right when we needed it strongest,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-how-treasury-drained-philippine-deposit-insurance-corporation/,Rappler
"SYDNEY, Australia – Australia’s Qantas Airways said on Sunday, October 12, that it was one of the companies whose customer data had been published by cybercriminals after it was stolen by a hacker in a July breach of a database containing the personal information of the airline’s customers. The airline said in July that more than a million customers had sensitive details such as phone numbers, birth dates or home addresses accessed in one of Australia’s biggest cyber breaches in years. Another four million customers had just their name and email address taken during the hack, it said at the time. The July breach represented Australia’s most high-profile cyberattack since telecommunications giant Optus and health insurer Medibank were hit in 2022, incidents that prompted mandatory cyber resilience laws. On Sunday, Qantas said in a statement that it was “one of a number of companies globally that has had data released by cyber criminals following the airline’s cyber incident in early July, where customer data was stolen via a third party platform”. “With the help of specialist cyber security experts, we are investigating what data was part of the release,” it said. “We have an ongoing injunction in place to prevent the stolen data being accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published by anyone, including third parties,” the airline added. Hacker collective Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters is behind the Qantas data release, which occurred after a ransom deadline set by the group passed, the Guardian Australia news site reported.

"MANILA, Philippines – Have you noticed how gold prices have lately been climbing almost relentlessly? Earlier in April, Goldman Sachs bumped its end-2025 target for gold to around $3,700 per troy ounce (up from $3,300 earlier). Spot gold has since surged beyond those levels, breaking $4,000 in early October and touching an intra-day record high of $4,378 on October 17. Analysts are now even floating the possibility of nearly $5,000 an ounce within the next year if current trends hold. So, is it time to start looking at gold bars as an investment? Gold often shines brightest when the world looks uncertain. Several overlapping factors are behind its latest surge. One is monetary policy. When the US Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low – or even hints that rate cuts are looming – non-yielding assets like gold tend to become more appealing. That’s because the opportunity cost of holding them (versus earning interest on bonds or deposits) decreases. Conversely, when the Fed tightens or when US Treasury yields climb, gold can lose momentum. The dollar also plays a crucial role. A weaker US dollar makes gold cheaper for investors using other currencies, stimulating global demand. But when the dollar strengthens, it usually drags gold down. In the past few months, shifting expectations about US monetary policy have caused both the dollar and gold to seesaw, sometimes in opposite directions. Beyond monetary policy, geopolitical risk has fueled gold’s safe-haven appeal. Conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, together with slowing global growth, have encouraged investors to park wealth in assets that don’t depend on governments or corporate earnings. Gold, as a tangible and universally tradable commodity, tends to thrive in moments of fear or uncertainty. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which can swing wildly, or fiat currencies that lose value through inflation, gold retains a reputation for permanence. That reputation is why it often acts as a hedge against inflation. When the cost of goods rises, so does the appeal of owning something with finite supply and intrinsic value. Central banks buy, hold, and sell gold as part of managing their reserves. Here’s how the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) explains it: “Gold prices tend to move in the opposite direction of other assets. Therefore, central banks hold some gold as a hedge against price declines in other assets in the reserves.” However, the BSP also cautioned that gold has limitations. It earns little to no interest, can be volatile, and requires storage and insurance. In September 2024, the BSP sold part of its gold holdings after the metal’s price rose beyond what it considers an “ideal ratio” of eight to ten percent of total reserves. (READ: [In This Economy] Why Filipinos shouldn’t panic over the sale of gold reserves) “Gold prices recently rose, pushing our holdings above the ideal ratio, so we sold some,” BSP Governor Eli Remolona said in March 2025, as reported by Philippine Star. The move drew criticism from some observers who argued that the BSP should have held longer, given that prices have since climbed to all-time highs. Remolona, however, dismissed the notion of market-timing. “We’re not betting on prices — we don’t claim to know if gold prices will rise or fall. Those saying we shouldn’t have sold are free to invest themselves,” he added. See, even central banks treat gold as a hedge, not a speculative bet. They hold just enough to offset risks elsewhere, not to chase profits. This point is especially important for retail investors to understand as they start to add gold into their portfolio. Across the country, there’s growing interest in owning physical gold, whether that’s in the form of coins or bars. Investors want to diversify beyond savings accounts and stocks. One notable development is the launch of the MDLR Legacy Gold Bar Collection by Mayet Dela Rosa Fine Jewelry. Perhaps better known for its jewelry pieces, the company is also now expanding into investment-grade gold bars. A post shared by Mayet De La Rosa Fine Jewelry (@mayetdelarosa) Its gold bars are crafted to international purity standards (999.9 fineness), hallmarked, serial-numbered, and authenticated by Heraeus, a global assayer. “[Gold]’s immune to the volatility of digital markets and inflationary currencies. We see it not merely as adornment, but as protection — an heirloom of security,” chief executive officer Mayet Dela Rosa said in a press release. “We’re making it easy to start small and start now, one bar at a time.” Other players are also making gold more accessible. Palawan Pawnshop, for example, also launched Palawan Gold, a coin-based gold investment product that allows customers to own 24-karat, gold-backed assets with verified weight and purity. For high-net-worth individuals, EastWest Bank has partnered with Hong Kong-based bullion firm J. Rotbart & Co. to give its Priority clients direct access to physical gold purchases. Clients with at least P2.5 million in investible funds can consult their relationship managers to acquire and store gold as part of a diversified portfolio. For ordinary investors, the key is understanding what gold can – and cannot – do for you. Gold is non-yielding, meaning it doesn’t generate periodic income like dividends or interest. Your return depends entirely on price appreciation, which can fluctuate with global conditions. As mentioned earlier, it’s best treated as a hedge or stabilizer rather than your main growth engine. When the economy is thriving and stocks or real estate are surging, gold may lag behind. Its strength lies in preservation, not performance. This is also how central banks use gold in their portfolio. Keep in mind too that gold, like any asset, is not immune to corrections. Recent market data show that gold futures traded as low as $3,937 per ounce. It’s too early to say whether this would continue into a downtrend, but that remains a possibility. Owning gold also comes with logistics. Whether you buy from a brand like Mayet Dela Rosa or through coins like Palawan Gold, you need to consider authenticity, storage, and resale. The bars and coins can be stored in tamper-proof safes or bank deposit boxes, but that means added cost and security responsibility. You’ll also want to check how easily you can liquidate the metal if needed and at what spread from market prices. For high-net-worth clients, partnerships like EastWest’s with J. Rotbart & Co. provide formalized channels for larger, insured holdings. But for most people, smaller bars or coins may make more practical entry points. Ultimately, don’t get too caught up in this global fascination with gold unless you know why you want to add it into your portfolio. Holding gold should be part of a balanced portfolio; it should be a complement to your stocks, bonds, and cash, not a replacement. If you’re looking to protect value amid uncertainty, gold offers that anchor. But don’t expect this rapid growth to continue indefinitely. Gold certainly won’t provide you with the same kind of lucrative returns as a hot tech stock. – Rappler.com Lance Spencer Yu is a former business journalist for Rappler.

"The Philippine stock market is sending a troubling signal: profitability no longer commands a premium. Some of the country’s most profitable publicly listed companies — GT Capital, LT Group, DMCI Holdings, Aboitiz Equity Ventures, and Semirara Mining & Power — are generating tens of billions of pesos in annual earnings yet trade at valuation multiples that imply permanent decline. Discounted by conglomerate structure, cyclicality, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) discomfort, or sheer narrative fatigue, these firms reveal a deeper market inefficiency: the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) is no longer rewarding cash flow, balance-sheet discipline, or dividend capacity. In sidelining companies that already deliver real, audited profits, the market is mistaking storytelling for value — and creating a widening gap between financial performance and stock price that long-term investors ignore at their own risk. In efficient markets, profitability is supposed to be the ultimate referee. Cash flows validate strategy; earnings discipline excess. Yet the Philippine equity market has quietly inverted that logic. Today, some of the country’s most profitable publicly listed companies trade as if profits were incidental — nice to have, but not worth paying for. The result is a growing disconnect between corporate performance and market valuation that deserves closer scrutiny. Consider LT Group, a company that quietly generated close to ₱29 billion in net income in 2024 across banking, distilled spirits, tobacco, and property. By any global standard, that is real money — recurring, diversified, and cash-generative. Yet, the stock trades at valuation multiples more typical of a distressed cyclical business. The market’s discount appears less about earnings durability and more about narrative fatigue: a conglomerate structure, regulatory exposure, and the absence of a fashionable growth story. What is missing in that narrative is that LT Group’s profits are not speculative — they are already realized, taxed, and available for dividends or reinvestment. The same paradox defines GT Capital. With nearly ₱29 billion in attributable net income in 2024, GT Capital sits atop some of the most strategically important franchises in the country, from banking to automotive. Yet, it trades at a holding-company discount so steep that the market seems to be pricing in permanent stagnation. Investors talk endlessly about optionality and disruption, but ignore the embedded value of scale, capital discipline, and dominant market positions. The irony is that GT Capital’s earnings are precisely the kind that compound quietly over time — steady, resilient, and inflation-protective — but the market assigns them little premium. (READ: Toyota Motor Philippines sets new sales record as PH middle class expands) DMCI Holdings offers another illustration of this profit paradox. In 2024, DMCI delivered about ₱19 billion in net income, underpinned by construction, power, mining, and property. The market, however, continues to treat DMCI as if its earnings are perpetually one downturn away from collapse. Commodity exposure and infrastructure cyclicality dominate investor perception, even as the company continues to throw off cash and pay generous dividends. Cyclicality is predictable patterns (ups and downs) that certain industries, stocks, and economic factors follow in sync with the overall business cycle. What the market misses is that DMCI has already internalized cyclicality into its capital allocation model. Its profits are not accidental; they are engineered through conservative leverage, project discipline, and a willingness to sit out bad cycles. Then there is Aboitiz Equity Ventures (AEV), a name synonymous with operational competence and long-term capital stewardship. With over ₱18 billion in net income in 2024, AEV remains a pillar of Philippine corporate profitability. Yet, its valuation suggests that investors are more focused on near-term capital expenditures and sector rotation than on normalized earnings power. Power generation transitions, banking exposure, and infrastructure investments are framed as risks rather than as platforms for durable cash flows. The market, in effect, is penalizing AEV for investing for the future — even though those investments are funded by existing profitability. Finally, Semirara Mining & Power exemplifies how ideology can overwhelm arithmetic. Despite generating nearly ₱10 billion in net income in 2024, Semirara trades as though its profits are morally obsolete. ESG concerns, coal aversion, and energy-transition narratives dominate the discourse, pushing valuation multiples down, regardless of actual cash generation. Multiple is a valuation ratio comparing a company’s market value to a key financial metric (like earnings or sales) to assess if it’s overvalued or undervalued relative to peers. What is often overlooked is that Semirara’s profits are financing dividends, balance-sheet strength, and — ironically — parts of the energy transition itself. Markets may dislike coal, but coal cash still spends. How these hypothetical targets are constructed: These are illustrative, not precise price forecasts. They are meant to show what happens if the market ever starts to reward profitability the way it has historically. Disclaimer: Although illustrative, they are not investment advice. They don’t forecast share prices into the future based on company guidance or consensus earnings growth. They are based on simple valuation re-rating logic and publicly available market prices and multiples. Viewed together, these companies expose a deeper issue in Philippine equities: profitability has lost its signaling power. The market is not asking, “How much money does this company make?” but rather, “Does this story fit the current investment fashion?” Conglomerates are dismissed as inefficient by default. Cyclicals are treated as uninvestable. Transition industries are discounted before transitions are even completed. In that environment, earnings — actual, audited, distributable earnings — are treated as backward-looking trivia. Vantage Point views this not merely a valuation anomaly; it is a behavioral one. Investors have become so conditioned to chase growth narratives and thematic purity that they undervalue what profitability truly represents: proof of execution. Profits mean a business has survived competition, regulation, labor costs, and capital constraints —and still delivered surplus value. Ignoring that is not sophistication; it is selective blindness. For long-term investors, this disconnect may be precisely where opportunity lies. Markets can stay enamored with stories longer than expected, but they rarely ignore cash forever. When sentiment eventually rotates — toward dividends, balance-sheet strength, or simple earnings yield — the companies already doing the hard work of generating profits will not need to reinvent themselves. They will simply be re-rated. In the end, the Philippine market’s greatest inefficiency today may not be mispricing risk. It may be mispricing success. Below is Vantage Point’s tight, investor-grade “Ignored Value” league table that formalizes what I’ve been arguing narratively. Methodology (simple, transparent): Each company is scored 1–5 (best) across four dimensions, then ranked by Total Score (max 20). This is absolutely a market-mispricing table — measuring how much profitability the market is failing to reward. PSE “Ignored Value” League Table (FY2024) 1) GT Capital — The market’s cleanest blind spot GT Capital ranks #1 not because it is the fastest grower, but because it combines scale with the deepest valuation discount. A sub-5x earnings multiple for a holding company anchored on systemically important banking and dominant automotive franchises is plainly dismissal. This is the purest example of profit without prestige, and therefore the most mispriced. 2) LT Group — Large, real, and persistently ignored LTG earns almost as much as GT Capital but trades like a regulatory accident waiting to happen. The market conflates complexity with fragility. Banking, alcohol, and tobacco are treated as permanent overhangs, even though they are precisely the sources of LTG’s stable cash flow. The result: profits that are recognized in financial statements but discounted in share price. 3) DMCI — Dividend reality vs narrative risk DMCI’s valuation reflects a market that refuses to believe that cyclicals can be well-run. Its high-dividend yield props up its score, even as investors insist on treating the company as ex-growth. The irony is that DMCI has institutionalized cyclicality into its business model — yet still gets priced as if every cycle is terminal. 4) Aboitiz Equity Ventures — Penalized for investing AEV is not cheap in the crude sense, but it is cheap relative to the earnings it already produces. Power transition risk, capital expenditure (CapEx) cycles, and banking exposure weigh on sentiment. The market is effectively discounting future profits before they even arrive — despite the fact that those investments are funded by current profitability. 5) Semirara — Profits that offend the narrative Semirara scores lower on balance-sheet risk, not because it is weak, but because its earnings are politically and ideologically inconvenient. Coal exposure ensures a structural discount regardless of payout strength. Yet, from a pure capital-return standpoint, Semirara is one of the most shareholder-friendly names on the PSE. Across all five companies, the pattern is unmistakable: I believe that this is no longer stock-picking anomaly, but rather a market-wide valuation bias. In mature markets, companies this profitable would anchor pension portfolios. In the Philippines, they are treated as intellectually unfashionable. That disconnect is precisely what long-term capital is supposed to exploit. If and when the PSE rediscovers the basic principle that earnings are not optional, this “ignored value” basket will not need better stories. It will only need the market to remember how to count. – Rappler.com Click here for more Vantage Point articles.",True,true,Vantage Point’s top 5 undervalued Philippine publicly listed companies,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-top-undervalued-philippine-publicly-listed-companies/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – If you live in Metro Manila and frequent malls, those flashy electric vehicles you see are hard to miss. China, which made it a policy to specialize in electric vehicles (EVs), currently dominates the EV market worldwide. China-made cars were once derided for their lousy designs. Not anymore, not by a long shot. In fact, many of the Chinese EVs have surpassed Japanese and American cars when it comes to design. Ditto for Vietnam’s EVs such as VinFast. These cars look like the ones shown in fictional sci-fi movies. In suburbs, too, there are more e-trikes on the road, due partly to their affordability to the masses. Registration of two- and three-wheeled EVs has gone up from only 172 in 2023 to 43,441 in 2024, a 25,156% increase. Some of these EVs were displayed in the recently concluded 13th Philippine Electric Vehicle Summit held October 23, Thursday, to October 25, Saturday, at the SMX Convention Center in Pasay City. And the star of the summit, of course, was BYD, the world’s leader in EVs, currently being distributed in the Philippines by Ayala Corporation subsidiary ACMobility. BYD Cars Philippines country head Adam Hu said BYD has delivered 3.2 million new Energy vehicles (nEvs) worldwide as of September 2024. BYD Cars Philippines unveiled during the summit its BYD eMAX 9 DM-i, a family car which can run 1,200 kilometers on a full charge plus a full tank of gas. That covers a trip from Manila to Baguio and back without need for a refill or recharge. The 7-seater car’s interior looks like the business class of an airplane, with a pair of captain’s seats with massage feature and a 6-bottle mini-fridge. It also has middle-row tables for convenient use of laptops. Price tag? The BYD eMAX 9 DM-i premium variant sells for P2.99 million, while the advanced variant costs P2.67 million. In last year’s 12th Philippine Electric Vehicle Summit, ACMobility CEO Jaime Alfonso Zobel de Ayala talked about the company’s move to help “transform the electric vehicle landscape in the Philippines.” This year, ACMobility representatives discussed the “daunting task” of building a network of charging stations nationwide to help address car buyers’ concern about “range anxiety” or the fear of not being able to charge their vehicle due to lack of charging stations. The Asian Development Bank has provided $100 million or around P5.8 billion in co-financing with Ayala Corporation for the procurement of EV charging stations and of more EVs for commercial distribution. Though the growing presence of these EVs on the road may seem like Filipino consumers are finally adopting green vehicles, the numbers say otherwise. According to the Department of Energy, based on Land Transportation Office (LTO) data, there were only 24,286 EVs registered in the Philippines in 2024, accounting for only 0.2% of total registered vehicles. On the other hand, there were 14,595,467 conventional vehicles (gas and diesel) registered, which means 99.8% were conventional. The percentages were not that different from 2023 LTO data (see graph below from the Philippine Statistics Authority): gasoline-powered vehicles reached 11.23 million or 78.7% of the total number of registered vehicles in 2023; 3.03 million or 21.3% were diesel vehicles; 0.1% were others, i.e. Liquified Petroleum Gas (3 registered vehicles), Compressed Natural Gas (9 registered vehicles), electric (1.36 thousand registered vehicles), and hybrid (6.16 thousand registered vehicles). Admittedly, the Electric Vehicle Association of the Philippines (EVAP) said the country is still a long way from reaching a tipping point toward adopting EVs. “Unfortunately, we’re not,” said EVAP president Edmund Araga, when asked recently by the ABS-CBN News Channel’s Market Edge if the Philippine EV market had reached “inflection point.” But Araga prefers to look at the glass half-full than half-empty. He said that around 29,000 EVs were registered from January to June 2025, a 100% increase from the number of EVs registered from 2013 to 2024. An October 2024 EVAP report said there’s been an 8.4% annual average growth in market sales of EVs from 2013 to 2023. Araga said many car buyers are “very engaged” in switching to hybrids and EVs, and that the interest extends to companies that are shifting from internal combustion engines (ICEs) to electrified vehicles for their trucks and buses. Araga highlighted the need for local government units (LGUs) to push the EV industry in order to convince more consumers to adopt EVs.

"MANILA, Philippines – After opening their 88th mall in the President’s hometown last May, the Sy family is set to unveil mall No. 89 to the public in La Union, the Philippines’ surfing capital in the north, on Friday, October 17. And the opening of SM City La Union perhaps best exemplifies why bricks-and-mortar retail are here to stay in the Philippines despite the popularity of online shopping. The three-story mall’s opening weekend in what’s also known as “ELYU” offers physical and community engagements that e-commerce can never match. Lined up are a beach volleyball tournament with 16 participating teams, frisbee play, three nights with DJs, sunset music sessions, and fireworks. All these seek to match the mall’s “vibe” with La Union’s reputation as a surfing capital. A post shared by SM City La Union (@smcitylaunion) These events are set to be held within the mall’s premises, mostly in a recreational space called “Sandbox.” This is a 1,348-square-meter outdoor venue, including a sand volleyball court, for sports tournaments, mini-concerts, yoga, Zumba, and other community activities. “Alongside it runs a bike lane parallel to a man-made sandbar, giving cyclists a unique way to enjoy the area’s open-air setting,” SM Prime said. SM City La Union also has water fountains, a long faćade with vertical fins that mimic waves, plus an art installation by artist-designer Leeroy New, whose works often portray the need for sustainable development. “Using bamboo, upcycled bottles, and construction scraps, he created a spaceship-inspired canopy that reflects light and sound throughout the day, symbolizing transformation and renewal,” said SM Megamalls. The mall’s interior also has “double-height atrium”that connects the Department Store, cinemas, and food hall,“with clerestories and wide glass spans bringing natural light across all three levels,” the country’s largest mall operator and developer said. In a statement on Wednesday, October 15, SM Prime president Jeffrey Lim said: “This is our ninth mall in Northern Luzon and we designed it to serve as a landmark for both residents and tourists. As the surfing capital of the region, La Union deserves a retail center that reflects its vibrant lifestyle and rich culture.” A post shared by SM City La Union (@smcitylaunion) Last year, La Union’s tourism sector recorded over P1 billion in revenues, driven by an increase in spending per visitor, as well as slightly higher average length stay, from 1.33 days to 1.39 days, the Sy conglomerate said. Over 500,000 tourists visited San Fernando City, and the surfing and beach towns of San Juan and Bauang. “With our diverse and unique offerings, we hope to strengthen La Union’s position as both a tourism and economic hub in Northern Luzon,” Lim said. Unlike SM’s early shopping centers with retail outlets that sell shoes, groceries, plus a few restaurants, the Sy family’s newer malls and the newly renovated ones put a premium on experiential retail rather than retail as simply shopping. In a recent interview with the ABS-CBN News Channel, SM Megamalls president Steven Tan said this shift is in response to what a younger demographic wants. “Filipinos, especially the GenZs and the Gen Alphas, they look for experiences nowadays. It’s no longer you put out your wares, they come and they buy. You really have to entice them, to make it really pleasurable and enjoyable for them,” Tan said. Sports activities have become big draws for the Sys’ malls. Their Mall of Asia Arena in SM MOA, Pasay City, for instance, has become a major source of revenues, with major sporting events being held there, including the FIBA World Cup in 2023. They recently renovated the MOA to include a 1,800-seat FIFA-grade football pitch at the rooftop. SM City La Union’s beach volleyball tournament from October 17, Friday, to October 19, Sunday, with 16 participating teams reflects the growing popularity of volleyball in the Philippines. Indoor volleyball is perhaps now the second most-watched sport next to basketball, with the country’s Premier Volleyball League (PVL) drawing large crowds, even dwarfing audiences in Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) games. Tan said around 40 SM malls also now have pickleball courts, a response to another rising sport in the country. “SM is now the biggest active lifestyle hub [in the Philippines],” he said. Last year, SM Megamalls opened the Japanese-inspired SM City J Mall in Mandaue City, Cebu in Central Visayas. It includes a JDistrict that allows visitors to experience some of Japan’s attractions. Tan said this shift means going to a mall is not just to buy essentials but “has become very experiential.” “Malls have become the modern-day plazas of this era,” he said. SM Supermalls saw a record high of 5.2 million average daily foot traffic in 2024, up 6% from the 4.9 million logged in 2023. It had also set aside P21 billion for mall expansions this year.

"MANILA, Philippines – A “small majority” of adult Filipinos want the immediate passage of a law banning political dynasties in the Philippines, the latest survey of Pulse Asia Research, Incorporated shows. The results of the nationwide survey released on Monday, December 29, also showed that agreement on the passage of the long-proposed measure is lowest in Mindanao. “The predominant sentiment among Filipino adults (54%) is one of agreement with the Congress immediately passing a law banning political dynasties in the country. This observation also holds true in Metro Manila (69%), the rest of Luzon (59%), the Visayas (59%), and Class D (57%),” Pulse Asia said in a press statement on Monday, December 29. “Public opinion on the matter is split three (3) ways in Mindanao (34% agreement, 38% indecision, and 27% disagreement),” the pollster added. The survey showed that more Filipinos are undecided over their agreement or disagreement with the immediate passage of an anti-dynasty law (27%) compared to those who disagree with it (18%). The survey was done from December 12 to 15, or days after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. urged Congress to prioritize passing an anti-dynasty bill. Critics dismissed the move as a mere publicity stunt because if the President was really serious about the speedy passage of the measure, he would have certified it as urgent. There are 11 anti-dynasty bills filed in the 20th Congress including, ironically, from the biggest dynasts including presidential son House Majority Leader Sandro Marcos, and House Speaker Bojie Dy. But studied further, only a few of these bills are genuine anti-dynasty measures. Sandro and Dy filed a joint bill that, if passed, would not have any significant effect on their political clans. In their proposed bill, what is only prohibited are family members up to the fourth degree of consanguinity holding office in the same level or jurisdiction. The Marcos-Dy bill, if applied to the current Marcos political dynasty, would only affect two people. For example, on the national level, either President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. or Senator Imee Marcos can serve, while Sandro and his uncles — Leyte 1st District Representative Martin Romualdez and Ilocos Norte 2nd District Representative Angelo Marcos Barba — can still serve simultaneously as they represent different districts. In Ilocos Norte, only one between Governor Cecilia Araneta Marcos and Matthew Marcos Manotoc can serve. The bills filed by the opposition bloc, particularly by Makabayan and Akbayan, prohibit family members up to the fourth degree of consanguity from holding any national or local elective office. The bills also prohibit immediate succession to a family member. There has been a momentum in the anti-political dynasty movement led by the young members of political families themselves, including Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto, although their coalition’s version is more lenient than those of Makabayan and Akbayan. At least 71 of the country’s 82 provincial governments or 87% are led by members of political dynasties, according to research by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ). The 1987 Constitution prohibits political dynasties. Article II, Section 26 says: “The State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law.” However, there is no enabling law to define it. Congress, which must pass this bill, is full of dynasts (8 in every 10 district representatives before the last elections), and the President who must sign it into law is a dynast himself. There are petitions before the Supreme Court asking it to compel Congress to pass the enabling law and to, quite literally, do their job and follow the Constitution. The last one has been pending in the Supreme Court since April 2025. The same Pulse Asia survey showed that 52% of Filipinos want Congress to pass a law to create a “fully empowered” Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI). There was a groundswell in the country for the anti-dynasty movement along with increasing interest in the investigation of the flood control scandal. Some of the public officials who are under investigation, or at who have at least been recommended for investigation, belong to political dynasties who are also contractors. However, momentum has slowed down with the ICI not live-streaming all of its hearings, as some subjects requested executive sessions. To make matters worse, two out of three ICI commissioners have resigned, leaving only the chair — retired SC justice Andres Reyes — to run it. The ICI created by Marcos through an executive order has no prosecutorial power. Any result of their investigation will just be forwarded to prosecutors, who are also already investigating themselves. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Small majority of Filipinos want anti-dynasty law now, support lowest in Mindanao",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/anti-dynasty-law-ici-pulse-asia-survey-december-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has temporarily suspended field audits nationwide under Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 107-2025, a move that has raised questions among taxpayers and businesses currently under investigation. Issued on November 24, the circular pauses most audit and investigation activities to address long-standing systemic issues, strengthen taxpayer protection, and pave the way for a more transparent, standardized, and modern audit process. To clarify the scope of the suspension, the BIR later released RMC No. 109-2025 on December 12, which details the activities covered by the suspension and those that are exempt. Below is a practical Q&A guide to help taxpayers understand what the suspension means, who is affected, and what continues despite the pause. RMC No. 107-2025 temporarily halts BIR field audits and investigations to address systemic weaknesses in tax enforcement, protect taxpayer rights, and establish a more consistent and transparent audit framework. The suspension was issued under the leadership of newly appointed Commissioner Charlito Martin R. Mendoza. The suspension of BIR field audit activities took effect on November 24, 2025. Audit operations will remain on hold until the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issues a formal order lifting the suspension. During this period, only activities expressly exempted under the RMCs are allowed to continue. The suspension applies to all taxpayers currently undergoing audit or investigation, including individuals, corporations, estates, and business owners, provided the examination is being conducted under a Letter of Authority (LOA) or Mission Order (MO). Yes. The suspension covers all BIR offices nationwide, including: For audits covering multiple tax types, if at least one tax type is nearing its prescriptive deadline, the BIR will proceed with the entire audit to prevent incomplete investigations and protect the government’s right to collect taxes. The suspension covers most field audit operations, including: Certain actions are allowed to proceed, including: Notices issued before the suspension, such as Notice of Discrepancies (NODs), PANs, FANs, or FDDAs, remain valid. Taxpayers must continue to observe statutory deadlines for payment or filing protests. Payments for settlements finalized before the suspension may also continue. Moreover, taxpayers may voluntarily settle deficiency taxes during the suspension using BIR Form No. 0605 through eFPS, eBIRForms, or authorized agent banks, even without prior BIR approval. All concerned BIR offices must submit an inventory of pending or unserved LOAs and MOs to the CIR within 15 working days from the RMC’s effective date. For taxpayers, the suspension does not mean a break from compliance. The filing of returns and payment of taxes remain mandatory. Regular BIR transactions — such as registration, issuance of certifications, and tax payments — continue without interruption. RMC No. 107-2025, as clarified by RMC 109-2025, provides temporary relief from field audits but does not suspend tax obligations or enforcement altogether. By understanding what is paused, what continues, and which cases are exempt, taxpayers can better protect their rights while staying compliant during this transition toward a more transparent and standardized tax audit system. – Rappler.com ACG is the most trusted tax advisory firm in the Philippines, providing tax strategy, compliance, and policy advisory services to multinational corporations, foreign investors, and government institutions.

"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Amazon is planning to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs beginning on Tuesday, October 28, as the company pares expenses and compensates for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic, according to three people familiar with the matter. The figure represents a small percentage of Amazon’s 1.55 million total employees, but nearly 10% of its roughly 350,000 corporate employees. This would mark Amazon’s largest job cut since late 2022, when it started to eliminate around 27,000 positions. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. Amazon has been trimming smaller numbers of jobs over the past two years across multiple divisions, including devices, communications and podcasting. The cuts beginning this week may affect a variety of divisions, including human resources, known as People Experience and Technology or PXT; operations, devices and services; and Amazon Web Services, the people said. Managers of impacted teams were asked to undergo training on Monday for how to communicate with staff following email notifications that will start going out on Tuesday morning, the people said. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is undertaking an initiative to reduce what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy, including by reducing the number of managers. He installed an anonymous complaint line for identifying inefficiencies that has elicited some 1,500 responses and over 450 process changes, he said earlier this year. Jassy said in June that the increased use of artificial intelligence tools would likely lead to further job cuts, particularly through automating repetitive and routine tasks. “This latest move signals that Amazon is likely realizing enough AI-driven productivity gains within corporate teams to support a substantial reduction in force,” said Sky Canaves, an eMarketer analyst. “Amazon has also been under pressure in the short-term to offset the long-term investments in building out its AI infrastructure.” The full scope of this round of job cuts was not immediately clear. The people familiar with the matter said the number could change over time as Amazon’s financial priorities shift. Fortune earlier reported that the human resources division could be targeted with a cut of roughly 15%. A program begun early this year to bring employees back in the office five days per week, among tech’s most stringent, has failed to generate sufficient attrition, said two of the people, citing that as another reason for the size of the layoff. Some of the employees who are not swiping in daily because they live far from corporate offices, or for other reasons, are being told they have voluntarily quit Amazon and must leave without severance, a savings for the company. Layoffs.fyi, a website tracking tech job cuts, estimated that about 98,000 jobs have been lost so far this year among 216 companies. For all of 2024, the figure was 153,000. Amazon’s largest profit center, cloud computing unit AWS, reported second-quarter sales of $30.9 billion, a 17.5% increase that was well below gains of 39% for Microsoft’s Azure and of 32% for Alphabet’s Google Cloud. Estimates indicate that AWS will have boosted third-quarter sales by about 18% to $32 billion, a slight slowdown from last year’s 19% increase. AWS is still reeling from a roughly 15-hour internet outage last week that felled many of the most popular online services, like Snapchat SNAP.N and Venmo. Amazon appears to be expecting another big holiday selling season. It plans to offer 250,000 seasonal jobs to help staff warehouses, among other needs, the same as in the prior two years. Amazon on Friday also announced a reorganization of a segment of its PXT unit focused on diversity initiatives, a memo reviewed by Reuters showed. The changes largely involved promoting people to new roles. Amazon shares rose 1.2% to $226.97 on Monday. The company plans to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Amazon targets as many as 30,000 corporate job cuts, sources say",https://www.rappler.com/technology/amazon-corporate-job-cuts-october-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Unemployment improved for a second consecutive month to 3.8% in September as the construction industry added more jobs to the economy, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said on Thursday, November 6. The latest jobless rate translates to around 1.96 million Filipinos. This is lower than the 3.9% or 2.03 million jobless Filipinos tallied in August but higher than the 3.7% or 1.89 million unemployed Filipinos in September 2024. Meanwhile, underemployment worsened in September at 11.1% or 5.52 million Filipinos. This is higher than the 10.7% or 5.38 million underemployed Filipinos in August, but lower than the 11.9% or 5.94 million underemployed Filipinos in August. The construction sector saw the largest increase in employment in September, adding 514,000 jobs since September 2024. National Statistician Dennis Mapa highlighted gains in the jobs related to the construction of buildings, plumbing, and air conditioning installation, as well as the construction of utility projects. However, Mapa noted that the construction sector was also one of the reasons why underemployment figures increased. This means the jobs added to the sector may only be temporary ones. “So posible na may mga workers, but a number or a portion of the workers hindi nagkaroon ng 40-hour job. Some of them are hired, let’s say, as a temporary hand or partial lang ‘yung kanilang work done in that particular week,” he explained. (So it’s possible that there are workers, but a number or a portion of the workers are not working 40 hours a week. Some of them are hired, let’s say, as a temporary hand or their work was only partially done in that particular week.) Mapa added that the flood control scandal might have contributed to the month-on-month reduction of construction jobs. The Department of Public Works and Highways paused bidding for infrastructure projects for nearly two weeks in September. As for job losses, the PSA found that other service activities such as domestic work (-493,000 jobs) shed the most jobs in September. Mapa said the shedding of jobs in domestic work is often tied to household income. He noticed that jobs in domestic work are often added when households make more money. The manufacturing sector also continued to bleed jobs as the industry contracted for the first time in six months in September, according to data from the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Purchasing Managers Index. “New orders and output decreased slightly as firms mentioned a fall in client numbers and a modest drop in production from the suspension of rice imports,” S&P Global Market Intelligence senior economist David Owen said. The Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) said the latest job figures reflect the Philippine labor market’s “resilience” despite headwinds. DEPDev Secretary Arsenio Balisacan underscored the importance of implementing interventions to create more stable, high-quality jobs for the informal sector and the youth. The country’s chief economist cited the recent passage of the Lifelong Learning Development Framework Act, which creates a system for continuing education. “Ensuring the timely release of its implementing rules and regulations is a priority. The government must also actively communicate the policy, particularly to local government units, which will play a key role in promoting lifelong learning,” Balisacan said. – Rappler.com",True,true,Construction job gains push down unemployment to 3.8% in September 2025,https://www.rappler.com/business/unemployment-rate-philippines-september-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The long-awaited debut of Maynilad Water Services Incorporated or Maynilad on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) is finally happening. The country’s largest private water utility is gearing up for the biggest initial public offering (IPO) of the year, in a market where blockbuster listings have become few and far between. It will be the largest public offering the Philippines has seen in years, surpassed only by Monde Nissin’s record-breaking debut in 2021, the biggest IPO in the nation’s history. Maynilad supplies water and wastewater services across the West Zone of Metro Manila, which includes 11 cities and extends to several cities and municipalities in Cavite. It serves around 10.5 million people through a network of treatment plants, reservoirs, pumping stations, and pipelines. The company also operates related businesses such as waterworks engineering, treated bulk water supply, and wastewater operations outside the West Zone. To recap, an IPO is the process by which a private company offers its shares to the public for the first time. Investors can participate by subscribing to shares during the offer period. Once the shares are listed on the exchange, they can be traded like any other publicly listed stock. Maynilad’s IPO stands out not only for its scale but also for the timing and the industry that it’s in. The utility giant will be testing the waters in a sluggish market, with the PSE index hovering near multi-year lows and showing little momentum (READ: [Finterest] What does it really mean when the PSE loses value?). So far, the only other IPO this year has been that of Cebu-based fuel firm Top Line, which raised just P732 million — a far cry from the more than P34 billion Maynilad could bring in. As part of its congressional franchise, Maynilad is mandated to go public by January 2027, meaning this IPO also fulfills a regulatory obligation rather than just being a purely market-driven decision. Maynilad has priced its shares at P15 each, at the upper end of its revised range. The price was lowered from an earlier ceiling of P20 per share after consultations with cornerstone investors including the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the United Kingdom’s Mobilist program. At P15 per share, the company could raise as much as P34.3 billion in gross proceeds, making it the largest IPO of the year. IFC and ADB are set to lead institutional investors with investments of over US$200 million. The IPO, originally targeted for July, will have an offer period running from October 23 to 29, and the shares are set to list and begin trading on the PSE on November 7 under the ticker symbol MYNLD. Proceeds from the IPO will fund capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, including part of Maynilad’s P163.3-billion investment plan from 2023 to 2027. The program aims to expand water and wastewater coverage, construct new treatment facilities, and upgrade its existing network. Maynilad is not a fast-moving tech company. It is a water utility with predictable revenues and heavy regulation, which makes it a classic “defensive” stock. This means its business tends to hold steady even when the broader market weakens or experiences volatility. Over the past two years, Maynilad’s financial performance has been strong. Revenue grew by about 21 percent annually in 2023 and 2024, while net income rose by an average of 47 percent. Its concession agreement with the government runs until 2047, ensuring a long horizon for growth and stability. Maynilad is best suited for investors who want stable returns and can stay invested for the long term rather than those hoping to profit quickly. Still, remember that steady performance does not mean zero risk. Utilities are subject to government regulation, and rate adjustments can take time. Infrastructure projects also require large amounts of capital, so cash flow can fluctuate. These plans could also be disrupted by environmental or humanitarian concerns. The offer period runs from October 23 to 29. If you already have a brokerage account, you can apply for shares through your broker during this window. The exact process varies depending on the platform, but it typically involves filling out an application form and paying for the shares you wish to buy. Once your application is approved and the IPO lists, the shares will automatically appear in your portfolio when trading begins. For example, First Metro Securities allows online clients to subscribe to IPOs through its website by navigating to Account and then Corporate Actions and selecting the stock offering from the list. This feature is currently available only on the web platform, not the mobile app. If you are new to investing, there is also a fully digital option through Maya Stocks, the investing feature inside the Maya app. In partnership with DragonFi Securities, 2TradeAsia, and Philstocks Financial, Maya lets users open and fund a brokerage account with one of the above entirely in-app using their Maya Wallet, with no transfer fees. During the offer period, the Maynilad IPO will appear on the partner brokers’ pages inside the app, where users can select the number of shares they want and confirm their subscription. Before you make any decision to invest, it is worth reviewing Maynilad’s prospectus, which clearly shows the company’s financial statements, strengths, and risks. – Rappler.com Finterest is Rappler’s series that demystifies the world of money and gives practical advice on managing your personal finances.",True,true,"[Finterest] Maynilad’s IPO, 2025’s biggest, is coming.

"“The power to tax is the power to destroy.” In history, it was also the power to destroy corruption. The downfall of Al Capone, one of America’s most infamous gangsters, is the clearest example. Despite evidence of murders and racketeering, what finally put him in prison was tax evasion. In 1931, Al Capone was convicted for failing to pay taxes on his lavish, illegal income and sentenced to 11 years in prison. His case proved one thing: when all else fails, follow the money. This principle has been applied globally. In Italy, mafia bosses were brought down through tax audits and asset seizures. In Brazil, “Operation Car Wash” exposed a web of corruption worth over $5 billion, leading to hundreds of convictions. In South Korea, two former presidents were jailed for corruption and tax-related crimes tied to family conglomerates. Around the world, tax enforcement has proven to be the sharpest tool against corruption. In the Philippines, corruption drains ₱700 billion to ₱1.3 trillion annually (equivalent to 20% of the national budget, based on assessments cited by multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). From ghost projects and padded contracts to the misuse of confidential funds, taxpayers’ money is diverted to the private luxuries of the powerful. Political dynasties and their favored contractors thrive through joint ventures and undue influence, enriching themselves while ordinary Filipinos struggle. Meanwhile, social media flaunts their ill-gotten wealth — luxury cars, designer bags, million-peso lifestyles — far beyond what their declared incomes can justify. This is not just immoral. Under Philippine law, it is tax evasion, punishable by imprisonment, fines, and perpetual disqualification from public office. Transparency International’s 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranks the Philippines 114th out of 180 countries, behind peers in ASEAN like Malaysia (57th) and Vietnam (88th). Weak enforcement not only embarrasses the country globally, but it also undermines democracy at home. Corruption is more than theft — it is a failure in governance. It undermines the law, weakens democratic institutions, and erodes the moral foundation of society. If taxpayers see the corrupt escape accountability, voluntary compliance collapses. If foreign investors perceive dynasties enriching themselves through public funds, confidence erodes. Corruption acts like a hidden tax on investment, discouraging FDI and weakening economic growth. The consequence is clear: less revenue for the state, fewer jobs for the people, and weaker resilience for the future. To restore trust, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Commission on Elections, and the Office of the Ombudsman must: 1. Audit confidential funds and discretionary allocations. 2. Investigate joint ventures and contractors linked to political dynasties. 3. Scrutinize campaign donors who benefit from government contracts. 4. Prosecute relentlessly — not only contractors, but politicians and families who profit from corruption. 5. Enforce perpetual disqualification for convicted officials to end dynastic abuse. This is not just about punishing crimes. It is about spending taxes judiciously — not for the lavish lifestyles of the few, but for the urgent needs of the many: In my book, Reimagining the World Without Corruption, launched at Harvard Kennedy School, I argue that corruption is not only a political failure but an economic trap. It erodes public trust, deters investments, and worsens inequality. To break free, we must ensure that every peso collected serves the people — not political dynasties. A post shared by CSR Philippines (@csrphilippines) The global message is clear: Countries that hold the powerful accountable attract more investment and build stronger democracies. For the Philippines, the path forward is equally clear: follow the money, prosecute the guilty, and rebuild trust in governance.

"The Philippines’ widening flood-control corruption scandal — triggered by arrest warrants against former congressman Zaldy Co and senior Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) officials — has morphed into a systemic governance crisis that now implicates key figures across the legislative, political, and bureaucratic landscape. What began as a ₱289-million procurement anomaly has expanded into a broader indictment of the country’s fiscal-governance architecture, its opaque budget process, and the political economy that enable leakages in public-works spending. For global investors evaluating sovereign risk, the issue is no longer whether Zaldy Co would be arrested. It is now more of the structural configuration of governance failure — where policy architects, political brokers, contracting beneficiaries, and bureaucratic enablers appear entangled in one convergent breach of fiscal integrity. The addition of legislators to the constellation of bureaucrats linked to the scandal elevates the risk profile further. For markets, this signals not just individual misconduct but institutional permissiveness that corrodes public-expenditure predictability, procurement fairness, and long-horizon investment certainty. The scandal unfolds in the middle of the country’s infrastructure super-cycle — a critical phase under the Marcos Jr. administration’s “Build Better More” agenda, supported by multilateral lenders, bilateral financing, and increasing private-sector participation through hybrid Public-Private Partnership (PPP) models. Flood-control and DPWH spending have historically been hotspots for budget leakages, cost inflation, and execution failures. This scandal exposes structural weaknesses across three core governance risk pillars: 1. Fiscal Governance Alleged 2025 budget manipulation by senators Francis “Chiz” Escudero (specifically when he was Senate president), Joel Villanueva, and Jinggoy Estrada strikes at the credibility of fiscal planning — a key metric monitored by credit-rating agencies. 2. Procurement Integrity Zaldy Co’s dual posture as policymaker and contractor underscores the risks of embedded conflicts of interest and rigged procurement pathways. 3. Institutional Coordination DPWH regional involvement suggests systemic vulnerabilities inside a bureaucracy where flaunted political influence overrides prudent technical decision-making. For investors, these failures translate into higher cost of capital, longer project gestation, and elevated execution risk, particularly across infrastructure, the Philippines’ supposed growth engine. Global markets differentiate isolated corruption cases from structural governance breakdowns. The current scandal clearly falls into the latter category. Below is a governance-risk map showing how each implicated actor contributes to systemic vulnerability. Zaldy Co – Operational and contractual liability His case reflects the entrenched political-business networks that compromise the integrity of public procurement. Chiz Escudero – Policy-level liability Note: Markets assign significant weight to Escudero’s role because budget reliability is foundational to sovereign-risk evaluations. Joel Villanueva – Allocation and influence liability Note: This raises red flags on discretionary project allocation and political interference in appropriations. Jinggoy Estrada – Political-broker liability and pattern-risk amplifier While not yet the central political node, Estrada’s inclusion significantly escalates risk signals, for three reasons: Note: For foreign capital, Estrada’s emergence is not about personal guilt — it is about what it signals: that budget manipulation may be broader, more coordinated, and more institutionally embedded than initially assumed. The crisis now spans: This is the type of triangulated + political-broker failure pattern which I categorize as institutional weakness in sovereign-risk assessments. 1. Sovereign credit rating outlook A scandal implicating multiple senators and DPWH officials weakens the Philippines’ institutional-strength score and may introduce negative outlook bias if no systemic reforms are introduced. 2. Foreign direct investment hesitation Investors from Japan, Singapore, and the Middle East — major players in Philippine infrastructure — place heavy emphasis on transparent procurement. A scandal of this breadth may increase due-diligence cost and elevate required Interest Rate Risk (IRR). 3. PPP pipeline vulnerability Developers may demand risk premiums or defer participation altogether, weakening infrastructure rollout targets for PPPs. 4. Peso and bond market volatility Perceived political-governance risk can push up local bond spreads and increase currency volatility. 5. Infrastructure execution drag Investigations into DPWH offices and congressional participation can stall or halt regional flood-control and transport projects — directly affecting the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). From a global-investor perspective, the case now implicates: This is no longer a mere procurement scandal. It is a multi-faceted, governance-risk event with direct implications for sovereign creditworthiness, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, PPP viability, and long-term infrastructure performance. The arrest warrants issued against Co are not closure. They are evidence of structural vulnerabilities that require institutional reform, not cosmetic enforcement. Until the investigative lens expands beyond DPWH intermediaries and contractor-linked lawmakers, foreign investors will continue pricing the Philippines as a high political-governance-risk market, particularly in infrastructure, sovereign bonds, and other long-horizon assets. Below is a Rating-Agency Style Risk Matrix which Vantage Point tailored in the mold of sovereign analysts, institutional investors, and credit-rating committees. Here, I followed the structure typically used by Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch — categorizing risks into Institutional, Fiscal, Political, and Execution buckets, assigning severity levels, likelihood assessments, and potential rating implications RATING-AGENCY STYLE RISK MATRIX Philippines: Flood-Control Corruption Scandal – Governance & Sovereign Risk Assessment 1. Institutional Governance Risk 2. Fiscal Governance Risk 3. Political Stability & Policy Continuity Risk 4. Execution, Infrastructure & Procurement Risk OVERALL RISK SCORE (Rating-Agency Model) The multi-node liability indicates deep structural weaknesses in budget integrity, procurement governance, and institutional accountability. For foreign investors, the lesson is clear: The flood control scandal should be interpreted as evidence of a governance system that requires structural reform. Until the investigative focus expands beyond Co to include policy-level actors, investors will continue to price in elevated political-governance risk, particularly in infrastructure-linked asset classes and long-horizon capital deployments. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] Why global investors see PH flood control scandal as systemic red flag,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-global-investors-see-flood-control-corruption-philippines-red-flag/,Rappler
"(This is a press release from Kaya Founders.) Kaya Founders, a Philippines-based venture capital (VC) firm, announced on Tuesday, November 11, the successful final close of its US$25 million fund, marking a major milestone in Kaya’s mission to back the next generation of Filipino and regional founders building technology-driven solutions for the Philippines and Southeast Asia. Helmed by operators-turned-angel investors Paulo Campos (ex-CEO, Zalora Philippines), Lisa Gokongwei-Cheng (CEO, Summit Media), and Ray Alimurung (ex-CEO, Lazada Philippines), Kaya Founders is the Philippines’ most active early-stage VC fund in the Philippines today. Its second fund follows a stapled fund structure and includes the firm’s “Zero to One” Pre-seed Fund and its “One to Ten” Seed to Series A Fund. This two-pronged structure is designed to support founders from idea stage to growth scale. Investors into the fund include a diverse and strong mix of local and international partners such as Singapore-based Pavilion Capital, Boston-based hedge fund Bracebridge Capital, Chicago-based Concentric Equity Partners, alongside leading local family offices and technology operators. Kaya previously announced its partnership with local technology solutions provider AMTI in April 2023, who serves as an anchor investor in the fund. Founded in 2021, Kaya Founders has built a portfolio of over 40 startups across multiple sectors including e-commerce, fintech, education, healthcare, software-as-a-service, agriculture, and more. Notable investments include e-commerce enabler Etaily, which breached $100m in annualized revenue earlier this year; cloud logistics platform Locad, which secured a $9 million pre-Series B in November 2024; banking-as-a-service provider Netbank, which completed a Series A round led by BEENEXT; and PayMongo, one of the leading payments providers in the country backed by US fintech Stripe. With this second fund, Kaya Founders aims to back 10 to 20 additional startups across the Philippines and Southeast Asia over the next three years. In line with its continued focus on innovation for financial inclusion and sustainability, Kaya Founders has made new investments this past year in Datung, ProTech, LenderLink, and SunFund. These companies represent a growing wave of innovators advancing financial access, digital inclusion, and clean energy. Datung uses AI-powered credit scoring and community-based lending networks to provide fair financing for underserved MSMEs. ProTech offers affordable, embedded device protection through an insurtech model designed for emerging markets. LenderLink is building a credit data marketplace aggregating lenders and enabling borrowers to share their credit history. SunFund makes solar energy adoption accessible for households and SMEs through a monthly subscription model, accelerating the country’s shift toward a low-carbon economy. Kaya Founders’ announcement of its final close coincides with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Startup Venture Fund of the National Development Company (NDC), an investment arm of the Philippine government. The partnership builds on Kaya’s appointment as an official co-investment partner of the SVF and reflects the government’s continued commitment to deepen collaboration with the private sector. The strategic partnership aims to expand capital access for Filipino startups, igniting innovation, job creation and inclusive economic growth. The firm sees a strong opportunity for disciplined early stage investing as the regional funding environment normalizes and the Philippines start-up ecosystem continues to mature. With operational expertise and deep conviction in the local market, Kaya is well positioned to offer its investors differentiated access to the next generation of high growth companies and an attractive entry point into one of the region’s fastest growing tech ecosystems. Indeed, as global capital crowds into AI in the US and regional investors recalibrate in the wake of Indonesia’s governance crisis, a funding gap has opened up across Southeast Asia. For early-stage investors, this is a rare window. Kaya is doubling down on this whitespace — backing high-growth ventures across its core thematic areas: namely, “Frictionless Business”, the “New Filipino Consumer”, and “Embedded Credit”. A post shared by Kaya Founders (@kayafounders) The firm believes that these areas will define the region’s next wave of category leaders, and offer its LPs one of the most compelling avenues for returns in the decade ahead. “At Kaya, we’ve always believed in building the future we want to see. This fund close is more than a milestone—it’s a vote of confidence in that vision. At a time when investor sentiment in Southeast Asia’s tech ecosystem is being tested, we’re doubling down on the Philippines. We see an exciting market brimming with talent, ambition, and untapped opportunities for company-building.

In resolutions dated November 26, the SEC Enforcement and Investor Protection Department canceled the certificates of incorporation of St. Timothy Construction Corporation and St. Gerrard Construction General Contractor and Development Corporation. The two firms were also ordered to pay a penalty of P2 million each. Their directors were further disqualified from being a director, trustee, or officer of any corporation for five years. The corporate watchdog cited a Senate blue ribbon committee hearing on September 1, when Sarah Discaya admitted she was the owner and officer of St. Timothy and St. Gerrard. The SEC noted that Discaya’s involvement was not disclosed in St. Timothy’s beneficial ownership declarations from 2022 to September 2025, and St. Gerrard’s from 2022 to 2024. Discaya said in April that she divested from St. Timothy in 2018. “The failure of St. Timothy and St. Gerrard to disclose [Discaya] as their beneficial owner constituted a violation of SEC MC No. 15, Series of 2019, as amended by MC No. 10, Series of 2022, which required companies to submit their beneficial ownership information as part of their general information sheets,” the SEC explained. The corporate regulator also noted that it gave both companies 15 calendar days to explain their side, but neither complied with this. According to a report by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, the Discayas’ nine construction firms bagged 421 government projects worth P31 billion. St. Timothy and Alpha & Omega — another Discaya firm — were among the top 15 contractors of flood control projects nationwide. – Rappler.com",True,true,SEC revokes 2 Discaya firms’ registration over false ownership information,https://www.rappler.com/business/sec-revokes-registration-discaya-saint-timothy-gerrard-construction/,Rappler
"The 13th-month pay is one of the most anticipated benefits for Filipino workers, serving as a mandatory, much-needed boost before the holidays. Understanding how it’s calculated and its tax implications is key to ensure employees are informed and can plan effectively for the season. The 13th-month pay is a mandatory benefit for all rank-and-file employees in the private sector who have worked for at least one month during the calendar year, as mandated by Presidential Decree No. 851. The computation is straightforward: it is equivalent to one-twelfth (1/12) of the total basic salary an employee earned during the calendar year. Pro-Rated Computation: If you have not worked for the full 12 months (e.g., you started mid-year, resigned, or were terminated), you are still entitled to a pro-rated 13th-month pay based on the total basic salary earned from your start date up to the date of computation or separation. The basic salary includes all remuneration or earnings paid by an employer to an employee for services rendered. It is the regular or fixed compensation for services, but generally excludes supplementary benefits. A significant benefit of the 13th-month pay in the Philippines is its non-taxable status up to a certain limit under the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law, or Republic Act 10963. Currently, the 13th-month pay and other benefits (like Christmas bonuses, productivity incentives, and other benefits not considered “de minimis”) are exempt from income tax up to a maximum aggregate amount of P90,000. This tax shield ensures that the majority of working Filipinos receive their full 13th-month pay, putting more cash directly into their pockets for year-end expenses. While the current law provides some relief, a proposed legislative measure aims to provide even greater financial comfort to Filipino workers. Senator Win Gatchalian’s GINHAWA Act (Granting Increase in Take-Home Pay for All Working Filipinos Act) is a bill seeking to expand tax exemptions for working Filipinos and is currently being deliberated in Congress. It is important to note that the GINHAWA Bill is a proposal, and its provisions are not yet law, nor are they enforceable. If the GINHAWA Bill were passed into law, it would bring about the following major changes that directly impact an employee’s take-home pay: The GINHAWA Bill, therefore, complements the existing 13th-month pay law by aiming to make not just the mandatory year-end benefit but also other earnings, especially those compensating for risky or extended work hours, substantially or fully tax-exempt. For all Filipino employees, staying informed about these benefits and proposed reforms is essential to secure the maximum benefit from their hard-earned income. The 13th-month pay, coupled with potential reforms like the GINHAWA Act, truly embodies the spirit of giving back to the country’s workforce. – Rappler.com ACG is the most trusted tax advisory firm in the Philippines, providing tax strategy, compliance, and policy advisory services to multinational corporations, foreign investors, and government institutions.

"LA UNION, Philippines – Inside the new SM City La Union, the noise of modern life never stops. The music blares from speakers of different stores, each trying to outdo the other and pull passersby inside; the chatter of thousands of mall-goers fills the air; the shrieks of children echo as they run past food kiosks; and the familiar piped in jingle: “Here at Essss Emmmm, we’ve got it all for you!” But turn a corner, and you’ll find a store that seems to breathe at a slower rhythm. Inside Arkus Balay, the light bends differently. It slips through the weave of bamboo pendant lamps, the kind you might see in an upscale resort in Thailand, in a magazine spread of a resthouse in Tagaytay, or in a café that mixes modern design with local texture. Each handcrafted piece looks alive: rattan-crocheted pottery wrapped in lattice, wall trays patterned like woven constellations, towering teardrop vases that stretch up to six feet tall, and traditional diamond-and-cross patterns woven into a bolero made of inabel fabric. Each one shows the marks of the hands that shaped it. Amid this forest of craftsmanship stands Mandrake Palabay, one-half of the daring couple behind the brand. He points to the ceiling, a canopy of lamps: spherical, conical, some fringed like sea grass. “That’s the u-ong lamp,” he said, referring to the mushroom-shaped ceiling lamps. “The weaver moves around the piece, not the other way around.” It’s among his favorite innovations. It’s a design that taught his weavers to think differently, to follow the rhythm of their hands instead of forcing the form. Unlike most designers, he has never studied design. Yet the space he built inside this mall feels like a pause button — a place where craftsmanship slows down what the world keeps speeding up. Mandrake grew up in San Fernando City in La Union, in a family where principles came before comfort. His father, Crisanto Palabay, was an activist tortured during the Marcos dictatorship. His uncles Romulo and Armando were killed for their activism. Their names are on the Bantayog ng mga Bayani, listed among those who stood up to power. “Their courage was on another level,” Mandrake says. “I’m just persistent.” A post shared by 11,103 (@11103.film) Where his father and uncles fought through speeches and marches, Mandrake would fight through craft and continuity. Heritage, too, must be defended, he believes. His father had three rules: never steal, never cheat, never complain about work. “Even when you retire,” his father told him, “you’ll still wash your own dishes, do the laundry, clean the house.” To his activist father, work was not a burden, but a way of life. So when Mandrake, a computer science graduate, left for Hong Kong in his twenties to work as a domestic helper, he carried that lesson with him. He called this season his stepping stone, a way to test opportunities and see what he could learn. His employer tagged him along during a visit to a businessman friend’s showroom. Bored while waiting, Mandrake roamed the vast retail space for artificial flowers and home accents. He started fixing displays. The businessman noticed. A year after, when Mandrake was back in the Philippines, the showroom owner in Hong Kong called with a job offer: Complete a product catalogue that buyers all over the world can refer to. Mandrake didn’t know a thing about design, photography, catalogue-making. He said yes anyway. He remembered what his Uncle Peter, a Swiss man married to his aunt, once told him: “To do a job properly, you need the right tools. You can’t tighten a screw with a knife or scissors.” The newly minted catalogue maker asked for a good camera. “If the pictures were bad, I’d have no excuse.” That habit of saying yes to new work and arming himself with the tools became his way forward. It’s how he learned, advanced, and reinvented himself. Mandrake worked for that Hong Kong-based boss for ten years. The company factories in Sri Lanka , Hong Kong, and Myanmar produced handwoven home products for exports. He learned about proportion and balance while arranging displays. He learned to sell through photographs and catalogues. Later, he joined the design department. “I usually start with the material,” he says. “Can it bend? Twist? Fold? Once I know that, I imagine what it can become: baskets, trays, containers. Then I draw, measure, and sit down with a weaver to make the first sample.” He was exposed to other designs when they joined international trade fairs. His wife Jackie later joined him, handling costing and logistics, checking if sourcing and producing the products made business sense. If it’s an artificial flower, Jackie checked the cost of each petal, stick, leaf. “That’s where I learned to balance creativity with practicality,” Mandrake says. A work mentor once told him: “If you do a job, do it correctly the first time.” Mandrake took that to heart. “That means studying before you start,” he says. “Learn from others’ mistakes so you don’t waste time or materials.” After a decade of working in factories in Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, he moved to a lighting company in Myanmar. “Chandeliers made of crystals,” he says, laughing. “I didn’t know lighting, but I said yes again.” This new work tested him. “Some designs looked good on paper, then bad in real life,” he says. “Some never went into production.” When the pandemic hit, factories closed, orders stopped, and his salary was cut in half. After 18 years abroad, Mandrake returned to La Union for good. Mandrake and Jackie asked a simple question to guide their next move: What do we know how to do, and who can we do it with? They joined trade fairs, learned about the state of rattan bamboo, and local fabric supplies, as well as the skillsets of local weavers. The old weavers were still at their looms, but they were stuck making the same baskets, blankets, mirrors, and trays that filled souvenir stalls for decades. “They had no product developers,” Mandrake says. “No one to push them to try something new.” The craft celebrated in other countries is tired and dying here. So he started visiting them in the towns of Bangar, Bacnotan, and the quieter barangays in the hills of Abra, Ilocos, and other areas his late uncles had roamed in the 1970s and stayed in while fighting an oppressive government. He showed the weavers his sketches. They hesitated. The new shapes looked odd, the designs unfamiliar. Mandrake understood their fear. Change, in small towns, often feels like betrayal. So he found another way to persuade them: he paid them more. He told them he already had orders, even when he didn’t. He ordered sample after sample, storing them in his own warehouse, just to keep the faith alive. “It was hard,” he says. “But I wanted to prove we could make something different.” In 2022, he opened the first Arkus Balay showroom and outlet in San Fernando, along the highway where tourists from surf town San Juan and other northern travel spots pass as they drive back to Manila. He went full blast on social media, gathering interest and orders from buyers from Ilocos all the way to Tagaytay. Back in the weaving communities, he showed them photos of pendant lamps hanging on hotel lounges, hand-braided baskets used as accents in a posh living rooms. “It changed the energy. It gave them pride,” he beams. “Now they’re the ones asking for new designs.” Not everything sold. “Sometimes you make something and no one wants it,” he says. “Then a few months later, everyone is looking for it. You just have to keep creating.” He laughs. “People don’t always know what they want until they see it.” “La Union craft still lacks exposure,” he adds. “Only now are we starting to gain traction through exhibits and government programs. Before, other places took credit for our work. Even the brooms sold in Baguio, many are made here in La Union.” He doesn’t say this with bitterness, only resolve. “We want to capture the higher market so we can pay the weavers what they deserve,” he adds. “So we focus on quality and design. That’s how we set ourselves apart.” It is, in its own way, activism through craft. A campaign to restore dignity to handmade work and make communities believe again in what their hands can create. “If this craft dies,” he says, “the communities lose their identity.” Before SM City La Union opened its glass doors, Mandrake and Jackie weren’t sure they wanted to be part of it. They already have a thriving roadside studio shop. In the mall, everything would be brighter, faster, noisier. “It was a difficult decision,” Mandrake says. “We knew it would be exposure, but also a big risk.” They initially said no. The numbers didn’t add up. Rent was steep, and SM also took a share of their sales. Not long after, SM called again with a better offer. Once more, Mandrake and Jackie faced the choice between comfort and courage. They said yes. “We put almost all our savings here,” he says. “That’s how we are. Either go full blast, or don’t do it at all.” Two weeks after opening, “sales have been good,” he says, encouraged. Some days, he still doubts. “If it doesn’t work, it’s ok. We’ve failed before.” But the moments when people ask about the lamps or the baskets keep him going. “Those small conversations make me think it’s worth it,” he says. “You realize you’re not just selling things to buyers. You’re reminding the weavers where they came from.” At 50 square meters, the SM branch is small compared to their showroom outside, but it represented something larger. This is a test of whether authenticity could survive commercial speed. Their neighbors are national and global: UNIQLO, Mannam, Philip Stein, Kultura, Toy Kingdom, Miniso, and more. To Mandrake, Arkus Balay’ advantage was something no brand could replicate: proximity to the maker. “We deal directly with the communities. We know the weaver. We know the story.” For him, the mall wasn’t just a business move. It was an experiment in visibility, a statement that La Union’s handmade heritage deserved the same spotlight as imported goods. “If you don’t try,” he says, “you’ll never know.” At 48, Mandrake no longer dreams of becoming a global brand. What he wants is continuity: that the next generation of La Union weavers will still know the rhythm of their hands. Inside Arkus Balay, that rhythm is visible everywhere: in the weaved fabric, bamboo, or rattan that tightens and loosens like breath, in the trays stacked like ripples, in the pendant lamps that throw soft light across the walls. Each piece carries persistence and trial, the proof that beauty can come from things that almost failed. It’s a store that feels like a home that remembers where it came from. When asked what he learned from years abroad, he says, “There’s no such thing as luck. You have to study, research, know your market and your price. Most of all, listen to your customers. Timing and opportunity come rarely, but when they do, you have to be ready.” He looks around the store. “What I learned from my family is to stand for something.” In a mall filled with chain stores and glass displays, Arkus Balay feels like a small resistance: one built not on slogans, but on craftsmanship. Mandrake calls it “making things that are sustainable, natural, ethical, local.” But really, he’s been building something else all along: a living argument that conviction can be inherited, and beauty can be its expression. – Rappler.com",True,true,Arkus Balay: The craft of conviction,https://www.rappler.com/business/inside-arkus-balay-handicraft-store-sm-city-la-union/,Rappler
"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Francisco Ed. Lim issued last week a draft circular for comments from the public until October 15 to address the continuing threat posed by the present structure of tenure of independent directors with respect to the exercise of their objectivity and independence. This new rule is to take effect on January 1, 2026. Under Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 4, Series of 2017, which is SEC’s current applicable regulation on the subject, independent directors may serve for a maximum cumulative term of nine years. After reaching this nine-year limit, they are permanently — as in perpetually — barred from serving in that capacity for that company. However, individuals who have served as independent directors can still be elected as non-independent directors in the same company after they have served the nine-year term limit or as independent directors in a different company, provided they meet the requirements for those roles. In the instance that a company wants to retain an independent director who has served for nine years, the board of directors of the company may appeal the matter to the SEC, at the same time, provide a “meritorious justification/s and seek shareholders’ approval during the annual shareholders’ meeting.” These rules do not only apply to independent directors of publicly listed companies but to all private companies and registered issuers. The basis for counting the maximum cumulative nine-year term of the independent directors under the current rules was from 2012, with any fraction of a year served counted as a full year. Independent directors are not also necessarily elected annually. Their election can be structured in a staggered basis like one, two, or three years. In this way, their positions do not expire all at the same time. Previous to SEC MC No. 4, Series of 2017, the governing rule on the duration and term limit for independent directors was covered by SEC MC No. 9, Series of 2011, otherwise known as the “5-2-5” rule. Under the “5-2-5” rule, independent directors can serve for five consecutive years. After completion of the five-year period, the independent director shall be ineligible for election. The independent directors have to undergo a “cooling-off” period of two years. During this time, they must not be engaged in any activity that would disqualify them from being an independent director in the company. After the cooling-off period, the same independent directors may be again re-elected for the next final five-year period — for a maximum total of 10 years. Under the upcoming changes, the SEC will continue to adopt the policy in which companies may elect independent directors with different terms. The reason behind this staggered approach is obviously to ensure that not all positions expire in the same year, providing stability to the board. As illustrated in the draft circular, this is how the position of independent directors is filled up on a staggered basis: if a company has five independent directors, the company may opt to elect two nominees with 3-year terms, another two nominees with 2-year terms, with the last nominee for a term of one year. After a year, the one with a one-year term will expire and a new independent director will be elected for a three-year term. At the end of the second year, two positions will also expire and two new independent directors will be elected for three-year term; and so on. The draft circular is likewise moving towards the continuation of the three-year fixed term for independent directors with a maximum cumulative period term limit of nine years (reckoned from 2012 as provided under SEC Memorandum Circular No. 19, series of 2016, and SEC Memorandum Circular No. 24, series of 2019). The three-year fixed term cuts off the practice of indefinite reappointments that can weaken the objectivity of independent directors, as well their independence. Again, any fraction of a year shall be considered as one full year, regardless of the manner or reason by which the position of an independent director was relinquished or vacated. Moreover, independent directors who fail to maintain their qualifications and/or has become disqualified at the time of serving their term, they are required to immediately vacate their position. The possible penalties for companies that violate any of the mandatory provisions of these upcoming changes will be subject to a basic fine of P1 million for non-adoption of the three-year fixed term for independent directors, P1 million basic fine for breach of the term limit of nine years plus P100,000 fine monthly until the violation is cured, and P1 million plus P100,000 monthly penalty for failure to vacate upon disqualification. In the draft circular, too, independent directors will be essentially elected for a three-year term up to a total of three terms equivalent to nine years, and their position is filled during the annual meeting when that term expires. Independent director positions should have different terms, so some may expire one year and others the next. Lim is optimistic that the new structure of tenure for independent directors will promote good governance. He is also confident that with the proposed changes, independent directors are protected from sudden removal when they fight for something which they believe is right even if it is not consistent with what the controlling shareholders are thinking. With the strict capping of the maximum term limit of independent directors at nine years, Lim expects that this will give other companies the opportunity to benefit from their expertise. At the same time, this will generally foster the use of more available talents, too. But come to think of it, despite all this present effort to support independent directors to fortify their position against compromised decision-making, records continue to show that their role in providing an effective solution in the fight against questionable internal management pressure that has led to poor financial performance or even outright business failure still continues to be elusive. – Rappler.com (The article has been prepared for general circulation for the reading public and must not be construed as an offer, or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or financial instruments whether referred to herein or otherwise.

"MANILA, Philippines — Senator Robin Padilla is pushing for stiffer penalties against violators of the Safe Spaces Act or Bawal Bastos Act of 2019. On Wednesday, September 24, Padilla filed Senate Bill No. 2810, which seeks to amend the Safe Spaces Act of 2019 with heavier penalties, as well as increasing the prescriptive period for filing a complaint from the current five years to 10 years. Padilla, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Public Information and Mass Media, cited that the committee’s recent hearings on the policies of television networks and artist management agencies in relation to complaints of sexual abuse and harassment have found that the “sexual harassment in the workplace remains active and rampant.” “It was further observed that employers, particularly large corporations, could easily evade compliance with their obligations under the Safe Spaces Act given the grossly small amount of applicable fines,” Padilla said in his bill. Among the amendments that Padilla proposed in SB 2810 include: This is the third and latest bill that Padilla filed following the committee’s series of hearings on sexual harassment cases in the entertainment industry. The probe led by Padilla was launched following the reported sexual harassment incident involving actor Sandro Muhlach. In August, Padilla filed Senate Bill No. 2777, which seeks to make sexual assault punishable by reclusion perpetua to the death penalty for cases with aggravating circumstances, regardless of the gender of the offender. He also filed Senate Bill No. 2778 which aims to professionalize the talent management industry and require licenses for talent managers and companies. Padilla also mentioned during the Wednesday hearing that the Senate Committee on Public Information and Mass Media has decided to cancel the Senate probe on Muhlach’s case to stop sensationalizing the issue. “Pero siyempre, hindi po natin isinasantabi ang mga reklamong ito. Tayo po ay nakapaglinaw ng mga panukala para sagutin po, ito na po ang magiging panangga… Ito na po ang magiging sandigan ninyo kung ito po ay magiging batas,” Padilla said. (But of course, we won’t put aside the complaints. We were able to set clear amendments, which will be our shield. We can lean on these if these amendments lapse into law.)

"STOCKHOLM, Sweden – Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt won the 2025 Nobel economics prize for their work on how innovation and the forces of “creative destruction” can drive economic growth and lift living standards across the globe. Their research explains how technology gives rise to new products and production methods which replace old ones, resulting in a better standard of living, health, and quality of life. “Over the last two centuries, for the first time in history, the world has seen sustained economic growth. This has lifted vast numbers of people out of poverty and laid the foundation of our prosperity,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said in a statement. The laureates have also shown that such progress cannot be taken for granted, the Academy said, while two of the prize winners highlighted that US President Donald Trump’s trade policies would impinge on growth. “Economic stagnation, not growth, has been the norm for most of human history. Their work shows that we must be aware of, and counteract, threats to continued growth,” the Academy said. While most economists view economic growth as a driver of prosperity, there are some who do not see it as an unalloyed good. The 2024 economics prize was won by Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson for work on inequality and Johnson in particular has pointed to how the benefits of technological innovation can be skewed toward powerful elites. There is also a fierce debate about what level of growth is sustainable in light of man-made climate change and environmental degradation. The prestigious award, formally known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, is the final prize to be given out this year and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2 million). Mokyr, a professor at Northwestern University in the United States, was awarded half the prize. Aghion, a professor at the College de France and INSEAD in Paris and at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and Howitt, a professor at Brown University in the United States, shared the other half. The award comes at a potential inflection point for the global economy with many expecting artificial intelligence to spark a new growth spurt. It also highlights the strategic risks for Europe of falling further behind the United States and China on technologies of the future as well as the potential costs of barriers to global trade. Speaking by phone at the press conference, Aghion said de-globalization and tariff barriers were “obstacles to growth,” adding that the bigger the market, the more possibilities to exchange ideas, transfer technologies, and for healthy competition. “Anything that gets in the way of openness is an obstacle to growth. So I see there kind of dark clouds currently accumulating, pushing for barriers to trade and openness,” he said. Aghion called on Europe to learn from the US and China, which he said have found ways to reconcile competition and industrial policy. “In Europe, in the name of competition policy, we became very anti any form of industrial policy. I think we need to evolve on that and find ways to reconcile industrial policy in areas like defense, climate, AI, biotech,” he said. Howitt, who said he had been “absolutely stunned” by the award, was also critical of President Trump’s trade policies. “It’s pretty clear that these are going to discourage innovation by reducing what we call the scale effect,” he told Reuters. “Starting a tariff war just reduces the size of the market for everybody.” He said that trying to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US could perhaps make some political sense but was not good economic policy. “We’re good at designing running shoes, but it’s best for us to leave others to make them,” he said. The awards for medicine, physics, chemistry, peace, and literature were announced last week. Those prizes were established in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been handed out since 1901, with a few interruptions mostly due to the world wars. The economics prize was established much later, being given out first in 1969 when it was won by Norway’s Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen from the Netherlands for work in dynamic economic modeling. Tinbergen’s brother Nikolaas also won a prize, taking home Medicine in 1973. While few economists are household names, relatively well-known winners include former US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, and Paul Krugman and Milton Friedman. – Rappler.com $1 = 9.5112 Swedish crowns",True,true,"Trio win Nobel economics prize for work on innovation, growth, and ‘creative destruction’",https://www.rappler.com/business/winners-nobel-prize-economic-sciences-2025/,Rappler
"Finance Secretary Frederick Go and newly appointed Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Commissioner Charlito Martin Mendoza have jointly announced that the tax agency was freezing all field audits and halting the issuance of every Letter of Authority (LOA) and Mission Order (MO) throughout the country. For decades, LOAs have been the most feared instruments in Philippine tax administration — capable of interrupting business operations, delaying investments, and dragging even compliant taxpayers into months of costly negotiations. To suspend them entirely was a sign that something deep inside the institution had broken. The government, through the Finance department under Go explained that taxpayers had raised concerns about LOAs which could no longer be dismissed. Go says the nation’s tax base — millions of workers, entrepreneurs, and corporations — deserved honest, predictable, and professional audits. Those qualities, he implied, had not always been present. Mendoza then formalized the freeze, directing all regional, district, and special audit units to stop issuing LOAs, except in the narrow cases allowed by law. A technical working group would begin reengineering the audit process from the ground up. Mendoza told the Senate blue ribbon committee that , moving forward, every single LOA will require the commissioner’s personal approval. Under the current system, LOAs were issued freely at the regional level, with virtually no central oversight. Regional directors exercised “absolute authority,” Mendoza said, and the documents never reached the commissioner’s desk. That decentralization, in practice, had created thousands of opportunities for manipulation. Mendoza now plans to restrict the number of LOAs a taxpayer can receive and to embed these controls inside an integrated digital system — an attempt to use technology as a buffer between enforcement and abuse. The need for such reforms became clear when Senators JV Ejercito and Erwin Tulfo revealed that revenue officers were allegedly siphoning off as much as 70%of LOA collections. (READ: Erwin Tulfo seeks Senate probe into alleged BIR extortion scheme) On paper, the BIR projected six to eight billion pesos annually from LOA-driven assessments. In reality, only two to three billion pesos reached the Treasury. The balance, lawmakers alleged, vanished into kickbacks. These were not isolated complaints. Ejercito disclosed that even European and American ambassadors had been reporting LOA-related harassment, suggesting that the LOA system had metastasized into a national reputational risk. Former BIR Commissioner Kim Henares took a contrasting position, reminding lawmakers that LOAs — when used properly — are essential tools for tax enforcement. She pointed to an internal study showing that the Philippines loses roughly ₱1 trillion in uncollected taxes each year due to evasion, under declaration, and non-filing. Without LOAs, she argued, the BIR’s ability to pursue these gaps would be severely constrained. But she also conceded that during her tenure, she imposed strict oversight on LOA issuance, limiting them as part of her audit plan. Her point was nuanced: LOAs are indispensable in theory, but in practice require tight guardrails that the institution later abandoned. The tension between these two views captures the core of the crisis. LOAs are indeed necessary for tax enforcement — but only in a tax system designed to minimize discretion. In the Philippines, LOAs became the gateway to subjective audits that hinge on disputing expenses, questioning accounting treatments, and interpreting cost structures. This structural flaw explains why LOAs became both indispensable and corruptible at the same time. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) has repeatedly documented what this looks like in the real world in complaints filed against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR). In Puregold Price Club, Inc. v. CIR (CTA EB No. 1653), the BIR issued a substantial assessment based on alleged discrepancies in cost of sales, supplier rebates, and inventory variances. The CTA later voided large portions of the assessment, ruling that they were speculative and unsupported by competent evidence. The story repeated itself in Rustan Supercenters, Inc. v. CIR (CTA Case No. 8868), where the BIR disallowed expenses tied to spoilage, promotional discounts, and merchandising operations. Again, the CTA invalidated the bulk of the assessment because the BIR relied on flawed worksheets rather than substantiated documentation. These cases demonstrate the real problem: the issue is not the LOA itself — it is the architecture of net-income taxation system, which requires BIR examiners to scrutinize and dispute expense categories that are inherently subjective. A system that compels revenue officers to interpret depreciation, challenge inventory losses, or second-guess supplier rebates will always be vulnerable to abuse. Even if Mendoza approves every LOA personally, the audit process that follows remains grounded in interpretation, not objectivity. The answer is that these reforms will help, but they cannot cure the structural defect. Centralizing LOA approval may reduce the number of frivolous or predatory audits. A digital system may create a digital trail that deters some forms of misconduct. Limiting the frequency with which a taxpayer can be audited may provide relief for businesses previously hounded by multiple, overlapping LOAs. These are meaningful improvements — but they are improvements applied to a system whose core design invites abusive interpretation. The real issue is not how many LOAs are issued or who signs them. It is what the LOA allows examiners to do once they have it. The only sustainable way to break the LOA corruption cycle is to eliminate the gray zones that LOAs exploit. And that requires moving away from a net income taxation regime where tax liability depends on the BIR’s interpretation of expenses. Vantage Point sees a need for the Philippines to revisit gross income-based taxation, where audits focus on gross receipts — objective, measurable, digitizable — and no longer hinge on questioning spoilage rates, depreciation schedules, supplier rebates, or promotional discounts. In other emerging economies, including India, Mexico, and Indonesia, simplified gross-based or presumptive taxation vastly reduced audit disputes, increased voluntary compliance, and strengthened taxpayer confidence. Businesses paid predictable taxes instead of being forced to navigate negotiations. Governments collected more revenue with fewer confrontations. Oversight became easier because discretion shrank. Here, I believe that the same transformation is possible. The government now possesses the big data infrastructure necessary to compute industry-specific gross-income tax rates with accuracy. Artificial intelligence can refine these models annually, ensuring fairness even in industries with volatile margins. Gross receipts can be verified across digital payment channels, bank reports, and third-party data sources, removing much of the subjective interaction between examiners and taxpayers. This is why the suspension of LOAs — dramatic as it may be — should be seen not as the solution, but as the opening act of a deeper reform. The BIR does not simply need fewer LOAs or more oversight. It needs a tax system that does not oblige examiners and taxpayers into interpretive battles. It needs a structure that reduces human discretion and relies instead on transparent, objective metrics. Requiring the Commissioner’s approval may slow the abuse. Limiting the number of LOAs may protect some taxpayers. A digital system may bring order to a chaotic process. But none of these measures changes the fundamental truth that net-income taxation is a model built for negotiation, and negotiation is the soil in which corruption thrives. Gross-income taxation is not just a superior alternative — it is now the only credible antidote. And in an era where 70% of LOA collections reportedly vanish before reaching the Treasury, anything less than structural change risks repeating the failures that brought the system to the brink. The Philippines must decide whether to keep repairing a broken machine or replace it with one built for transparency. The answer, I believe, is increasingly clear. – Rappler.com Click here for more Vantage Point articles.",True,true,"[Vantage Point] After BIR freezes LOAs, should PH revisit gross-income taxation?",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-bir-freeze-letters-of-authority-philippines-revisit-gross-income-taxation/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The media and academic communities mourned the death of veteran business journalist Cai Ordinario, who passed away on Monday, November 17, at the age of 45. Ordinario, who reported on macroeconomic and urban development issues for BusinessMirror, died after her bout with cancer, according to BusinessMirror. “BusinessMirror mourns the passing of our senior reporter, Cai Ordinario — an award-winning journalist and dedicated educator whose work illuminated truths and inspired countless students and colleagues. Her legacy of sharp reporting, mentorship, and unwavering commitment to public service will continue to guide and uplift the communities she touched,” BusinessMirror said in a statement on Wednesday, November 19. Ordinario completed her journalism degree at the University of Santo Tomas (UST), where she was news editor of the Varsitarian, in 2022, and her Masters in Communication Research at the University of the Philippines in 2019. Ordinario first worked for the Manila Times before moving to BusinessMirror. She was a business reporter for Rappler in 2012, then returned to BusinessMirror less than a year later. The work of Ordinario, a former president of the Economic Journalist’s Association of the Philippines, had been recognized by award-giving bodies and government agencies, including the Philippine Statistics Authority. Ordinario won in PSA’s 2013 National Statistics Month (NSM) Media Awards for her Rappler story that used government statistics to explain the incidence of poverty in the country and to visualize where the poorest provinces are. She also won three consecutive PSA citations for Best Statistical Reporting in Print Media for her BusinessMirror reports from 2020 to 2022. “Her legacy of excellence and integrity will continue to inspire those in the fields of journalism and statistics,” the PSA said in a statement on Wednesday. “With Cai’s passing, the PSA has lost a steadfast ally in ensuring truth and balance in the reporting of national statistics and economic issues. It has been a privilege for us to collaborate with her.” The Department of Economy, Planning and Development, which selected Ordinario as DEPDev’s Outstanding Reporter for 2024, described her as a “brilliant and dedicated journalist whose work illuminated complex economic and development issues with clarity and insight.” “Her ability to translate technical matters into compelling stories empowered the public to better understand the forces shaping our nation,” DEPDev said. “DEPDev honors her invaluable contributions to economic journalism, marked by accuracy, integrity, and a profound sense of responsibility. Through her reporting on the economy, development challenges, and the lived realities of Filipinos, she not only informed but elevated public discourse, embodying the highest ideals of her profession,” it added. Ordinario is not only a veteran journalist but also a beloved educator. “The UP CMC honors Cai Ordinario as a colleague, mentor, and friend. Her passing is a profound loss to the academic and media communities, but her legacy endures in the countless students she inspired and the stories she courageously told,” the UP College of Media and Communication (UP-CMC) said in a statement on Wednesday, November 19. Odinario was a lecturer at the UP Department of Journalism on business journalism “and mentored students to approach economic reporting with both analytical precision and social conscience,” the UP-CMC said. “As a veteran economic reporter for BusinessMirror, she distinguished herself through incisive coverage of macroeconomic policy and trade, earning recognition for her clarity, rigor, and courage in exposing systemic issues that shaped national discourse,” UP-CMC said. “Her colleagues and students remember her not only for her professional excellence but also for her generosity of spirit. She guided young journalists with patience and insight, reminding them that journalism is a public trust and a service to the people. Her presence in the classroom and newsroom was marked by humility, warmth, and an unwavering commitment to truth,” it added. Ordinario also taught journalism in her alma mater, UST, which honored her “legacy of journalistic excellence,” citing her Hall of Fame award in the Bright Leaf Agriculture Journalism Awards. The UST Faculty of Arts and Letters said: “With her vast experience in the field, she generously poured her knowledge into every lesson, thus preparing her students to pursue their craft diligently and purposefully. You will be dearly missed, Ma’am Cai.” The UST Journalism Society mourned the death of Ordinario. “A journalist who embodied excellence and kindness, Ma’am Cai is someone who will truly be missed by many…. Her teachings and friendship will live on,” it said. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Veteran journalist, beloved educator Cai Ordinario dies at 45",https://www.rappler.com/people/obituary-journalist-educator-cai-ordinario/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Allowances for public health workers (PHWs) are subject to other conditions, the Commission on Audit emphasized as it affirmed with finality its January 31, 2020 decision upholding the notice of disallowance (ND) it issued to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth). The ND came after PhilHealth gave its employees cash perks — hazard pay, subsistence allowance, and laundry allowance — totaling P95.462 million in 2014. The state insurer sought to have its ND lifted. Jose Mari Tolentino, senior vice president of PhilHealth’s legal sector, said the Supreme Court classified the state insurer’s personnel as PHWs and are therefore entitled to certain cash perks under the National Health Insurance Act (RA No. 7875). However, PhilHealth’s motion for reconsideration was denied by COA last week, with the Commission saying the state insurer was merely rehashing old arguments that have already been considered and overruled. “It is the consistent position of this Commission that even if they are PHWs, the entitlement to the benefits is not absolute as it is subject to the other conditions under RA No. 7305 or the Magna Carta of PHWs and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR),” the 15-page COA ruling read. For a PHW to qualify for hazard pay, they must be assigned in hospitals or health facilities that handle contagious or communicable diseased, working within radiation-exposed areas, chemical and medical laboratories working on infectious specimen, conflict zones, or correction and drug rehabilitation centers where there may be risks of physical harm. Subsistence allowance, meanwhile, is only given to PHWs who are on-call “at any and all times” while assigned to a government hospital or any government institution. “The [High] Court has previously discussed that the award of WESA (welfare support allowance) or subsistence allowance is not a blanket award to PHWs and that it is granted only to those who meet the requirements of RA No. 7305 and its IRR, and thus, a sweeping grant of the same justifies its disallowance,” the Commission said. Meanwhile, laundry allowance is only given to PHWs who work in health-related establishments. – Rappler.com",True,true,COA: Allowances for public health workers are subject to conditions,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/coa-allowances-public-health-workers-subject-conditions/,Rappler

"As Filipinos continue to grapple with the rising cost of living, calls for a tax holiday have resurfaced as a supposed quick fix to ease economic burdens. While well-intentioned, a tax holiday is neither equitable nor sustainable. It offers temporary relief at the expense of long-term fiscal stability, benefiting only a limited segment of society while eroding much-needed government revenues. According to the 2024 Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Annual Report, the total withholding tax on compensation amounts to ₱364.45 billion. This represents 23.78% of the total income tax collection, which is ₱1.53 trillion, and 47.66% of the total individual income tax collection, which stands at ₱764.63 billion. These figures highlight the significant contribution of salary-based income taxes to the country’s overall tax revenue, highlighting the importance of compensation-based taxes in the Philippines’ fiscal system. If the proposed one-month income tax holiday for employees is implemented, it is estimated to result in a revenue loss of more than ₱33 billion. This highlights the fiscal impact of the measure, which would reduce government funds for crucial public services and infrastructure, even though it offers short-term relief for workers. In 2024, there were 23.64 million registered compensation earners in the Philippines falling into different income groups. Around 13.90 million workers (59%) are considered low-income earners, earning ₱250,000 or less annually, and are thus already exempt from income tax under the current law. Meanwhile, 9.69 million workers (41%) belong to the middle-income groups, including the lower-middle, middle-middle, upper-middle, and upper-income brackets, and are subject to withholding tax (i.e., 15 to 30%) on their salaries. Only a small fraction, approximately 71,000 workers (0.3%), are classified as high-income earners, earning more than ₱8 million annually. This distribution illustrates that most employees are either exempt from taxes or fall within the middle-income range, with a small portion of high-income individuals contributing significantly to the tax base. Based on the data above, approximately 9.69 million employees (41% of registered compensation earners) stand to benefit from the proposed one-month income tax holiday. These individuals fall under the middle-income groups, earning above ₱250,000 annually, and are currently subject to withholding tax on their salaries. The majority of employees — around 13.90 million (59%) — are exempt from income tax due to being Minimum Wage Earners (MWE) or having low income (i.e. ₱250,000 or less annually), meaning they would not directly benefit from the proposed tax holiday. Therefore, the tax holiday would primarily benefit those in the middle- to upper-income brackets, while offering no immediate relief to MWEs and low-income workers. Given these disparities, alternative tax reforms may be a more equitable solution. One option is raising the income tax exemption threshold, as proposed in Senator Win Gatchalian’s GINHAWA Act. The bill suggests increasing the exemption to ₱400,000, meaning income below this amount would be tax-exempt. It also proposes raising the tax-free bonus cap from ₱90,000 to ₱150,000, allowing employees to keep more of their year-end bonuses. Although raising the exemption threshold could benefit a wider group of people, it presents significant challenges to fiscal sustainability. Like the proposed one-month tax holiday, such changes must be carefully considered in light of the government’s ability to fund essential public services, social programs, and development goals. Tax relief is an important issue, but any reform must strike a balance between supporting Filipino workers and ensuring the government can maintain sufficient revenue for its operations. This involves not only introducing new tax laws or adjusting current rates (e.g., excise taxes, rate unification, price floors) but also improving collection efficiency, curbing illicit trade (such as counterfeit goods, smuggled products, and illegal mining), and ensuring proper tax compliance. Ultimately, any tax policy reform should prioritize equity, sustainability, and long-term economic stability. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Ask the Tax Whiz] What’s the impact of the income tax holiday proposal to PH economy?,https://www.rappler.com/business/ask-the-whiz-impact-income-tax-holiday-proposal-philippine-economy/,Rappler
"When Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) announced its intention to issue a blue bond, it did more than enter a rising frontier of sustainable finance. It opened a new debate: Can private capital genuinely protect the Philippine marine economy — or will “blue” merely rebrand old vulnerabilities in public infrastructure finance? This is no ordinary issue about geography. The Philippines is a nation of coasts — 36,000 kilometers of shorelines, marine biodiversity that rivals the Coral Triangle, and a population clustered along fragile waters. Yet those same waters have long been collateral damage in the country’s most expensive and politically charged public spending category: coastal development, flood control, port expansion, and wastewater systems. Through the years, billions of government funds have been allocated on these crucial concerns — billions that remain unaccounted for. Since public funding is generally used to benefit communities through health programs, environmental care, or infrastructure in high-need communities, one question naturally emerges when a private bank like BPI steps in with capital tied to oceans, wastewater, and coastal resilience: Are blue bonds a visionary tool or an admission that public funds tend to vanish before their job was done? 1. Definition creep / “blue-washing” risk Green, blue, and social bonds are all thematic bonds designed to finance projects that create a specific positive impact, but their focus areas differ. Green bonds are dedicated to environmental projects, and social bonds fund initiatives that promote social well-being. Blue bonds are a specialized category within green bonds, specifically targeting the financing of projects related to ocean and marine conservation. One of the largest risks in any green, blue, or social is the credibility of the Use-of-Proceeds and the risk of “green / blue-washing” (i.e., proceeds used for projects that claim sustainability credentials but in effect are only marginally so). For a blue bond especially, the boundaries can be fuzzy: what counts as “marine and ocean-based sustainability”? Does it include large commercial shipping that merely replaces one fuel with another? Does it include port expansion with increased traffic? Does it include coastal real-estate development labeled as “eco-tourism” but with heavy environmental impact? Without tight eligibility criteria and strong third-party verification, the risk is that the instrument becomes a mere marketing tool rather than a real effort with social impact. Given that BPI’s framework only includes Blue as one category (rather than clearly evidencing many projects ready for deployment) one must ask: will BPI refrain from issuing until there are enough pipeline projects with concrete measurable outcomes, or will market pressure push them to issue first and then find projects later? BPI says it already “has some projects that would be eligible once it have the framework,” but that still leaves the door open for opportunistic use. 2. Project risk / execution risk Marine and ocean-based projects often carry higher execution risk: permitting (coastal zoning, environmental impact assessments), community opposition, logistics (offshore installations cost more than onshore), climate risk (storms, sea-level rise, typhoons), and technology risk (marine renewables are less mature). If BPI finances these projects via the blue bond, then there is higher risk of cost overruns, delays, and non-performance which may either undermine investor confidence or lead to reputational risk for the bank. Also, if the projects generate revenue streams (fishing, tourism, port logistics) they may be subject to regulatory risk, biodiversity impact risk (if not done sensitively), or climate-shock risk, which raises questions for the bank about how it will mitigate such risk, and whether the bond documentation includes risk allocation, reserve funds, monitoring, etc. 3. Funding cost versus use-of-proceeds mismatch In BPI’s previous issuance (the SINAG bonds), the bond was a short tenor (1.5 years) and a relatively high coupon (5.85% per annum) for domestic investors. If a blue bond is issued, the maturity, coupon, currency and investor base will matter greatly. If BPI issues in peso with short maturity, then longer-lived marine projects (which might have pay-back periods of 10-20 years) risk a mismatch: short-term funding for long-term assets. That creates refinancing risk. If investors expect shorter durations, then BPI will have to roll over, potentially at higher cost. If cost of funds is too high, then the bank may either limit the types of projects financed or accept lower internal rates of return — which may challenge economic viability. 4. Accountability and reporting — not a one-off marketing exercise The value of thematic bonds lies not only in raising money but in linking capital to measurable outcomes. If BPI issues a blue bond and then fails to publish credible, audited impact reports (for instance: % of proceeds deployed, types of projects, socio-economic environmental outcomes, verification by independent third party) then the instrument risks being viewed cynically. For those interested in governance, the question they must ask is: will BPI publish disaggregated data on what portion of proceeds go to e.g., sustainable fisheries vs wastewater vs marine renewables? What are the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or jobs created in coastal communities, tons of plastics removed from Gulf of Manila, megawatts (MWs) of marine renewable energy installed? Will there be claw-back or penalty mechanisms if deliverables are not met? The Sustainable Funding Framework mentions reporting, but the devil will be in the details. 5. Potential crowding out / misallocation risk While blue bonds direct funding toward sustainability, there is a governance angle: will they inadvertently crowd out other equally needed investments (e.g., in weaker rural banking, in community credit, in infrastructure in less glamorous sectors)? Also, given the potential “buzz” around blue finance, will some sub-optimal projects be elevated simply to qualify, even though their social or ecological returns are low? In other words: the existence of a labeled bond does not automatically guarantee optimal allocation of capital — there must be a strong governance overlay. Given the Philippines’ history of large-scale infrastructure procurement concerns (which you routinely track), one must watch for transparency regarding project selection, procurement, bidding, supplier oversight, contractor performance. Otherwise, “sustainability theatre” is the risk that arises. 6. Macro / interest-rate / liquidity risk From an investor perspective, blue bonds are still niche, especially in the Philippines. If global interest rates rise, investor appetite may weaken, or yield premiums may widen. For BPI, issuing at the wrong time may mean paying a higher coupon or facing weaker investor demand. There’s also the potential of foreign-currency risk if the bond is issued offshore and repatriated back for domestic projects (unless hedged properly). These broader funding conditions may affect whether the blue bond becomes a cost-effective instrument — something BPI itself acknowledges as it watches market timing. BPI’s sustainable funding framework outlines eligible uses: 1. Waste and wastewater systems near rivers and coasts2. Marine renewable energy (offshore wind, tidal, floating solar) Crucially, traditional flood-control civil works do NOT fall under BPI’s eligibility list. That means no dredging contracts, no dikes, no embankments — the very contracts linked to some of the country’s most persistent procurement controversies. Still, the overlap is unmistakable. Where there are wastewater systems, permits follow. Where ports modernize, government concessions and the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) loom. Where coastal assets rise, local government unit (LGU) approvals and environmental compliance certificates unlock land and water. Although the bond may not touch the flood-control budgets of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), it will stand at the shoreline of government influence. And historically, that shoreline is where public funds have washed out to sea. Fairness demands this: blue bonds can do good. They can move capital faster than the bureaucracy. They can unlock long-term financing for offshore wind and modern sewage systems — both of which government has talked about for decades and still struggles to scale. They can force measurable environmental KPIs, annual reporting, and independent verification — standards government projects only dream of. They can build wastewater treatment where fecal coliform still pollutes Manila Bay. They can support ports that don’t spew untreated bilge into coastal waters. They can finally bring credible financing to fisheries certification — protecting livelihoods instead of merely announcing “livelihood projects.” If executed with rigor, blue finance can leapfrog decades of bureaucratic neglect. And the Philippines — battered by climate change, reliant on ports, dependent on coasts — desperately needs that. For every promising headline, three hard questions follow: 1. IF THE GOVERNMENT ALREADY FUNDED COASTAL PROJECTS, WHY ARE BANKS NEEDED NOW? – Was public money wasted? Delayed? Diverted? Sustainable finance markets do not typically appear in countries where fiscal delivery works flawlessly. They emerge where public capacity is strained or compromised. 2. WHO DECIDES WHICH PROJECTS QUALIFY? – BPI screens internally and hires third-party verifiers. Government does not control the selection — and that is both a blessing and a risk. 3. COULD BLUE LABELS MASK OLD NETWORKS? – The framework bars generic flood-control projects, but wastewater and port environmental upgrades still intersect with traditional contractors and local fiefdoms. Without name-by-name disclosure, even verified funds could flow adjacent to power blocs with a history of shaping coastal budgets. BPI promises: Good — but not enough. The Filipino public deserves project-level visibility, not just aggregated summaries. If taxpayers spent years funding similar priorities, citizens have the right to know where gaps appeared — and who now fills them. A bond marketing like “blue economy” cannot operate behind a blue curtain. We should welcome innovation. We should welcome private capital that aligns profit with stewardship. And we should welcome banks that finance sewage treatment and offshore wind instead of casinos and condos. But we should never welcome with blind trust projects in sectors where billions in public money dissolved without trace. If BPI’s blue bond brings rigor, transparency, and project-by-project accountability, it can become a milestone — a Philippine case study in sustainable finance that protects the sea instead of subsidizing those who polluted it. If not? It risks becoming the next sophisticated vessel through which public failure is laundered into private opportunity — a sustainability label wrapped around old inefficiencies and new invisibility. What matters most now is whether BPI’s blue bonds will purify Philippine waters — or simply learn to swim in them. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] BPI’s blue bonds: Saving our seas or rebranding an old development gap?,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-things-to-know-bank-philippine-islands-blue-bonds/,Rappler
