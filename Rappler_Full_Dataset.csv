"MANILA, Philippines — Tombstones filled the Boy Scout Circle in Quezon City on Tuesday, October 28, as several advocacy groups called for the implementation of higher excise taxes on alcohol. The tombstones, written with anti-alcohol statements, stood for the 47 Filipinos who die every day due to alcohol-related causes. Representatives from various youth and community groups, including the Sin Tax Coalition, 1Tahanan Partylist, and the Action for Economic Reforms (AER) participated in the activity. According to the 2023 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), 17,088 Filipinos died from alcohol-related causes, translating to approximately 47 deaths per day and two deaths per hour. About 2.58% of all deaths in the country are attributed to alcohol consumption, including car crashes and alcohol-related illnesses and injuries. Similarly, 9.24% or 2,668 cancer deaths in the Philippines are also linked to alcohol. These include liver cancer (1,205), as well as colon and rectal cancer (546). Based on the GBD data, alcohol-related costs — including government and private spending on healthcare and productivity losses — to the economy was at P256.2 billion in 2023. However, the government only collected P108.2 billion in excise taxes on alcohol that year. Youth leader and University of the Philippines student Gwyneth Barra believed that high consumption and easy access to alcoholic products is a social cost that often results in an inefficient distribution of goods in the market, economically referred to as market failure. The sin tax law seeks to address this market failure by making alcoholic products more expensive and less accessible, especially to the youth. “It could be said that only the poor will be affected by this, but in the long run they will also be the beneficiaries because this tax will go to the development of health programs that they could benefit from,” she said. Under Republic Act 11467 or the sin tax law, alcohol taxes should be allocated to the following: Advocates assert that raising alcohol taxes would not only curb consumption and save lives but also strengthen public health financing. A large portion of alcohol tax revenues supports PhilHealth and medical assistance programs for low-income Filipinos. They believe that as alcoholic products become less accessible, those most affected by it will benefit from expanded healthcare services. AER legislative officer Paul Roset also pointed out that the Philippines’ excise duties on alcohol remain considerably lower than others in Southeast Asia. “Our proposal is to have a 25% or P9 increase in taxes for distilled spirits or gins which the masses commonly consume. A 10% increase for fermented liquor or beers. Alcopops or flavored alcohol beverages should also be taxed as fermented liquors,” said Roset. In 2024, the revenue target for excise tax on alcoholic beverages was P117.16 billion, while the total revenue collected reached P116.12 billion, falling short of about P1.04 billion. Beginning 2025, the specific excise tax per liter of distilled spirits, wines, and fermented liquor are mandated to increase by 6% annually. The national government aims to collect P4.6 trillion in tax revenues for 2026, with P132 billion coming from excess levies on alcohol products. This is an 8% increase from its current P122-billion target for 2025. Filomeno Sta. Ana, co-founder of AER, suggests increasing sin taxes on alcohol and tobacco products to help the government address the deficit. –Arriane dela Cruz/Rappler.com Arriane dela Cruz is a Rappler intern.

"The flood control corruption scandal has gripped the entire nation — prompting a series of mass protests, calls for accountability, and collective anger among the Filipino people. It sparked an outrage like no other, and with good reason. When public officials deceive the very people they’re supposed to serve, it would really only be a matter of time before it would catch up to them. Until then, the rage persists, and will naturally become a part of the mundane. Chants and symbols from demonstrations have turned into everyday sayings and icons that have made their way into music events, art markets, and even the clothes we wear. Just look at Identity Apparel, a clothing brand whose socks and t-shirts have turned into subtle calls for action. “POV: You can’t [rally at] EDSA for fear of being deported, but you can show solidarity by making merch,” the shop’s co-founder Rahul said in a TikTok as he showed off the embroidered socks they made in relation to the flood control corruption scandals. Like many Filipinos, it’s something he and his wife have kept up with. It’s even become a running joke on social media that the Senate hearings have become more entertaining than the shows we watch on Netflix. Rahul was born and raised in the Philippines, but his parents are originally from India. He shares that he was born with an Indian passport, and was naturalized as a Filipino only when he was already in his mid-20s. This, he says, is the reason why he legally cannot join protests. “Because I was naturalized as a Filipino, I am still not considered technically fully Filipino. So there are still loopholes around it wherein they could either jail me or deport me. Obviously, if someone takes action. But you don’t want to give anyone reason to take action for that,” he said. He looked to what was perhaps the next best thing: through wearable garb. From the time the brand was established in 2017, these socks had actually marked the first time Identity Apparel ever dipped its toes into making merch with political statements. And there was no better time to do it than now. It’s done in minimalist fashion, where you can almost only see the designs in full view if you look close enough. The socks come in five different designs: “Sana All Nepo Baby,” “Not A Nepo Baby,” an anti-ghost project one inspired by Ghostbusters, a “budget-eating” crocodile, and a crocodile parading around as a flood control contractor, with a matching barong and hard hat to boot. This was supposed to be a limited drop, but to Identity Apparel’s surprise, their first batch had sold out in just a few days. Now, it’s become a fixture in their store. “Even the people that weren’t able to attend rallies, I feel like they’re finding different ways to show that they’re also angry. And I think this is one of the best ways to do it,” Rahul told Rappler. A post shared by IDENTITY Apparel Shop | Men's Socks & Underwear (@identityapparel.shop) There’s now a Buwaya Tees collection, too, donning the same designs. 5% of the sales from these shirts are donated to the families affected by the recent floods. For Identity Apparel, it’s all about doing what they can do to help within their means. A post shared by IDENTITY Apparel Shop | Men's Socks & Underwear (@identityapparel.shop) Their reason behind doing this was rather simple: so we never, ever forget. “We all forget. Tell me about the last scandal that took place. At some point, we go over this hump where everyone’s angry, everyone’s frustrated. And then afterwards, it slowly dies down. The focus shifts to something else,” Rahul said. “And so this, you could consider this as a form of reminder. That’s number one. As a form of silent protest. This way, when you’re opening your sock drawer and then you see the socks, you are reminded constantly.” – Rappler.com",True,true,"Identity Apparel wants you to never, ever forget your outrage over corruption",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/identity-apparel-socks-shirts-outrage-corruption/,Rappler
"LONDON, United Kingdom – Global investors managing over $3 trillion in assets called on governments on Monday, October 20, to stop and reverse deforestation and ecosystem degradation by 2030, in a statement signed ahead of a United Nations climate conference in Brazil next month. Around 30 institutional investors including Swiss private bank Pictet Group and Nordic investor DNB Asset Management have so far signed up to the Belém Investor Statement on Rainforests, which is open until November 1. A report last week found the world is falling far short of the goal of stopping deforestation, with losses of 8.1 million hectares (20 million acres) of forest — an area about the size of England — in 2024 alone, largely driven by agricultural expansion and forest fires. “As investors, we are increasingly concerned about the material financial risks that tropical deforestation and nature loss pose to our portfolios,” the statement said. The investors emphasized the need for policies that deliver legal, regulatory, and financial certainty to help protect the forests and safeguard economic stability, said Jan Erik Saugestad, chief executive officer at Nordic firm Storebrand Asset Management. “Deforestation undermines the natural systems that global markets rely on — from climate regulation to food and water security.” Earlier this year, the European Union delayed launching its anti-deforestation law by a year after facing opposition from industry and trade partners such as Brazil, Indonesia, and the United States, who say complying with the rules would be costly and hurt their exports to Europe. The role of climate skeptic US President Donald Trump in rolling back support for global environmental efforts was also hampering action, said Ingrid Tungen, head of deforestation-free markets at Rainforest Foundation Norway. “I think Trump has made it more difficult for investors and managers to take climate and biodiversity into account in such a volatile market,” she said. “All the investors that we are talking to think there is a huge risk for us not taking diversification and climate change into consideration in the long term, and not just for their own morals, but because that will harm the markets directly and their profits directly.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Investors managing $3 trillion in assets urge countries to stop deforestation,https://www.rappler.com/business/belem-investor-statement-rainforests-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — Cradled by rich salt beds, the province of Pangasinan took on the name “Panag-asinan” — later “Pangasinan” — to mean “the place where salt is made.” But just as its air smells like fresh bangus (milk fish), fragrant buro (fermented dish), and flavorful bagoong (salted fish sauce), Pangasinan is equally proud of the sweetness that calls out to you from the corners of the bus stops to the roadside. From Calasiao to Bayambang, and everywhere in between, come along for a quick food trip beyond Pangasinan’s salty shorelines and into the core of its sweetest desserts! Calasiao, the second-oldest town in Pangasinan, is best known for its reserves of “white gold” — the beloved Puto Calasiao. The name puto traces its roots to the Malay word puttu, which translates to “portioned” — a fitting name for these bite-sized kakanins (rice cakes). Putos are made from glutinous rice, sugar, and flavorings, often stuffed with a small amount of cheese and steamed into small and soft clouds of deliciousness. Aside from its pure white color, Puto Calasiao can also burst into a rainbow — pink (strawberry), purple (ube), yellow (mango), green (pandan), and more. You will also see puto with kutsinta (the brown ones); the only difference is that kutsinta is made with a splash of lye water, which gives it its unique, bouncy, and jelly-like texture. Who said we only grill ihaw-ihaw? When you roll glutinous rice flour, coconut, sesame seeds, and molasses into banana leaves and cook them over live charcoal until soft, smoky, and sweet, you get one of the most iconic snacks of Pangasinan: tupig. The word tupig comes from the same root as dippig in Ilocano, which means “flat.” Back then, tupig was a holiday staple, but today you’ll often spot it sizzling away as street food. What makes this kakanin fun is that it’s never the same wherever you go. Some are rougher, with chunky coconut bits, while others are so sticky that they cling to the leaf. Then there are the ones that peel off clean — soft, chewy, and just the right amount of sweet inside. In the Philippines, latik is the chameleon of kakanins (rice cakes) — every region has its own way of making it. In Bayambang and in other towns in Pangasinan, it takes the form of a kakanin cooked from glutinous rice and coconut milk. The word itself may come from the Hiligaynon term for “to turn into syrup,” a nod to its signature crown: a glossy, golden sheet of caramelized sugar on top. Unlike the light, bouncy texture of leche flan (caramel custard), latik is heavier and denser — the kind of snack that can fill you up just with a few bites. It’s best eaten warm, when the caramel is still gooey, but even after it sets and curdles on the rice, this kakanin still makes for a deliciously chewy bite. This might be the best-dressed kakanin you’ll ever meet! Pozorrubio, a first-class municipality in Pangasinan, proudly claims the country’s best patupat, even celebrating the native delicacy through a festival every year. Its neat four-sided shape explains its name, from “upat,” which means “four.” Patupat is made by slowly cooking glutinous rice in sugarcane juice until it takes on that deep brown color, and then wrapped in woven banana or coconut leaves. At first glance, it may look like just another kind of suman (sticky rice cake), but one bite will tell you it’s a delicacy all its own. While you’d want to pair the typical suman with brown sugar, patupat is sweet enough to be eaten on its own. This isn’t your usual champorado (chocolate rice porridge)! Inlubi is a black rice cake made from coconut milk, sugar, and deremen — glutinous rice grains that turn from white to black during the burning process, giving this kakanin a distinct earthy flavor. And when toasted just right, a sticky bite can also turn into a crunch. For Pangasinenses, it’s a tradition to prepare inlubi during Undas or All Saints’ Day, where it’s often placed on the household altar as a food offering for the dearly departed; less for its somber appearance and more for its sweet taste. From latik’s golden gloss to inlubi’s earthy flavor, these sweet delicacies find their way to fiesta tables, solemn traditions, and even just the simple joy of eating merienda (snack). The province may be known for its salt, but it’s also in these kakanins that you’ll taste the sweet heart of home. Each province, town, and even family has its own recipe and pagtatantsa — its own way of preparing, naming, and sharing these treats. But if there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that our kakanins are more than food. They are memory, identity, and love — all wrapped in rice, coconut, and the folds of a banana leaf. – Jaella Magno/Rappler.com Jaella Magno is a Rappler volunteer and 3rd year AB Literature major in Creative Writing student from De La Salle University.",True,true,A sweet guide to Pangasinan’s treats that are worth the journey,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/guide-pangasinan-sweet-treats/,Rappler
"The following is a press release from the Maningning Foundation. On the 25th year of the passing of trilingual poet and artist Maningning Miclat, the art foundation named in her honor presents “Alaala/Alang-alang sa Sining 2025,” a dual event that will award prizes in its biennial poetry contest and launch the deluxe edition of Mario I. Miclat’s autobiographical novel, Secrets of the Eighteen Mansions (published by Erehwon Center for the Arts) on September 29 at 4 pm at the UP Asian Center GT-Toyota Auditorium at the University of the Philippines Diliman campus, Quezon City. The book has been hailed by national artists, writers, and critics. “The fiction is Truth alive,” wrote Gémino H. Abad, National Artist for Literature, while fellow National Artist for Literature Virgilio S. Almario, said: “Mario’s memoir/novel is one of the most creative histories of the rise and fall of the Maoist movement in the Philippines. It is a bold analysis of the strength and weakness of a revolution in modern times, of the expected flexibility and significance of Marxism in our society, of the tragedy of blind submission to ideology, of the need for right education even for cadres of the revolutionary movement, and the morality of the revolution.” Marjorie A. Evasco, poet and literature professor emeritus, said: “Mario’s novel seeks to open for its readers the China of Filipinos who were inside the so-called ‘bamboo curtain’ before, during, and after the Marcos dictatorship. Rich in evocative detail and animated by characters sharp in their ironic sense of the unrepeatable in human experience, the novel lays bare the secrets and moves us into new knowledge of a world made larger and deeper in its complexities.” Novelist Ninotchka Rosca wrote: “Mario’s book has been difficult to get into; probably because it is a familiar experience — that of trying to reconcile the dissonance between revolutionary values and revolutionary practice. The book is so filled with sadness.” Meanwhile, another novelist, Charlson Ong said: “Secret lives. Secret loves. Secret wars. The 18 mansions betray secrets that are as cruel as the fate of nations, as enduring as a people’s spirit, as fragile as the human heart. This too is our History, our Exile.” The program will feature a prayer by Robert Reyes, remarks by Asian Center dean Noel Moratilla, introduction on the author and the book by the former dean Joefe Santarita, and special numbers by Calle Manu, Aba Dalena, and Banaue Miclat. The finalists for the Filipino poetry category are: Andro Blancada, Ronel Osias, and Tresia S. Traqueña. There are four finalists for the English poetry category: Graciela Acedera, Vince Raphael V.

"MANILA, Philippines – In a population of 116.6 million, only 28% of Filipinos hold a life insurance policy in 2025. The industry penetration remains stuck at 1.7% of GDP, one of the lowest among the countries in Southeast Asia, according to data from analytics firm Inquiro. The newly released PURPLE Report, commissioned by EastWest Ageas Insurance, also showed that the average Filipino has only set aside P50,000 for emergencies, which is barely enough to cover a routine medical procedure, let alone a major illness like ischemic heart disease — the country’s top cause of death — where treatment can cost P690,000. This readiness gap is not just financial. It is structural, cultural, and educational. It is also deeply personal. New analytics from Inquiro’s MarketScan dataset reveal that while the digital shift toward insurance is real, it remains uneven across the country. Among the 5.2 million Filipinos tracked for app-based insurance activity, adults aged 29-37 and middle-aged adults aged 38-51 emerge as the most frequent users. During the annual December surge, when many conduct financial checkups and sign up for new policies, middle-aged adults alone make up 36% of all high-frequency users. Urban areas continue to dominate adoption, with the National Capital Region (NCR), Cebu, Baguio/Benguet, and Davao City showing the strongest digital footprint. Meanwhile, several municipalities, particularly in remote parts of Mindanao and Tawi-Tawi, recorded zero insurance app usage as of May 2025. The numbers paint a clear picture: interest is rising, but the gaps are stark. While the figures can be discouraging, Sjoerd Smeets, president and CEO of EastWest Ageas Insurance, thinks it can also be seen as an opportunity. “The Philippine market has tremendous potential,” he told Rappler. “It’s young, digitally connected, and increasingly aware of the importance of financial security.” Smeets cited the top three challenges facing the Philippine insurance market: 1. The protection gap and affordability Many Filipinos underestimate the financial impact of illness or accidents, and products often feel out of reach. But several insurers now offer a wide portfolio, such as the P22-per-day entry-level term plans of EastWest Ageas for comprehensive critical illness and investment-linked solutions. 2. Low financial literacy Insurance documents can feel intimidating. So insurers need to respond to this challenge by offering plain-language materials, advice-led sales, and highly accessible educational campaigns on social media. 3. Digital trust and service speed Customers expect seamless, secure experiences. To meet this, insurers can offer self-service options, and even use generative AI to help advisors explain complex products and underwriting questions instantly and clearly. Smeets believes insurers must simplify, educate, and localize, while policymakers should enable digital onboarding and inclusion. “Insurance isn’t just for the wealthy,” he stressed. “It’s for anyone who loves someone and wants to protect them.” According to Smeets, the PURPLE Report’s findings are sobering. Inflation and unstable incomes further widen the readiness gap, especially among those aged 22 to 39. Yet even amid these challenges, resilience persists, with many Filipinos relying on family support and personal resourcefulness to get by. Smeets believes this is precisely why insurance must evolve and be communicated in a more human, relatable way. He also shares a simple lesson from his childhood: saving begins with discipline, not income. For young Filipinos, he recommends starting with an emergency fund and then securing essential layers of protection, beginning with health coverage, followed by accident insurance and income protection for breadwinners. As income increases, these foundations can grow into long-term savings and legacy planning. “Insurance isn’t about fear,” Smeets said. “It’s about care — caring for yourself and the people who matter most.” “Every Filipino deserves security,” he added. For millions of uninsured Filipinos balancing aspirations with daily responsibilities, he hopes that readiness to any life circumstances becomes not a privilege, but a possibility. – Rappler.com",True,true,"The P50,000 problem: Why most Filipinos remain uninsured",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/why-most-filipinos-remain-uninsured/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine economy grew just 4% in the third quarter of 2025 as the flood control scandal dampened investor and consumer confidence, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Friday, November 7. The latest gross domestic product (GDP) print is slower than the second quarter’s 5.5% growth rate, and places the country’s average economic growth for the year so far at just 5%. The Marcos administration aims to grow the economy by 5.5% to 6.5% in 2025. The GDP print is also much lower than analysts’ expectations of around 5.3%. It marks the Philippine economy’s slowest growth since the contraction in the first quarter of 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government infrastructure spending plunged to a 14-year low of -26.2% growth amid stricter validation measures for the Department of Public Works and Highways’ projects, as well as delayed billings and disbursements for government works. These measures were implemented in light of the government’s ongoing probe into anomalous flood control projects. Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan also noted that the flood control scandal affected consumer confidence, as households postponed their purchases of durable goods. Household spending grew by just 0.5% in the third quarter. On the production side, all three major industries posted growth in the third quarter. The agriculture sector (2.8% growth) rebounded from last year’s contraction (-2.7%), but growth in industry (0.7%) and services (5.5%) slowed from the same quarter in 2024. Balisacan admitted that to meet the government’s target growth range, the economy will have to grow by around 6.8% in the fourth quarter. “Given the shocks that are happening at the moment and are expected to linger in the remaining weeks and before the year ends, that’s quite challenging,” he said. Balisacan noted that the last time public construction spending contracted by over 20% was in 2011 amid the late former president Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III’s crackdown on corruption. Because of the loss of consumer and investor confidence, Balisacan vowed to implement “strategic interventions” to bolster trust and accelerate economic growth. These include fast-tracking social protection for vulnerable Filipinos and pursuing long-term governance reforms such as proposed amendments to the bank secrecy law. He also hopes that the government can begin disbursing funds for projects that are not tainted with corruption. “Those projects that were intended for 2025 that were already completed and are not involved with any of those red flags, they should be paid so that the resources, the funds will recirculate in the economy and create other opportunities, more opportunities,” he said. The country’s chief economist also noted that the government is underspending in key priority areas despite an increase in funding for infrastructure over the years. “The productive capacity that we had wanted to happen was muted by all this corruption because the investment in infrastructure that we are trying to ramp up is supposed to enhance the capacity of the economy to produce more, to employ more, to generate higher quality jobs,” Balisacan explained. Balisacan underscored the importance of not just merely increasing infrastructure spending, but improving the quality of spending as well. This means ensuring that public funds are spent on high-quality projects that will boost economic growth, even if it means working with a smaller budget. “So what I think lagged behind and we should have worked on harder are the governance and institutional mechanisms that would allow us to accommodate such kind of spending. And this is…I think an important lesson — that we did not focus much on equally important areas of good economic management, and it is the ecosystem that would allow us to ensure that there is consistency between policy design and implementation and outcomes,” he said. – Rappler.com",True,true,Corruption woes drag Philippines’ economic growth to 4-year low in Q3 2025,https://www.rappler.com/business/gross-domestic-product-philippines-q3-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Inflation remained unchanged in October 2025 at 1.7% amid a slower uptick in food prices, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Wednesday, November 5. The latest figure also places the average inflation rate for 2025 at 1.7%, still below the government’s target range of 2% to 4%. According to National Statistician Dennis Mapa, inflation in food prices slowed to just 0.3% in October compared to 0.8% in September. This means food prices still increased but at a slower pace. Inflation of meat prices, particularly pork, began to slow at 9.8%, while vegetable inflation decreased to 16.6% from 19.4% in September. However, fish prices continued to climb, recording an inflation print of 11.7% from 10.9% the month before. Rice prices also continued to deflate (-17%) amid the ongoing rice import ban and increased local palay production. (READ: Gov’t to extend rice import ban until end of 2025) “So, ‘yung production natin mataas. Of course, ‘yung prices in the world market ay bumababa na rin. So, that actually affected in a good manner ‘yung ating presyo ng bigas dahil continuously bumaba na siya,” Mapa said. (So our [palay] production was high. Of course, prices in the world market are also going down. So that actually affected the local price of rice in a good way since it’s continuously going down.) Slower food inflation, however, was offset by a surge in the inflation of power rates. Mapa noted that electricity inflation nearly quadrupled to 4.1% from just 1.2% in September. This was most felt in Metro Manila, as electricity inflation surged to 16% from 10.6%. The capital region’s inflation print climbed to 2.9% in October from 2.7%. The Manila Electric Company earlier announced a rate hike of P0.2331 per kilowatt-hour in October’s billing as generation charges increased due to the depreciation of the Philippine peso. The peso dropped to a record low of P59.13 against the US dollar in late October. Meanwhile, inflation in regions outside Metro Manila continued to slow to 1.3% in October amid easing food inflation. Central Visayas recorded the fastest inflation rate at 2.6%, while the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao continued to log deflation at -1.3%. Negative inflation or deflation means prices of goods and services have dropped. Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said the country’s latest inflation print reflects the government’s measures to manage food supply and protect consumers from price volatility. “The steady headline inflation rate shows that our coordinated interventions are helping to maintain adequate supplies and keeping essential goods affordable. We remain vigilant in managing risks from weather disturbances, global market volatility, and other domestic factors that may affect prices in the coming months,” he wrote in a statement. DEPDev added that the Marcos administration is pursuing long-term reforms to enhance productivity and economic resilience through investments in agriculture, energy, and logistics. Balisacan described these as essential to protecting Filipinos’ purchasing power, which he hopes will translate into the creation of better jobs and sustained economic growth. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) also said that it expects inflation to remain generally benign. However, the monetary authority noted that its outlook for domestic economic growth is weaker amid tepid business confidence due to the flood control corruption scandal. “Indications of slowing demand also reflect lingering uncertainty from the external environment,” the BSP said.

"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Energy (DOE) is imposing P24 billion in penalties on Solar Philippines Power Project Holdings Incorporated, a renewable energy firm founded by Batangas 1st District Representative Leandro Leviste, for failure to meet commitments. The penalties, which include forfeited performance bonds, administrative obligations, and estimated project costs embedded in the contracts, are being pursued by the DOE following the termination of service contracts across the renewable energy sector, according to Energy Secretary Sharon Garin. The action forms part of a broader enforcement campaign that seeks to clear stalled developments from the DOE’s energy pipeline. According to reports, the DOE is relinquishing 163 renewable energy service contracts issued from 2024 to 2025 with a total capacity of 17,900 megawatts. Solar Philippines accounted for 11,427 megawatts, or nearly two-thirds of the withdrawn capacity. Most of the canceled projects were large-scale solar developments in Luzon awarded under the government’s Green Energy Auction program. Garin said the department had issued show-cause orders to Solar Philippines and its affiliates, but that key deficiencies remained unresolved. In several cases, she said, developers failed to submit required progress reports or demonstrate sustained construction activity, triggering mandatory cancellations under the terms of the contracts. Some of the affected projects carried final completion deadlines of December 25, 2025. The cancellations underscore a central challenge in the Philippines’ transition to renewable energy: converting awarded capacity into power that actually reaches the grid. Government energy planning assumes that contracted projects will be delivered on schedule, shaping transmission investments and power-supply forecasts years in advance. When large projects stall, utilities often rely more heavily on costlier sources of electricity to meet demand, contributing to higher power prices and tighter reserve margins. Energy officials said the enforcement effort was intended to remove what they described as “zombie” projects — developments that hold land, permits and grid access but show little prospect of completion — and to reallocate scarce sites to investors with the technical and financial capacity to build. The Philippines faces a projected shortfall of 17 to 18 gigawatts under its renewable energy auction commitments, according to government data, heightening pressure to ensure that approved projects move quickly from planning to construction. When asked about the shortfall, Garin said they are already planning “more green energy auctions” in 2026. The Philippines targets to increase renewable energy’s share in the power mix to 35% by 2030. The DOE is now considering whether the revoked project areas should be placed under an open and competitive selection process, allowing new bidders to take over dormant developments. Garin said the policy overhaul underway was aimed at tightening screening rules so that long-term contracts go only to developers capable of execution. The crackdown, she added, was not intended to deter investment in renewable energy, but to restore confidence that government approvals would translate into electricity delivered to consumers. “Land and grid access are limited,” she said. “Our responsibility is to make sure these resources produce power, not just plans.” The Ombudsman is investigating Leviste for supposedly “selling” his solar business’ franchise to tycoon Manny V. Pangilinan, an allegation that Meralco PowerGen Corporation has since denied. Solar Philippines promotes itself as “the largest solar company in Southeast Asia with over 300MW of generating capacity and 10,000 hectares of land area conducive for solar farms.” Its portfolio on its website boasts of over 10,000 hectares of land to be developed in solar energy zones in Batangas, Nueva Ecija, and Tarlac. – Rappler.com",True,true,Leviste’s solar firm fined P24 billion over stalled contracts,https://www.rappler.com/business/leandro-leviste-solar-firm-fined/,Rappler
"Finance Secretary Frederick Go and newly appointed Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Commissioner Charlito Martin Mendoza have jointly announced that the tax agency was freezing all field audits and halting the issuance of every Letter of Authority (LOA) and Mission Order (MO) throughout the country. For decades, LOAs have been the most feared instruments in Philippine tax administration — capable of interrupting business operations, delaying investments, and dragging even compliant taxpayers into months of costly negotiations. To suspend them entirely was a sign that something deep inside the institution had broken. The government, through the Finance department under Go explained that taxpayers had raised concerns about LOAs which could no longer be dismissed. Go says the nation’s tax base — millions of workers, entrepreneurs, and corporations — deserved honest, predictable, and professional audits. Those qualities, he implied, had not always been present. Mendoza then formalized the freeze, directing all regional, district, and special audit units to stop issuing LOAs, except in the narrow cases allowed by law. A technical working group would begin reengineering the audit process from the ground up. Mendoza told the Senate blue ribbon committee that , moving forward, every single LOA will require the commissioner’s personal approval. Under the current system, LOAs were issued freely at the regional level, with virtually no central oversight. Regional directors exercised “absolute authority,” Mendoza said, and the documents never reached the commissioner’s desk. That decentralization, in practice, had created thousands of opportunities for manipulation. Mendoza now plans to restrict the number of LOAs a taxpayer can receive and to embed these controls inside an integrated digital system — an attempt to use technology as a buffer between enforcement and abuse. The need for such reforms became clear when Senators JV Ejercito and Erwin Tulfo revealed that revenue officers were allegedly siphoning off as much as 70%of LOA collections. (READ: Erwin Tulfo seeks Senate probe into alleged BIR extortion scheme) On paper, the BIR projected six to eight billion pesos annually from LOA-driven assessments. In reality, only two to three billion pesos reached the Treasury. The balance, lawmakers alleged, vanished into kickbacks. These were not isolated complaints. Ejercito disclosed that even European and American ambassadors had been reporting LOA-related harassment, suggesting that the LOA system had metastasized into a national reputational risk. Former BIR Commissioner Kim Henares took a contrasting position, reminding lawmakers that LOAs — when used properly — are essential tools for tax enforcement. She pointed to an internal study showing that the Philippines loses roughly ₱1 trillion in uncollected taxes each year due to evasion, under declaration, and non-filing. Without LOAs, she argued, the BIR’s ability to pursue these gaps would be severely constrained. But she also conceded that during her tenure, she imposed strict oversight on LOA issuance, limiting them as part of her audit plan. Her point was nuanced: LOAs are indispensable in theory, but in practice require tight guardrails that the institution later abandoned. The tension between these two views captures the core of the crisis. LOAs are indeed necessary for tax enforcement — but only in a tax system designed to minimize discretion. In the Philippines, LOAs became the gateway to subjective audits that hinge on disputing expenses, questioning accounting treatments, and interpreting cost structures. This structural flaw explains why LOAs became both indispensable and corruptible at the same time. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) has repeatedly documented what this looks like in the real world in complaints filed against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR). In Puregold Price Club, Inc. v. CIR (CTA EB No. 1653), the BIR issued a substantial assessment based on alleged discrepancies in cost of sales, supplier rebates, and inventory variances. The CTA later voided large portions of the assessment, ruling that they were speculative and unsupported by competent evidence. The story repeated itself in Rustan Supercenters, Inc. v. CIR (CTA Case No. 8868), where the BIR disallowed expenses tied to spoilage, promotional discounts, and merchandising operations. Again, the CTA invalidated the bulk of the assessment because the BIR relied on flawed worksheets rather than substantiated documentation. These cases demonstrate the real problem: the issue is not the LOA itself — it is the architecture of net-income taxation system, which requires BIR examiners to scrutinize and dispute expense categories that are inherently subjective. A system that compels revenue officers to interpret depreciation, challenge inventory losses, or second-guess supplier rebates will always be vulnerable to abuse. Even if Mendoza approves every LOA personally, the audit process that follows remains grounded in interpretation, not objectivity. The answer is that these reforms will help, but they cannot cure the structural defect. Centralizing LOA approval may reduce the number of frivolous or predatory audits. A digital system may create a digital trail that deters some forms of misconduct. Limiting the frequency with which a taxpayer can be audited may provide relief for businesses previously hounded by multiple, overlapping LOAs. These are meaningful improvements — but they are improvements applied to a system whose core design invites abusive interpretation. The real issue is not how many LOAs are issued or who signs them. It is what the LOA allows examiners to do once they have it. The only sustainable way to break the LOA corruption cycle is to eliminate the gray zones that LOAs exploit. And that requires moving away from a net income taxation regime where tax liability depends on the BIR’s interpretation of expenses. Vantage Point sees a need for the Philippines to revisit gross income-based taxation, where audits focus on gross receipts — objective, measurable, digitizable — and no longer hinge on questioning spoilage rates, depreciation schedules, supplier rebates, or promotional discounts. In other emerging economies, including India, Mexico, and Indonesia, simplified gross-based or presumptive taxation vastly reduced audit disputes, increased voluntary compliance, and strengthened taxpayer confidence. Businesses paid predictable taxes instead of being forced to navigate negotiations. Governments collected more revenue with fewer confrontations. Oversight became easier because discretion shrank. Here, I believe that the same transformation is possible. The government now possesses the big data infrastructure necessary to compute industry-specific gross-income tax rates with accuracy. Artificial intelligence can refine these models annually, ensuring fairness even in industries with volatile margins. Gross receipts can be verified across digital payment channels, bank reports, and third-party data sources, removing much of the subjective interaction between examiners and taxpayers. This is why the suspension of LOAs — dramatic as it may be — should be seen not as the solution, but as the opening act of a deeper reform. The BIR does not simply need fewer LOAs or more oversight. It needs a tax system that does not oblige examiners and taxpayers into interpretive battles. It needs a structure that reduces human discretion and relies instead on transparent, objective metrics. Requiring the Commissioner’s approval may slow the abuse. Limiting the number of LOAs may protect some taxpayers. A digital system may bring order to a chaotic process. But none of these measures changes the fundamental truth that net-income taxation is a model built for negotiation, and negotiation is the soil in which corruption thrives. Gross-income taxation is not just a superior alternative — it is now the only credible antidote. And in an era where 70% of LOA collections reportedly vanish before reaching the Treasury, anything less than structural change risks repeating the failures that brought the system to the brink. The Philippines must decide whether to keep repairing a broken machine or replace it with one built for transparency. The answer, I believe, is increasingly clear. – Rappler.com Click here for more Vantage Point articles.",True,true,"[Vantage Point] After BIR freezes LOAs, should PH revisit gross-income taxation?",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-bir-freeze-letters-of-authority-philippines-revisit-gross-income-taxation/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Acquisition by another tycoon. That’s the response of the troubled PrimeWater to mounting grievances by its millions of consumers who now call the Villar-led company “crime water.” The Villar group confirmed on Tuesday, December 16, that 100% of PrimeWater had been acquired by Crystal Bridges Holding Corporation, the investment firm of Puregold tycoon Lucio Co. Crystal Bridges is owned by Co’s children, with Puregold heir Vincent Co as chairman and president, according to the company’s 2025 general information sheet. “Crystal Bridges Holding Corporation of the Lucio Co Group has entered into definitive agreements for the acquisition of 100% of PrimeWater Infrastructure Corp,” the Villar group said in a statement Tuesday. Crystal Bridges will take over in the middle of multiple investigations and local governments wanting to preterminate all over the country. On the ground in Bacolod City, consumers are frustrated by the sale. “Now that PrimeWater is in hot water, it is simply being sold to another private entity. Is this the solution? Where is the accountability? Will PrimeWater be allowed to walk away without consequences? Is this yet another attempt to fool the Bacolodnons?” the Bacolod City Water District Employees Union said in a statement. Bacolod City just averted a major water crisis this weekend. PrimeWater had not paid three months of outstanding bills to its water supplier, and the subcontractor had threatened to cut the water line. Emergency negotiations ended in a clutch commitment by PrimeWater to pay on Saturday, December 13, or a day after the deadline. PrimeWater not paying its subcontractors is not an isolated incident as Rappler had reported on another contractor involved in at least two water districts. Senator Raffy Tulfo, chair of the Senate public works committee investigating PrimeWater’s failure of obligations in at least half of its nearly 80 joint venture agreements, had also cited another case of an unpaid contractor. In Himamaylan, Negros Occidental, the local council wants full transparency of what the Co group’s acquisition will entail. Vice Mayor Justin Dominic Gatuslao told Rappler over a phone call on Wednesday, December 17, that the local government was not informed beforehand, and that “it turns out even the members of the board of the water district were not aware of the transaction.” Gatuslao said the next move of the council will be to ask the water district for the strategy with the Co group. “What are our non-negotiables and what is it that we want to push considering that we want to take this as a new opportunity, a fresh start so that we can finally take off from a solid foundation?” said Gatuslao, who described the Villar group operation as “definitely a failure.” In San Fernando, Pampanga, Mayor Vilma Caluag told Rappler over a phone call Tuesday evening that they are not keen on giving PrimeWater a second chance even with different management. The mayor appealed to the new owners, “Palayain na nila kami, pakawalan na nila kami, nagmakakaawa ako sa kanila para naman mabawasan naman ang challenges namin sa siyudad ng San Fernando.” (Free us, let us go, I’m begging them, so we could ease the challenges we face here in the city of San Fernando.) Caluag unilaterally suspended PrimeWater’s business permit in her city, which is now being pitched as a blueprint for other localities that want out of the 25-year deal. The water district, which is under the Local Water Utilities Administration, had also preterminated the contract, according to Caluag. But PrimeWater’s technique has always been to take to court whoever attempts to break free, and “most of the time,” they win, said Tulfo during a Senate hearing. Caluag said PrimeWater had been allowed three catch-up plans in San Fernando, but services did not improve. Since doing a full offensive on PrimeWater, Caluag said the constituents have experienced some relief in water services. “Ayaw na naming magkasuhan, wala naman kaming ibubuga kapag kasuhan na. Sana palayain na lang nila kami, makapag-move on na kami, at makapagtrabaho na kami nang maayos.” (We don’t want a legal battle anymore, we don’t stand a chance. So, I hope they let us go so we can move on, and we can get to work.) In metropolitan La Union, the water district is still locked in a legal battle over pretermination. The Water for the People Network La Union said the sale was just a “pure business transaction” that “did not answer fundamental questions” about the joint venture. “Hindi dapat payagan na makalusot lang ang mga Villar sa kanilang perwisyo sa mamamayan. Dapat pagbayarin sila ng danyos sa mga konsyumer na pinagkaitan nila ng maayos na serbisyo sa tubig,” the group said in a statement sent to Rappler on Wednesday. (We should not allow the Villars to get away with the damage they have caused the community. They should be made to pay damages to consumers they deprived of good water service.) Hospitality business owners in surf town San Juan, La Union, who have been impacted by the water disruptions, said that while the sale “may invite reassessment… the sale of PrimeWater does not extinguish existing service obligations.” “Consumers must not be made to shoulder the cost of PrimeWater’s operational and management failures,” said Monalisa Luebben-Binlot, president of the San Juan Resort Restaurant and Hotel Association. Prior to the acquisition, PrimeWater was wholly owned by Prime Asset Ventures of Manuel Paolo Villar, the son of former senator Manny Villar, and brother of senators Mark Villar and Camille Villar. It was during the time of Mark Villar as secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways under the Duterte administration when PrimeWater rapidly grew, increasing its joint venture agreements by five-fold. From 15 JVAs by the end of 2015, they now have 77 JVAs nationwide. Half have been wanting to forfeit PrimeWater’s performance bond, according to Rappler’s analysis of audit reports, and half have been wanting to preterminate the contracts, according to Tulfo’s survey of its partner water districts. Kabataan Representative Renee Co told Rappler in an earlier interview that PrimeWater under Villar should be criminally investigated “for estafa, syndicated estafa, and graft, if officials are involved.” “The government should freeze assets and require performance bonds to make sure contractors, water districts, and consumers get paid and protected,” said Co. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Lucio Co group buys troubled PrimeWater, consumers still aggrieved",https://www.rappler.com/business/lucio-vincent-co-buy-primewater/,Rappler
"On November 21 of this year, Nigeria’s narcotics agency detained an all-Filipino crew after seizing 20 kilos of high-grade cocaine hidden aboard a Panama-registered vessel from Brazil — now under joint scrutiny by United States and British counter-narcotics units patrolling strategic Atlantic and Gulf shipping lanes. The episode underscores a hard geopolitical reality: as maritime routes increasingly double as battlegrounds for great-power influence, law enforcement, and intelligence collection, Filipino seafarers are being pulled into the slipstream of high-stakes security operations — while Manila still lacks a coherent maritime, diplomatic, and intelligence strategy to shield its own workers from the fallout. Even before the Nigeria incident happened, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) on November 12 had already issued Advisory No. 34, framing the document as a protective measure — an institutional shield for the country’s globally deployed seafarers. It presented the document as another loud gesture of solidarity with Filipino seafarers. But the deeper one reads into the memo, the more it reveals a government in full regulatory retreat, ignoring international obligations, undermining global labor standards, and leaving manning and shipping companies to absorb liabilities that properly belong to the State. At its core, the advisory exposes a dangerous truth: the Philippines is abandoning its legal responsibilities just as the world is ramping up maritime enforcement, digital forensics, and cross-border criminal crackdowns. And the cost of this abdication will not be paid by politicians. It will be paid by Filipino seafarers and by the maritime industry that keeps a trillion-peso lifeline flowing into the Philippine economy. The advisory itself acknowledges that Filipino crew members have been deported and arrested in US ports for alleged possession of child-sexual-exploitation material (CSEM) — a crime so severe that any responsible government would launch an immediate inquiry. Yet DMW Advisory No. 34 orders no investigation. It demands no evidence. It seeks no coordination with US Homeland Security, INTERPOL, or even the Philippine Department of Justice. Instead, it instructs manning agencies and foreign shipowners to provide free legal assistance, handle all port-related issues, and report compliance within 30 days — as though the government’s duty under international law can simply be outsourced to private companies that have no jurisdiction in foreign courts. To anyone familiar with the International Labor Organization (ILO), this is an astonishing departure from established global norms. Under the ILO Maritime Labor Convention (MLC), the primary responsibility for the fair treatment of seafarers lies with governments, not private employers. It is the home country’s obligation to secure legal representation, liaise with the detaining State, verify forensic evidence, and protect its nationals from discriminatory or unjust treatment. The MLC’s entire framework is built on the principle that seafarers operate in high-risk, transnational environments and that the State — neither the shipowner nor the manning agency — must serve as the legal, diplomatic, and institutional anchor when its citizens are detained abroad. DMW Advisory No. 34 turns that principle on its head. Rather than fulfilling its ILO mandate, the Philippine government steps aside and compels private actors to perform duties only a sovereign State can legally carry out. The result is a regulatory void: foreign authorities conduct investigations, the Philippine government declares victimhood without evidence, and manning companies are left to navigate criminal proceedings they cannot influence and diplomatic processes they cannot initiate. The ILO envisions state accountability; Memo 34 normalizes state abandonment. The dangers of this approach are already visible. Just days ago, Nigeria’s National Drug Law Enforcement Agency arrested an all-Filipino crew aboard a Panama-registered vessel after uncovering 20 kilograms of high-purity cocaine buried beneath its cargo. Nigeria immediately launched a coordinated, forensic-grade investigation with US and British anti-drug units, tracing trafficking routes across Brazil, Colombia, and West Africa. NDLEA intercepts cocaine shipment from Brazil, detains ship, 20 Filipino crew members. Nigeria is not, and will never be your foothold, Marwa warns drug cartels pic.twitter.com/RetLwLyVWM This is the new enforcement environment: faster, sharper, data-rich, and deeply interconnected. Yet Manila’s response to the Lagos arrests was silence. No consular team was dispatched. No forensic request was filed. No diplomatic intervention was attempted. The Philippine government appeared almost paralyzed — as if the world is acting at a pace and level of sophistication it is unwilling or unable to match. What makes this inertia even more troubling is that the DMW has not merely failed to enforce global standards. The Department has historically mistreated the very industry it now expects to shoulder its burdens. The maritime sector has long endured punitive, arbitrary, and politically motivated regulatory behavior. A major Philippine manning company saw its operations crippled for nearly a year after the government suspended its accreditation over a labor incident that had already been resolved in a European court. Despite clear documentation, the DMW refused to lift the suspension until political pressure eased. Ships were forced to replace Filipino crew with non-Filipino nationals at significant cost. The agency suffered reputational damage that still lingers in international markets. In another instance, thousands of seafarers were stranded when the Philippine government imposed an abrupt deployment freeze, citing “worker protection,” even though no worker had been harmed and the freeze had no basis in any ILO-compliant investigative process. Foreign shipowners absorbed millions in losses as vessels were delayed, rerouted, or compelled to hire emergency replacement crews from other labor-supplying countries. The Philippines — despite being the world’s largest source of maritime labor — treated shipowners as expendable and manning agencies as scapegoats, as though global fleet operators have infinite patience for regulatory chaos. These patterns of behavior erode trust, and trust is the only currency that matters in the maritime world. Shipowners deploy Filipino crew because they trust the workforce, but they also need to trust the Philippine government. They need to know that when a crime is alleged, the government will follow the ILO’s due-process framework — not lash out at employers or retreat into political narratives. They need to know that when foreign authorities act, the Philippines will engage with equal seriousness. They need to know that when allegations are true, the government will confront the problem — not pretend it does not exist. Instead, the DMW has nurtured a culture of denial and deflection. Industry insiders reveal that even before Memo 34 was finalized, DMW officials were already advising seafarers to “check” or “clean” their devices before entering US ports. This advice is catastrophic in its implications. It suggests avoidance rather than compliance, concealment rather than behavioral correction. It trivializes forensic evidence, undermines international cooperation, and sends a signal to the global maritime community that the Philippines views digital-crime enforcement not as a rule-of-law issue, but as a public-relations problem. It is a morally bankrupt posture — one that ignores the reality that CSEM crimes involve real children. The victims are real and the harm is verifiable. The contrast with the ILO could not be starker. Where the MLC requires governments to verify evidence, the DMW assumes discrimination. Where the ILO demands state involvement, Memo 34 demands private sector sacrifice. Where the ILO sees shipowners as partners, the DMW treats them as disposable. Where the MLC envisions transparency, Manila substitutes political theater. The maritime world is changing. Enforcement regimes are tightening. Digital forensics is becoming more precise. Transnational criminal networks are being dismantled through coordinated intelligence efforts. In this environment, the Philippines cannot afford a weak, passive, denial-driven maritime governance model. The country’s role as the world’s premier provider of seafarers is not guaranteed. It is earned — and it can be lost. Memo 34 is a warning that the Philippines is drifting into irrelevance and vulnerability. It signals a government unwilling to engage with global realities and unprepared to meet its ILO obligations. If Manila continues down this path, foreign shipowners will eventually look elsewhere for talent—not out of bias, but out of necessity. And when that happens, no memo, no speech, and no political slogan will save a maritime legacy that took generations to build. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] DMW Advisory No. 34: How PH gov’t mishandles the maritime sector,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-dmw-advisory-34-seafarer-protection-failure/,Rappler
"Almost all of what is currently known about the first circumnavigation of the world, one of mankind’s greatest achievements, is from the writings of Antonio Pigafetta, a Venetian born explorer who served as an assistant and scribe to the Magellan-led expedition. Of 240 men on five galleons who left Spain in 1519, only 18 (7.5%, or roughly one in 13) returned in 1522, on a single ship, and Pigafetta was one of them. Pigafetta himself survived the carnage in Mactan, witnessed the battle that led to Magellan’s death, writing about it in a journal (which itself has not survived). Upon arrival back in Spain and Italy, he was called to the royal courts several times to report on the achievements, and he eventually wrote it up for publication, between 1522 to 1525. There are four extant manuscripts of the Pigafetta work — one in Italian, and three in French, and they were prepared for three different patrons. The Italian manuscript is in the Bibliotheca Ambrosiana in Milan, is described as “workmanlike rather than elegant, written on paper by a neat humanistic hand, unilluminated, and illustrated by 23 map-sketches.” It is the only remaining representative of textual translation deriving from Pigafetta’s original draft. Two of the French manuscripts are in the Bibliotheque National de Paris, and the third, and most complete, of the French manuscripts, is the Nancy-Libri-Philipps-Beinecke-Yale Codex, which translator-editor R.A. Skelton describes as “certainly the most magnificent of the four in respect to of its writing, its illumination, and its maps.” “Precise date of the writing of the French manuscripts cannot be ascertained, except for the fact that they were executed within in few years of Pigafetta’s original draft. Collation of the French text suggests that each of the three derives from a common source: a lost French text translated from the Italian, with some editorial manipulation,” Skelton says. This Ilonggo notes piece is based on a very lucky, inexpensive find at a second hand bookstore in the UK, in June of 2023. This is Skelton’s translation (dated 1969, re-published 1975 by the Folio Society) of Pigafetta’s Magellan’s Voyage – A Narrative Account of the First Navigation. The translation is based on the French manuscript in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library of Yale University. Scanning through it, I was struck by a list of familiar words, on pages 97 to 99. On page 97, titled “The island named Zzubu” (Cebu) Pigafetta lists, “Some words of the aforesaid heathen peoples.” Some 150 words with a few short phrases are listed; well over a third of those words are generally familiar and easily understood by Ilonggos and other Visayans of today, whether in verbal, or written formats. Many words, with minor spelling variations, are virtually identical to what we use today in our Kinaray-a, Hiligaynon and/or Cebuano languages. In a later part of the book, Pigafetta also lists a few hundred words spoken in the Moluccas, and many are similar to the ones Ilonggos use today. It is worth keeping in mind that what appears in this edition has been through several iterations through the past 450 years. Pronunciation and spelling, even alphabet letters have evolved through the centuries. Since Pigafetta may not have been able to read script, this is probably transliterated as the way these words were spoken, in the written language of the time, using their selling and phonetic conventions. There are also no diacritical marks so we cannot assume that the pronunciation is the same, and accents and vowel emphasis may also have changed through the centuries. Pigafetta wrote originally in Italian, then his journals were translated into French, and then the version of his works held by Yale university were translated into English by Skelton. Some letters may not have been introduced in the early 16th century; there are generally no “u”, “y”,” k”, “w”, “h”, etc. Judging from current usage, it may also appear that Pigafetta may have mixed up some of the words. A list of those words which are still familiar to me — whether in Karay-a, Hiligaynon, or Cebuano — are listed verbatim from the text of Magellan’s Voyage. Since Pigafetta spent relatively more time in present day Cebu, most of the vocabulary below would have been from that place. My notes are in the parentheses following each word. Pigafetta’s work is important not only as a source of information about the voyage; it is an early Western description of the people and languages of what is now known as the Philippines (and other lands visited by the expedition). Skelton notes, in his introduction, that Pigafetta “brought to his task of recording a capacity for keen observation, sympathetic interpretation, and expressive communication of experience which enabled him to produce one of the most remarkable documents in the history of geographical and ethnological discovery.” Among many other things, Pigafetta describes the natives, their attire, rituals and ceremonies, the blood compact, domesticated animals, use of gold, boats, beverages, armor and weaponry, the sacrificial killing of pigs, cockfighting, bats, bananas, coconuts, musical instruments, weights and measures, food, ways of cooking rice, trade, meetings with the tribal leaders, and even male genital ornamentation. Indeed, without this work, our knowledge of our history, language and culture – including those of the Moluccas and other parts of the world — would be very much poorer today. About a full third of the 160 page book describes what is now part of several Visayan islands and Palawan, and no doubt served as a major reference for the Lav Diaz film on Magellan. – Rappler.com",True,true,"[Ilonggo Notes] How we spoke during Magellan’s time, according to The Pigafetta chronicles",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/ilonggo-notes-pigafetta-chronicles-magellan-voyage/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Lopez-led ABS-CBN Corporation confirmed on Thursday, December 4, that it has received a notice from Manny Pangilinan’s TV5 Network terminating its content supply agreement due to money matters. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), the former broadcasting giant insisted that the dispute over the reported P1-billion delayed payments to the Kapatid channel was pending, and that it had sought more time to meet its obligations. ABS-CBN also denied it had “willfully delayed payment,” and asked for understanding given the loss of its lucrative broadcast franchise over five years ago under the Rodrigo Duterte administration. After it lost its broadcast franchise, ABS-CBN pivoted to being a content provider to its former competitors, including TV5 and later GMA Network, plus smaller entities such as Manny Villar’s ALLTV and Eddie Villanueva’s Zoe Broadcasting‘s A2Z that had franchises. It also signed content deals with streaming platforms such as Netflix and Viu, and consolidated its domestic and global streaming platform to iWant. ABS-CBN renewed its content agreement with TV5 in June 2023. Under the five-year deal, ABS-CBN would continue to supply TV5 with shows for its weekday and weekend primetime slots. Among the Kapamilya shows currently on primetime on TV5 are the popular Coco Martin-helmed Batang Quiapo teleserye, and new series Roja and What Lies Beneath. They are also shown on ABS-CBN’s digital platforms such as YouTube. Most ABS-CBN viewers shifted to YouTube and paid cable TV after the Kapamilya broadcast operations shut down. Majority of the poor who couldn’t afford digital services shifted to GMA’s and TV5’s free TV for entertainment and news. (READ: Fewer viewers, ad options: How ABS-CBN shutdown alters PH media landscape) As of Thursday, TV5 told Rappler that ABS-CBN shows will still be aired on the Kapatid channel. TV5 issued a statement late Thursday in response to ABS-CBN’s disclosure, noting that while “TV5 recognizes the value of ABS-CBN’s well-loved programs,” its failure to meet financial commitments “made it very difficult” for TV5 to compensate its employees and talents. “Our Content Agreement with ABS-CBN requires them to remit, on a timely basis, TV5’s share of revenues they collect from advertisers. These amounts collected, our share being held by ABS-CBN for TV5, has reached such material value as to severely affect TV5’s ability to settle its own obligations,” the TV5 statement said. “Despite our repeated appeals, ABS-CBN has failed to pay what is due. Neither have they given assurances, nor indicated, that they can or will.” Publicly listed ABS-CBN, in its statement, said: “…We deeply regret that this action has been taken at this critical juncture in our recovery, particularly as we continue to navigate the unprecedented challenges arising from our franchise loss.” “Contrary to media reports, the amounts and manner of the claims remain disputed. We acknowledge our obligations to TV5 and are doing everything we can to address these payments. We have sought additional time to resolve this matter and are working urgently within the thirty-day period we have been given. “While this timeline is challenging given our current circumstances, we are committed to finding a way to fulfill our obligations — not only to TV5 but to all our partners and stakeholders. We remain open to fair and reasonable solutions that recognize the extraordinary circumstances our company has faced. “There is no truth to any insinuation that ABS-CBN willfully delayed payment. Such characterizations fail to acknowledge the severe financial constraints imposed on us through circumstances beyond our control.” ABS-CBN noted that the loss of its broadcast franchise in May 2020 “significantly reduced its revenues” that it said “was not a matter of choice or mismanagment, but a direct result of regulatory action that stripped away our primary revenue source.” ABS-CBN recorded a net loss of P5.6 billion in 2021, P2.6 billion in 2022, P12.8 billion in 2023, and P6 billion in 2024. It had a net income of P1.9 billion in 2018 or before the COVID-19 pandemic and the broadcast shutdown in 2020. ABS-CBN reported a net loss of P1.6 billion for the first three quarters of 2025, 24% lower than the P2.1 billion net loss in the same period in 2024. Advertising revenue went up from P4.7 billion to P5.4 billion in the first 9 months of 2025, up P694 million or 15% due partly to election-related advertising in the 2025 mid-term polls. In February, the Lopezes decided to sell 30,000 square meters of its 44,027-square-meter property in Sgt. Esguerra, Quezon City to Ayala Land Incorporated for P6.2 billion to pay for its outstanding loans. “While some revenue streams have since recovered, ABS-CBN continues to operate at a loss as we work to rebuild,” ABS-CBN said in its statement. Aside from being a content provider, ABS-CBN shifted its focus to digital operations but the earnings from digital platforms are not enough to make up for the loss in broadcast revenues. “Despite these formidable challenges, our transformation into a storytelling company has shown steady performance improvement, demonstrating our resilience and commitment to our stakeholders. While we are still short of realizing a full turnaround, our trajectory is clear and our dedication unwavering,” ABS-CBN said. In a separate statement to its Kapamilya viewers on Thursday, ABS-CBN said in a social media post that it would find ways to reach them in the event the TV5 partnership is terminated.

"Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer: I hope this message finds you well. I’m writing because I’m struggling with something I can’t seem to make sense of, and I thought you might be the best people to help me unpack it. I recently ghosted someone I had been talking to for a while. This isn’t the first time I’ve done this, but it’s the first time I’ve really felt guilty, probably because we had already made a lot of plans together. There’s another layer to this: I hadn’t told him about my mental health condition. I was previously diagnosed with anxiety disorder, and after a recent check-in with a new psychiatrist (after months off medication), I was given a new diagnosis: bipolar hypomania. That same day, it hit me that I might have been making plans with him simply because the excitement felt good, not because I was fully invested. After processing it with a friend, I realized I might have been dating him not for the relationship itself, but for the thrill of making plans when I wasn’t occupied with work or other things. The truth is, I didn’t see it going very far. So, instead of being honest, I just stopped replying. To make it worse, his last messages were him checking on me because I had told him I was drunk, and I never replied. Now I feel guilty and confused. On one hand, I know I should have communicated better. On the other hand, I felt overwhelmed and afraid that being honest would hurt him even more. Was my silence selfish, protective, or simply cowardly? Why do people ghost? Is it always a sign of immaturity or emotional unavailability? How can I make sense of my own actions and avoid repeating this pattern? And is there a way to make amends, or should I just leave things as they are? Thank you so much for reading this. I would deeply appreciate your insight. Sincerely, Denise Dear Denise, The term ghosting, meaning to stop communication abruptly, is recent but the behavior has been around since human relationships began, and now become more common, perhaps because the internet and social media have made it easier simply to ‘disappear’ without repercussions. As to why people ghost, it’s generally for a number of reasons e.g. fear of confrontation, shame, inability to cope with emotions, difficulty finding the “right” words. The internet has also facilitated the ease with which one can ghost by loosening the sense of engagement and increasing the lack of accountability. Ghosting is essentially a selfish act, all about the ghoster and with no concern for the ghosted who is frequently left bewildered by the sudden silence, unclear as to the reasons and unable to get clarification. To remedy this, Denise, you have options. You could be to explain why you acted as you did, a simple honest statement of your concerns about your condition and its influence on your motivation for all your plans, without asking for forgiveness or suggesting a renewal of the relationship. This might help clarify and enable him to achieve closure and move on. Alternatively, you could remain silent, avoid possibly reopening old wounds and simply learn from this experience. Whatever you choose to do, you should also consider discussing how to manage relationships in the future with your new psychiatrist so that you are better placed to navigate the inevitable peaks and troughs that come with your diagnosis. Finally, practice self-compassion and remember that your goal is progress, not perfection. Best wishes, JAFBaer Dear Denise, Thank you so much for your letter. You asked several important questions in your letter and Mr. Baer has responded to your most important ones. Other unanswered questions include: Is ghosting always a sign of immaturity or emotional unavailability? Absolutely not. Here are some examples of when it might be a good idea to do so: if you are consistently disrespected or manipulated, despite your calling him on it; or if you feel unsafe or uncomfortable. You also asked how you can make sense of your own actions, which is a very valid question and certainly worth answering. In fact, should you write to us again, we would be very happy to. However, sometimes we focus so much on the whys and wherefores of the reasons we did something, that we forget about the person we hurt, confused, and ghosted. Let’s call him “Marvin.” Marvin did not make you feel disrespected, manipulated, unsafe or uncomfortable. In fact, he seems a nice enough guy that you feel “really guilty,” notwithstanding the fact that you’ve ghosted several people in the past. You also liked him enough to have made made a lot of plans together. It’s true that, despite being bipolar, and thus possibly dating him mainly for the thrill of making plans when you weren’t engaged in other activities, you still hurt and confused him. I think you owe this guy an explanation: You do not have to tell him you are bipolar, nor apologize endlessly, but he does deserve an explanation of sorts. True, your explanation might come across as the often quoted “It’s not you, it’s me” when people want to end a relationship, but don’t want to hurt the other person. In this case, however, you would mean it. I also feel that it is probably not being bipolar per se, but the shock of realizing you are now among those who have what is considered (along with schizophrenia) the most virulent and most difficult mental disorder to treat. I don’t blame you. I, too, felt the same when I realized I did not just suffer from clinical depression, but from bipolar disorder. However, that is not Marvin’s fault. What you did was pretty unkind and ego damaging. Surely being bipolar (which you cannot help) is not as bad as being unkind and a contributory factor to a person’s ego being damaged, which you CAN help? There is a meme that goes something like: You do not know what the person is going through or how far he had to travel/suffer before he reached the place he’s in, so be kind. It is understandable that you now feel uncertain and yes, even frightened, about the new diagnosis you’ve been given. Being hypomanic at the moment, it is easy to pooh pooh your ghosting as something we bipolars do. And it can be…especially among those with the kind of bipolar disorder (Bipolar 1) that needs hospitalization to protect oneself or others. But that is not our kind of bipolar disorder, Denise. We can still realize the gravity of what we did once we have come down from our hypomania. We can still make up for what we did, no matter how long ago it was, or how reasonable an explanation we can give for our behavior. One way to manage being bipolar is to take accountability for our actions. You owe it to Marvin, but most of all, to yourself. Getting back to Marvin (even if it is the last time) will make a difference to him. Most of all however, it will make a difference to you, because “kahit na mahirap ang kailangan mong gawin, ginawa mo pa rin (no matter how difficult the task, you had the grit to still do it).” All the very best, MG Holmes – Rappler.com",True,true,"[Two Pronged] Feeling guilty, confused after ghosting a potential love interest",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/two-pronged-ghosted-someone-feeling-guilty-confused/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – In Filipino culture, being “mayabang” has never been a compliment. If anything, it’s a red flag — a warning that someone is arrogant, boastful, and too full of themselves. The truth is, the shadow of colonization never really left us. It still lingers in fractured identities, in the vulnerable conditions Filipinos live in, especially in the very language we speak. So what if being “mayabang” could mean something else? What if it was never arrogance, but confidence twisted by a colonial mindset? What if reclaiming “mayabang” is, in fact, reclaiming pride? For too long, we’ve been taught to measure value and status by what is imported. Products that are local and Filipino-made often get sidelined in favor of the bag or the shirt stamped with a foreign label. This is where Yabang Pinoy raises the flag, leading a consumer revolution that refuses to erase a dynamic culture of language, creativity, and craft. Founded in 2005 by a group of young advocates, the movement has spent two decades proving that Filipino identity can be empowered in the everyday, especially in every peso you spend. “Our greatest accomplishment is the leaders, advocates, and volunteers we have met and worked with along the way,” said Yabang Pinoy head of projects and partnerships JM Jose. “They continue to embody and champion the ‘Filipino First’ mindset, which is the very heart of our movement.” Over the past two decades, Yabang Pinoy has turned that call into programs that nurture the Filipino’s sense of pride and value of community. From their Global Pinoy Bazaar, which transformed from a small community fair into a wider, more diverse showcase of Filipino brands, to initiatives like Philippine Cinema Sessions and Y.A.B.A.N.G. Camp, Yabang Pinoy has built platforms where national identity isn’t just talked about, but seen, heard, and truly lived out. “Whether how bad our politics is, whether how bad the traffic is, whether how bad the weather is, marami pa ring puwede ipagmalaki tayo, ‘di ba?” added Jose. (No matter how bad our politics, our traffic, or even our weather gets, there will always be things we can be proud of, right?) If Gouache tells stories through bags, the iconic Linya-Linya does it through words you can wear. What began as Ali Sangalang’s scribbled jokes made its way to Tumblr, where his punchlines and catchphrases deeply reflect everyday Filipino life. Sangalang never planned to turn those lines into products. But Yabang Pinoy saw the potential and gave him space at the Global Pinoy Bazaar — spreading messages from daily humor, hugot lines, to even bigger realities. “Nag-re-resonate sa mga nakakita, nakakabasa ‘yong lines namin. Dun ko na-realize na ‘di nila binibili yung tela, binibili nila yung linyang nakasulat,” said Sangalang. (The lines we wrote resonated with those who saw and read them. That’s when I realized that they weren’t buying the fabric, they were buying the words printed on it.) A post shared by Linya-Linya (@linyalinya) Linya-Linya flips the idea that pride needs a foreign language or a grand gesture — it can be written in Filipino and lived out in something as simple as the shirt you wear today. From its collaboration with the late novelist Lualhati Bautista in 2020 to its West Philippine Sea collection in 2025, Linya-Linya proves that humor is more than comic relief — it’s important commentary in navigating through danger and fear, especially as Filipinos. “Ganon tayong mga Pilipino eh,” added Sangalang. “Parang pinagtatawanan natin minsan kung ano ‘yong mga pinagdadaanan natin… ‘yong admission na ‘yon, ‘yong acknowledgement ‘yong nagpapakatotoo sa atin.” (We Filipinos are like that. Sometimes we laugh about what we’re going through. . . that admission, that acknowledgment — that’s what makes us real.) That spirit continues in the brand’s collaborations, including this year’s Live Proud shorts with Yabang Pinoy — a vibrant collection that celebrates Filipino pride and identity. For Ann Poco and her husband, Louie, what started as a search for his camera bag became the journey to design one themselves. Soon enough, the couple was already working with Marikina’s artisans — stitching Gouache into life. The name itself comes from the painting technique, where pigments are layered to create an opaque finish that is unique in every waxed canvas. This idea of individuality runs through the core of Filipino identity — each bag carries a story about the people who made it. The couple began building a community of bag makers in Marikina, eventually opening a workshop and showroom where artisans could meet with customers. This exchange, Ann says, was just as important as the products themselves, as it allows makers to see the pride their craft inspires. A post shared by Gouache Waxed Canvas (@gouachebags) Gouache’s story also reveals the challenges of working locally. While the brand has proven that Filipino craftsmanship can rival global standards, sourcing raw materials is another battle. This has meant navigating gaps in production while still designing Philippine-made products that are both functional and beautiful. True consumer revolution, then, doesn’t stop at buying local — it also demands investment in local manufacturing so that pride in craft can extend from the design table to the raw materials. Despite this struggle, Gouache is empowered just by the community it’s crafting for. Even if there are some expectations that Filipino goods are of low quality, Ann noted that this perception is significantly shifting today, thanks to Gen Zs. “Today, especially the youth… they understand now that local does not mean cheap, right? And they like the sense of identity that these articles of clothing, these accessories bring into their lives — it’s the stories,” Ann said. To mark Yabang Pinoy’s 20th anniversary, Gouache has partnered with the movement on a special line of bags, with proceeds funding the planting of 100,000 Bitaog hardwood trees along the Bacnotan Riverway in La Union — trees long valued for shielding coastal communities from flooding and erosion. For the last quarter of 2025, Yabang Pinoy announced several events in support of local brands and communities. The 27th Global Pinoy Bazaar will run from October 2 to 5 at Glorietta in Makati. The 6th PH Cinema Session is set for October 5 and 12 at Linya-Linya HQ in Libis, Quezon City. The Global Pinoy Alabang Fair follows on October 17 to 19 at Alabang Town Center. In November, the 28th Global Pinoy Bazaar will be held on November 20 to 23 at Glorietta 2 in Makati, while the 29th Global Pinoy Bazaar takes place on November 27 to 30 at Shangri-La Plaza in Mandaluyong. Through its talented community of creatives and craftsmen, Yabang Pinoy has helped show that to be “mayabang” is to be brave enough to say: this is who we are, and we are proud to live it. This pride doesn’t need to be big or loud. It can be seen from the bag you sling comfortably over your shoulder, in the shirt you wear proudly on your chest, and in every decision you choose to spend your hard-earned peso on. Now, “mayabang” no longer means arrogance — it’s the courage to wear, carry, and live Filipino proudly. – Jaella Magno/Rappler.com Jaella Magno is a Rappler volunteer and 3rd year AB Literature major in Creative Writing student from De La Salle University.",True,true,Redefining ‘mayabang’: How these Filipino artisans turn pride into power,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/yabang-pinoy-filipino-artisans/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Maine Mendoza has come to the defense of her husband, Quezon City 1st District Representative Juan Carlos “Arjo” Atayde, yet again. Atayde continues to receive public backlash after contractor couple Sarah Discaya and Pacifico “Curlee” Discaya expressed their desire to act as state witnesses in the flood control scandal. The Discaya couple named the actor-turned-politician as one of the 17 public officials who allegedly demanded kickbacks from them. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, September 10, Mendoza maintained her husband’s innocence, attesting that they are honest taxpayers who do not rely on the taxes of the Filipino people to fund their lifestyle. “Both of us (and our families) are financially capable of sustaining the lives that we live, and it’s personally offensive to be accused of spending money that we have rightfully earned outside politics. It’s unfair to reduce everything that we are and everything that we have worked for to that single narrative,” Mendoza wrote. The Eat Bulaga! mainstay said that if Atayde were to ever do anything dishonest, she “certainly wouldn’t defend him and cover for him.” Atayde himself denied the Discayas’ claims in an Instagram story on September 8, saying that he has “never dealt” with the contractor couple. Rappler, however, obtained and published photos of the Topakk actor posing with Curlee and Sarah. An old photo from Atayde’s own Facebook page had also resurfaced — showing him looking at a tarpaulin for a P50-million flood project helmed by Wawao Builders. Atayde has since taken the photo down. Wawao Builders had become one of the top Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) contractors starting 2022. Public Works Secretary Manuel Bonoan earlier stated that they had initial information that some of the firm’s flood control projects in Bulacan were ghost projects. Seemingly alluding to these photos, Mendoza said that they were taken out of context, and asked that the public not forget that “perception is not always reality.” “It is truly distressing to see people suffer in times of crisis because of corrupt politicians who put self-interest above all else, alongside their accomplices. Nakakagalit talaga (It really is infuriating). And we also believe those who are truly guilty should face accountability. Again, the truth will reveal itself in the end. We can only hope and pray that the justice system delivers justice to those who deserve it and to whom it’s due. I know we may be easy targets, but you are condemning the wrong people,” the 30-year-old showbiz personality continued. Mendoza further added that her husband plans to take legal action to clear his name. “Arjo has nothing to hide. He has never been guilty of stealing. I’ll end with this, not all politicians are corrupt — some are just convenient targets. The real villains are celebrating quietly in the shadows,” Mendoza said. This lengthy statement comes after the actress made a brief post on X referring to the Discayas’ claims as “baseless allegations,” asking the public to refrain from spewing hate comments at Atayde “until facts come out.” Atayde was reelected as Quezon City 1st District representative in the 2025 midterm elections.

"Chinese semiconductor company Wingtech said on Monday, October 13, it will take actions to protect its rights and will seek government support, after Dutch authorities ordered an intervention at its Netherlands-based subsidiary Nexperia. On Sunday, the Dutch government said it is intervening at Nexperia, which manufactures computer chips for the car and consumer electronics industries, due to worries about the possible transfer of crucial technology to its parent Wingtech. The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said its intervention was in reaction to administrative shortcomings at the company and would allow it to reverse or block harmful decisions while the company’s regular production may continue. The Dutch move against US-sanctioned Wingtech came after the Trump administration dramatically expanded prohibitions late last month to include subsidiaries of blacklisted companies. Wingtech said in a stock exchange filing that its control over Nexperia will be temporarily restricted due to the Dutch order and court rulings, affecting decision making and operational efficiency. “The company is actively consulting with international law firms on legal remedies and strategies, and will take all necessary actions to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the company and shareholders,” Wingtech said. “We are proactively engaging with relevant government departments to seek their support.” Wingtech’s Shanghai-listed shares plunged 10% on Monday to a one-month low. A Nexperia spokesperson said on Sunday the company adheres to “all existing laws and regulations, export controls and sanction regimes.” Nexperia is one of the world’s largest makers of simple computer chips such as diodes and transistors. The Dutch Economic Affairs Ministry described the intervention, under a law intended to ensure critical goods remain available during an emergency, as “highly exceptional” and noted it could be subject to a court appeal. – Rappler.com",True,true,China’s Wingtech seeks government help after Dutch intervention at Nexperia unit,https://www.rappler.com/technology/wingtech-seeks-china-government-help-dutch-intervention-nexperia/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Renee Nicole Good, who was shot and killed by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent on January 7, was an award-winning poet. Good received her Creative Writing degree from the Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. In 2020, as a student, she won an undergraduate poetry prize from the university’s English department for her piece, “On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs.” The poem sees the mother of three dive deep into existential inquiry, life, and death. Back then, judges for the competition had praised Good for her use of imagery and for being able to seamlessly weave in a vast range of memories to get her point across. “What is the origin story of ‘want;’ the urgency of belief and nonbelief? the first line the poet asks. Through specificity of image and associative leaps from piece to piece emerges a text that in itself becomes a sacred text, a meditation that leads the reader into the unknown,” the judges wrote about her piece. Below is Good’s poem, originally published under poets.org: On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs by Renée Nicole Macklin i want back my rocking chairs, solipsist sunsets, & coastal jungle sounds that are tercets from cicadas and pentameter from the hairy legs of cockroaches. i’ve donated bibles to thrift stores (mashed them in plastic trash bags with an acidic himalayan salt lamp— the post-baptism bibles, the ones plucked from street corners from the meaty hands of zealots, the dumbed-down, easy-to-read, parasitic kind): remember more the slick rubber smell of high gloss biology textbook pictures; they burned the hairs inside my nostrils, & salt & ink that rubbed off on my palms. under clippings of the moon at two forty five AM I study&repeat ribosome endoplasmic— lactic acid stamen at the IHOP on the corner of powers and stetson hills— i repeated & scribbled until it picked its way & stagnated somewhere i can’t point to anymore, maybe my gut— maybe there in-between my pancreas & large intestine is the piddly brook of my soul. it’s the ruler by which i reduce all things now; hard-edged & splintering from knowledge that used to sit, a cloth against fevered forehead. can i let them both be? this fickle faith and this college science that heckles from the back of the classroom now i can’t believe— that the bible and qur’an and bhagavad gita are sliding long hairs behind my ear like mom used to & exhaling from their mouths “make room for wonder”— all my understanding dribbles down the chin onto the chest & is summarized as: life is merely to ovum and sperm and where those two meet and how often and how well and what dies there. Good was killed just a few blocks away from where she was living with her partner in the Twin Cities. She was shot by an ICE agent while inside her SUV. She leaves behind her partner and three kids: a 15-year-old daughter, a 12-year-old son, and a six-year-old.

"Another Villar-owned company has again come under close scrutiny. VistaREIT, Inc. (PSE: VREIT) debuted on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) in 2022, and was heralded as the next great income play for investors looking for high dividends and exposure to the country’s largest integrated property network. Sponsored by billionaire Manuel “Manny” Villar Jr., whose business empire spans real estate, retail, utilities, and financial services, VREIT’s public offering raised nearly ₱5 billion from institutional and retail investors eager for steady yields in the post-pandemic recovery.Today, VREIT’s promise of stability and transparency is crumbling. Behind its glossy earnings reports and reassuring dividend announcements lie troubling inconsistencies in cash flows, accounting treatments, and rent collection — issues that suggest the REIT’s growth story may be built on precarious foundations.VREIT’s shares have plummeted to ₱1.30 as of October 10, 2025 — down 30.5% in just three months — and its current touted dividend yield of 14.2% is now overshadowed by concerns that the company is paying out more than it earns. VREIT is 64.6% owned by Fine Properties, Inc., the Villar family’s private holding company. Fine Properties also controls Villar Land Holdings (PSE: HVN) and Vista Land & Lifescapes (PSE: VLL), both critical pieces of the Villar real estate ecosystem. The structure creates a circular flow of transactions: VLL leases properties from VREIT, which earns rental income from VLL and other Villar-related tenants, such as AllDay Supermarkets, AllHome, Coffee Project, and AllBank. On paper, this looks like a robust ecosystem. In practice, it blurs the line between genuine third-party revenue and internal transfers that rely on Villar companies paying rent to each other. When the paying entities themselves delay or fail to pay — while still being treated as “current” receivables — VREIT’s financial independence is called into question. In a message sent to Rappler, VREIT says the majority of the company’s receivables pertain to future rental escalations: “These amounts are not yet due and will only be billed upon the application of the relevant escalation rates, in accordance with the terms of our lease agreements. As required under Philippine Accounting Standards (PAS) 17, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which includes future escalation amounts. “This results in a timing difference between revenue recognition and actual cash collection, as a portion of the revenue recognized consists of unbilled rental income tied to future rent increases. Since these are contractually guaranteed and not yet due, no allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against them. “These accounting treatments do not affect the Company’s distributable income or its ability to pay dividends. Items, such as receivables related to future rental escalations, along with fair value gains or losses, are excluded from distributable income calculations. As such, they have no bearing on the dividends declared. “Since 2022, our dividend payouts have followed an upward trend, aligned with our improving financial performance. For full year 2024, we declared and paid dividends representing a 6.77% increase over FY2023, reflecting both our operational strength and prudent financial management.” The statement mirrors the company’s technical accounting disclosure which explains that part of its receivables and revenues are not yet actual cash — a nuance that can easily confuse investors. Let’s unpack it forensically and analytically: In the polished language of corporate disclosure, VREIT is saying that its “majority of receivables pertain to future rental escalations.” The line looks harmless enough — until you realize what it really means: That a sizable portion of its declared income doesn’t yet exist in cash form. Under PAS (Philippine Accounting Standards) 17, rental income must be recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This is a technical way of saying that VREIT records future rent increases as today’s revenue. Yes, it smooths out earnings, but it also makes profits look richer and steadier than the cash that actually enters its coffers. Imagine a tenant paying ₱100,000 a month with a 5% annual escalation for five years. Instead of recording ₱100k in year one and ₱105k in year two, accounting rules tell VREIT to average the entire lease — say, ₱115k monthly across all years. On paper, that looks prudent. In reality, VREIT is booking income it hasn’t billed, much less collected. Those unbilled amounts sit under receivables, which the company assures are contractually guaranteed by Fine Properties, the parent company of Vista Land & Lifescapes, Inc. and Golden MV Holdings, Inc. That guarantee, therefore, is only as strong as the group’s internal cash flow. This accounting quirk creates a widening gap between reported income and actual operating cash. An investor should immediately ask: if VREIT’s income keeps rising, while its cash from operations lags, who’s paying for the difference? When the REIT declares dividends — based on distributable income rather than accrued income — the pressure builds. Unless the tenants catch up in real pesos, VREIT may be paying investors from cash borrowed, not earned. No allowance for doubtful accounts is booked against these unbilled receivables. This is because technically they’re “not yet due.” But that assumption hinges on perfect tenant performance. Should any related tenant falter — say, if AllHome or AllDay stumbles in retail sales — those “future escalations” could be quietly renegotiated or deferred.In short, what looks like a guaranteed receivable could easily become a paper promise. The Villar property universe operates like a closed loop: the landlord (VREIT) leases to the developer (Vista Land) and its affiliates, who, in turn, drive traffic to the malls which VREIT owns. It’s not only a vertically integrated empire, it’s also a circular system of self-guarantee. When a REIT’s income depends on affiliates’ ability to pay, the risk ceases to be about tenants — it becomes about the group’s overall liquidity. At first glance, VREIT’s earnings appear spectacular. After a reported ₱9.6 billion loss in 2022, the company swung to ₱2.5 billion in 2023 and ₱5.0 billion in 2024, maintaining similar levels through mid-2025. To the casual investor, that suggests rapid profitability and operational recovery.However, the company’s own disclosures tell a different story. VREIT’s financials were heavily distorted by large one-off items and asset revaluations, totaling: Once these non-recurring items are stripped away, the core picture becomes far less flattering. VREIT’s cash from operations — the most reliable measure of actual business performance — has barely turned positive: In other words, despite reporting billions in “profits,” the company’s operations generated less than ₱400 million in real cash in the past twelve months — barely a fraction of its declared dividends. VREIT currently boasts a 14.2% dividend yield — one of the highest in the Philippine market. Yet, this headline figure is deeply misleading. The dividends are not covered by either earnings or cash flow: In practical terms, this means that for every peso VREIT earns in cash, it pays out ₱3.64 in dividends. Such payouts are unsustainable, unless funded by debt, asset sales, or fresh capital injections — all of which erode shareholder value over time.This strategy may keep investors complacent in the short term, but it dangerously masks the underlying liquidity shortfall. Beyond accounting optics, the straight-line rental recognition policy ripples through key valuation metrics — quietly altering the way investors perceive performance and stability. 1. NAV (Net Asset Value) Inflation Unbilled rent receivables from future escalations appear under current assets. This inflates total assets and, therefore, artificially boosts NAV per share. However, since these receivables cannot be liquidated or pledged for financing, they function more like deferred gains rather than real wealth. Forensic verdict: NAV overstated by the value of non-cash rent accruals — likely in the hundreds of millions. 2. Dividend Yield Distortion REITs are prized for high dividend yields. But if dividends are funded by accrued — not collected — income, the yield figure becomes mathematically inflated but economically hollow. Investors may think they’re earning 7–8% annually, when in fact, cash-backed yield could be closer to 5–6%. 3. Debt-service coverage risk Because income is front-loaded on paper, financial ratios like interest coverage or debt-service coverage look healthier than they truly are. When cash flow trails far behind accounting income, the margin for debt repayment tightens. In a tightening credit environment, lenders watch this metric closely — and may reprice loans or demand higher collateral. 4. Tenant concentration multiplier Roughly 80% of VREIT’s tenants are Villar-controlled entities. If even one affiliate delays payment, the entire REIT cycle is disrupted. That makes VREIT’s risk systemic within its own ecosystem. It is true that VREIT’s disclosure complies with PAS 17. It’s clean accounting — but aggressive optics. It allows the company to show stable, growing income even if actual collections trail behind. For ordinary investors, the lesson is clear: VREIT presents itself as a stable, high-yield property trust — but its accounting structure reveals earnings inflated by unbilled, non-cash rent accruals recognized under PAS 17. This raises liquidity, valuation, and related-party exposure concerns. Core accounting issue Quantitative indicators (mid-2025 estimates) Forensic red flags VistaREIT’s income is front-loaded, its cash is lagging, and its guarantees are circular. The REIT’s apparent stability is built on accrued future rents — accounting profits that have yet to arrive as cash. In a market hungry for yield, Villar’s VREIT shines as a steady earner on paper. But a forensic read tells another story: one of timing differences, intra-group dependencies, and valuation fantasies that make the REIT’s strength look better than it feels.

"What is your sign? If you can answer that question, you are one of the 90% of adults who know your zodiac sign. This is no surprise: the media, social networks, and digital applications have all recently given a new push to astrology. In contrast, in a survey conducted in the United States, only 57% of respondents knew their blood type. What makes astrology so special? Astrology is defined as the study of the position and movement of the stars as a means of predicting future events and finding out about people’s character. It originated in Babylon around the year 700-450 BC, when the 12 zodiac signs were established – with their interpretation focused on predicting events in the population. It was in ancient Greece where predictions were transferred to individuals and were made based on the relative position of the stars at the time of birth. For example, the fact that a person is a Gemini means that, at the time of their birth, the Sun (projected in the sky) was in the position that aligned with the Gemini constellation. The Earth, when revolving around the Sun, makes its way through the different constellations. That path is known as the ecliptic plane. The sun sign, according to astrologers, represents our personality, self-perception, love compatibility, and basic preferences. Thus, studying the position of the celestial bodies can help us choose better friends, suitable love relationships, and make better decisions both professionally and financially. There are at least three reasons why your zodiac sign is most likely not what you think. In 1996, an experiment was published in which 44 astrologers tried to match the birth data (date, time, and place) of seven anonymous people with their respective personality questionnaires. The questionnaires were taken from the Berkeley University Personality Profile, and there were other questions also included suggested by the 44 astrologers. Aspects related to education, family, vocation, hobbies, personality, relationships, health, etc. were covered. The astrologer who managed to correctly match the seven anonymous people’s birth data with their respective questionnaires would win $2,500. The results were disappointing for astrology: the most skilled astrologer had 3 correct matches out of 7, and half of the participants (22) did not have a single correct answer. There are several articles that put astrology and its predictive power to the test. Spoiler alert: astrology fails every time. An astrologer has the same chances of being right about aspects of our future as anyone else who bases their responses on chance. There are people who decide on their partner based on the zodiac signs. Nevertheless, it seems that love is not dictated by the stars. A study carried out with 10 million marriages in England and Wales showed that there is no evidence of attraction (or rejection) between the different zodiac signs. Although it is well proven that astrology does not get things right, 27% of Americans and 23% of the French believe in it, while 46% of Mexicans feel that their horoscope is something important in their lives. Why is that? Astrology is an extremely profitable business. In the United States alone, astrology apps brought in $40 million for their creators in 2019. This makes astrology be promoted even more online, and more and more people are getting into the market. But the most interesting thing in all this is that humans are prone to errors and biases related with judgement and reasoning. This means that horoscopes fit into our mental mechanisms. Specifically, they rely on what we know as confirmation bias and the Barnum effect. Confirmation bias shows that prior beliefs and expectations can influence the selection, retention, and evaluation of evidence; that is, we look for information that supports our ideas and ignore information that contradicts them. For example, if our horoscope mentions that “it will be a day of strong contrasts” and we have a very calm day, we will simply ignore that prediction. However, if we really do have a day of contrasts, the first thing we will think is, “Of course, the horoscope warned me.” The Barnum effect is a psychological phenomenon that consists of perceiving general and ambiguous descriptions (applicable to everyone) as if they were highly precise statements (made specifically for us). In 1968, French psychologist Michel Gauquelin published a newspaper ad. In exchange for one’s name, address, date of birth and place of birth, he offered a 10-page personalized horoscope free of charge. A real bargain! After receiving the horoscope, 94% of those who had sent in their information said they were satisfied with the results, with 90% even stating that their relatives had found the descriptions of their profile to be correct. Where is the catch? They had all received the same text! The horoscope sent out by Michel Gauquelin was that of a serial killer born in France on January 17, 1897. Horoscopes promise certainty (“our fate is in the stars”). Therefore, it is not surprising that people usually turn to horoscopes in times of great uncertainty. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, searches related to horoscopes had their highest peak in years. The aim of this article is not for people to stop reading horoscopes, because they can be an excellent source of entertainment and fun. Nonetheless, we must emphasize that there is no connection between the position of the stars and our lives. And although horoscopes seem harmless fun, we must remember that French President Charles de Gaulle, Queen Elizabeth I of England and Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi all had astrologers to help them make decisions during their tenures. Just remember that Cassius said to Brutus (in Julius Caesar, by William Shakespeare): The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars. – Rappler.com Yersain Ely Keller de la Rosa is Maestro en Ciencias Bioquímicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM).

"MANILA, Philippines – Filipino families have always gravitated toward shared spaces — from weekend mall trips to long meals and hours of conversation in their favorite restaurant. These habits are shaping how restaurants and entertainment brands are designing their spaces. The rise of “eatertainment” spots like Dave & Buster’s — a US chain that landed in Manila in October — shows how dining out is evolving into a fuller, all-in-one social experience, catering to every member of the family, regardless of age. Known for combining dining, arcade games, and sports viewing under one roof, Dave & Buster’s opened its first Philippine branch at OPUS Mall in Bridgetowne, Quezon City. It’s The Bistro Group’s latest venture, and nothing too out of its spectrum; the group operates familiar, casual dining names like TGI Friday’s, Texas Roadhouse, Denny’s, and Hard Rock Cafe. “We saw how the local market has grown to seek holistic experiences. It’s not just about eating out anymore; people want energy, excitement, and variety in one space,” said Jean Paul Manuud, president of The Bistro Group. “Entering the ‘eatertainment’ sector with a renowned global brand like Dave & Buster’s is an exciting development for us.” Sprawled across the third level of OPUS Mall, the new branch is bold and vivid with its neon-lit facade and expansive layout. On one side is a spacious dining area — complete with VIP rooms, electronic darts, billiard tables, and a sports bar with massive LED screens. At certain hours, the staff break into energetic dance routines, adding to the venue’s upbeat atmosphere and energetic essence (note: the sound level can get loud). The fare leans towards classic American — think burgers, sliders, wings, pasta, and pizzas — but with local touches. There’s a sisig flatbread pizza, crisp and cheesy with just the right chew and spice, as well as shareable, pica-pica platters for game nights or group dinners. Cocktails and mocktails flow from the bar, where the servers emulate the chirpy energy of their US counterparts. The other half of the establishment is devoted to the buzzing arcade, where a mix of nostalgic games, high-tech additions, and imported games can be found: Addams Family, E-Claw Cosmic Crane, Mario Kart DX, Water Gun Fun, Goatz and Ropes, Stepmaniax Arcade De Luxe by Step Revolution, Super Blaster by Trio Tech; NBA Superstar Worldwide by Raw Thrills; Water Gun Pixel by Bob Space Racer and Goatz and Rope by Baytek, Godzilla VR, and the new Fast & Furious Arcade with Dual Monitor. Instead of the usual token system, guests can load credits onto a card and redeem prizes at the Win Zone. Antonio Bautista, chief international development officer at Dave & Buster’s, described it as an “all-in-one offering.” “It’s a multi-dimensional experience, and it excites all the senses,” he added. Parents can grab a drink while the kids play, or groups can cheer on a finals game over wings and other things. “It’s for everybody,” Manuud added. This marks Dave & Buster’s first Southeast Asia branch, after being founded in 1982 in Coppell, Texas. There are 152 Dave & Buster’s branches across 41 US states, Puerto Rico, and Canada. – Rappler.com",True,true,Dinner and darts: PH’s first Dave & Buster’s brings ‘eatertainment’ to Filipino diners,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/dave-and-busters-quezon-city-branch-diners/,Rappler
"From the beginning, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) was structurally bound to fail: it was created to be both the engineering and construction arm of the government. In particular, it was responsible for “planning, designing, constructing, and maintaining” major public infrastructures, particularly national roads, bridges, and flood control systems. Under this concept, the DPWH was created as “the law enforcer, judge and executioner” all rolled into one in all big and small projects under its ambit. It was given a broad mandate to plan, design, construct and maintain public infrastructures — a sweeping job description that overlooked the principle of check and balance to eliminate conflict of interest, collusion or impunity. Its function to plan and design were combined with the job to construct and undertake maintenance tasks. This served as the fundamental anomaly for the abuses. The solution is to reorganize the DPWH with its functions centered on the engineering task, as in planning and designing only. Like before, the DPWH will undertake the planning and designing of all infrastructure projects. These include conducting preliminary surveys, investigations, and detailed engineering studies. Its mandate to provide technical services and assistance to other government agencies and local government units (LGUs) for their own infrastructure projects will be retained. It will also retain its job to set standards: the development and enforcement of standards, codes, and guidelines to ensure the safety and quality of both public and private construction. While it will retain its oversight powers, its construction and maintenance function over public works projects will be totally taken away. This is the first step in a series of measures recommended to make the government’s architecture following how graft and corruption have massively and extensively destroyed the department in its latest and most serious scandal. To reiterate: the strategy of the reorganization is to separate the planning and designing function of DPWH from its construction and maintenance mandate, which has to be distributed and/or assigned to existing government departments or agencies whose scope of work may logically and appropriately discharge them. This may redound to substantial savings by government from the DPWH’s present heavy bureaucratic structure, too. The operating concept of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) appears to be the ideal model for the reorganized operation of the DPWH. This suggestion is not with logical reason for the DOTr’s primary role is to plan, develop, and regulate a coordinated network of transportation infrastructure for air, land, and sea. Like the DPWH, its goal is to provide efficient, safe, and reliable services for both people and goods. The DOTr is also tasked with the crucial role of fostering economic growth in its role in connecting the islands of the country — a role that is also inherent for the DPWH relative to the planning and designing of big-ticket public infrastructure projects like roads, bridges, regional hospitals, gymnasiums, and tertiary school buildings emanating from the requirements of the DOTr, Department of Education (DepEd) and the Department of Health (DOH). The DPWH will continue to work with the local government units in the identification of local infrastructure projects. However, the construction and maintenance of local projects like secondary roads, farm-to-market roads, local bridges, elementary and secondary local school buildings, municipal and city public markets and abattoirs, will be given to the local government units but still under the oversight control of the DPWH. While the DPWH will retain technical oversight function in the implementation and/or maintenance of the projects, it will no longer have the power to dispense the funding of the projects. The source of funding will be lodged in the budget of the project proponents like the DOTr, Department of Education (DOE) or the Department of Health (DOH). This strategy may work out better to enhance the country’s capability to adapt to the changing conditions to advance and grow. Considering that it’s still practical to tap outside resources than build in-house capability that would unnecessarily bloat the size of the government’s bureaucracy in the face of the large number of public works needing simultaneous attention across the country, the construction and maintenance of public works projects may still have to be contracted with the private sector. However, the DPWH will no longer have the power or influence in selecting contractors. This will be taken away for the obvious reason that this was exploited and abused before. To avoid collusion and conspiracy in the DPWH, the bidding and vetting process of contractors will be assigned and given to an independent third party such as the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Center of the Philippines (to borrow the suggestion of a veteran colleague) or by an existing or new agency with strict and strong vetting powers and independent character. The planning and designing all the way to the construction and maintenance of flood control systems will be an entirely different story. The planning and designing function for flood control systems could be transferred to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). The DENR has the necessary theoretical orientation and practical exposure with regard to understanding the nature of water, the waterways, and of floods and their control. The DPWH never seemed to be effective in this area. In what it has done, the DPWH appeared to look at water and floods as more of a nemesis — like “something to be feared and fought rather than as an ally to be managed,” borrowing the constructive view of former Albay 2nd District representative Joey Sarte Salceda about water and floods as a resource to be harvested, stored, and used in connection with the recent inauguration by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Calunasan Small Reservoir Irrigation Project in Bohol that will irrigate 300 hectares, benefiting some 400 farmers. We could copy the American model for the construction and maintenance of water resources, waterways and flood control programs. The function is not bidded out to the private sector but is exclusively assigned to the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), since water is regarded as a national strategic resource in the United States. The USACE is assigned the dual role to handle civil and military functions: in the military context, the Corps build and destroy obstacles, clear routes for troop movement, and support combat operations; for civil purposes, it is given the task to construct and maintain structures to mitigate flooding, such as the construction of dikes, floodways, and pumping stations. The USACE is as well tasked with the construction of roads and fortifications, managing waterways, providing hydropower, and responding to natural disasters and hazardous waste cleanup, managing major public works, protection of wetlands and groundwater, and the maintenance of numerous hydroelectric plants. Sometimes, as you may have heard, the USACE is sent overseas to assist other nations in building essential infrastructure like hospitals and schools. By giving the function to construct and maintain flood control systems to the engineering corps of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, this will not just augment and upgrade its capability to a higher level of efficiency and readiness to serve both our soldiers and our people, it will also essentially serve as a novel solution to break the wanton embezzlement of flood control funds — estimated at the outrageous amount of P300 billion. – Rappler.com (The article has been prepared for general circulation for the reading public and must not be construed as an offer, or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or financial instruments whether referred to herein or otherwise.

"BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – The Baguio City government is preparing to file a court case seeking to compel the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) to turn over the 247-hectare John Hay Special Economic Zone (JHSEZ), citing unpaid revenue shares and the termination of BCDA’s lease with its former private developer. Mayor Benjamin Magalong said the City Legal Office is finalizing the case, which will ask the courts to enforce provisions of Resolution 362, Series of 1994, the ordinance that laid down 19 conditions governing the redevelopment of Camp John Hay. “We are already preparing the case. Our legal officers are coordinating closely to ensure that it is solid before filing,” Magalong said in a recent briefing. City officials said the legal action will be anchored on two developments: (1) BCDA’s alleged failure to fully remit the city’s mandated revenue shares from John Hay operations, and (2) the termination of the lease contract between BCDA and Camp John Hay Development Corporation (CJHDevCo). The lease was effectively terminated after the Supreme Court upheld a 2015 arbitral ruling ordering CJHDevCo to vacate the property, affirming the government’s reclamation of Camp John Hay. According to the city government, the lease termination triggered Conditionality No. 16 of Resolution 362, which provides that once the lease expires, the John Hay property and all improvements “shall be turned over to the City Government of Baguio without compensation.” Baguio Representative Mauricio G. Domogan, a former mayor who helped frame Resolution 362 in the 1990s, has publicly urged the city to invoke Conditionality 16 as the legal basis for turnover. Domogan said the Supreme Court ruling effectively ended BCDA’s authority to continue holding the property under a private lease arrangement and should result in the reversion of the JHSEZ to the city. “The lease has lapsed. The condition is clear: the property and improvements should be turned over to the city,” Domogan said in an earlier interview. He said he has been coordinating with the city’s legal team and supports the filing of the case. The planned suit is part of a broader dispute between the city government and BCDA over compliance with the 19 conditionalities, several of which the city says remain unfulfilled nearly three decades after they were imposed. City officials have said BCDA still owes ₱225 million in unpaid revenue shares under Conditionalities 9 and 10, which entitle Baguio City to a percentage of gross income and lease revenues generated within the JHSEZ. The city says it has sent at least four demand letters since 2023 seeking payment, but has received no commitment from BCDA to settle the outstanding amount. The move to compel turnover comes amid long-standing tensions between the city government and BCDA over control, revenues, and governance of Camp John Hay. Aside from revenue sharing, unresolved issues include the segregation of barangays within the reservation and the city’s role in reviewing redevelopment plans for the estate. City officials have said they want the courts to finally clarify the respective rights and obligations of the local government and BCDA, particularly in light of the Supreme Court ruling and the city’s standing ordinance. As of writing, BCDA has not issued a public statement responding to the city’s plan to seek judicial intervention. The John Hay Management Corporation, BCDA’s estate manager, has also yet to comment. Magalong said the case will be filed once the legal team completes its review, stressing that the city is pursuing the matter through legal channels “to protect Baguio’s rights under the law.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Baguio City readies court case to compel BCDA to turn over Camp John Hay,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/luzon/baguio-city-readies-court-case-compel-bcda-turn-over-camp-john-hay/,Rappler
"PARIS, France – Thieves in balaclavas broke into Paris’ Louvre museum on Sunday, October 19, using a crane to smash an upstairs window, then stealing priceless objects from an area that houses the French crown jewels before escaping on motorbikes, officials said. The robbery raises awkward questions about security at the museum, where officials had already sounded the alarm about lack of investment at a world-famous site, home to artworks such as the Mona Lisa, that welcomed 8.7 million visitors in 2024. “The theft committed at the Louvre is an attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our History,” President Emmanuel Macron said on X. “We will recover the works, and the perpetrators will be brought to justice.” The thieves struck at about 9:30 am (0730 GMT) when the museum had already opened its doors to the public, and entered the Galerie d’Apollon building, Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on BFM TV. The robbery took between six to seven minutes and was carried out by four people who were unarmed, but who threatened the guards with angle grinders, she said. A total of nine objects were targeted by the criminals, and eight were actually stolen. The thieves lost the ninth one, the crown of Napoleon III’s wife, Empress Eugenie, during their escape, Beccuau said. “It’s worth several tens of millions of euros — just this crown. And it’s not, in my opinion, the most important item,” Drouot auction house President Alexandre Giquello told Reuters. Beccuau said it was a mystery why the thieves did not steal the Regent diamond, which is housed in the Galerie d’Apollon and is estimated to be worth more than $60 million by Sotheby’s. “I don’t have an explanation,” she said. “It’ll only be when they’re in custody and face investigators that we’ll know what type of order they had and why they didn’t target that window.” Beccuau said one of the thieves was wearing a yellow reflective vest, which investigators have since recovered. She added that the robbers tried and failed to set fire to the crane, mounted on the back of a small truck, as they fled. Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said the probe had been entrusted to a specialized police unit that has a high success rate in cracking high-profile robberies. Investigators were keeping all leads open, Beccuau said. But she said it was likely the robbery was either commissioned by a collector, in which case there was a chance of recovering the pieces in a good state, or undertaken by thieves interested only in the valuable jewels and precious metals. She said foreign interference was not among the main hypotheses. “We’re looking at the hypothesis of organized crime,” she said, adding that it could be thieves working on spec for a buyer, or seeking to get access to jewels that can be useful to launder criminal proceeds. “Nowadays, anything can be linked to drug trafficking, given the significant sums of money obtained from drug trafficking.” The Louvre, the world’s most-visited museum, said on X it would remain closed for the day for “exceptional reasons.” Joan and Jim Carpenter, from Santa Cruz, California, said they had been moved out of a gallery just as they were about to see the Mona Lisa. “Well, when you rob the Louvre, that’s a big deal to all of France, so I knew something was up because of the way they swept the whole museum,” Joan Carpenter said. The Mona Lisa was stolen from the museum in 1911 in one of the most daring art thefts in history, in a heist involving a former employee. He was eventually caught and the painting was returned to the museum two years later. Earlier this year, officials at the Louvre requested urgent help from the French government to restore and renovate the museum’s ageing exhibition halls and better protect its countless works of art. Macron, writing on X, said that a new government plan for the Louvre announced in January “provides for strengthened security.” Culture Minister Rachida Dati said the issue of museum security was not new. “For 40 years, there was little focus on securing these major museums, and two years ago, the president of the Louvre requested a security audit from the police prefect. Why? Because museums must adapt to new forms of crime,” she said. “Today, it’s organized crime — professionals.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Thieves rob priceless jewels from Paris’ Louvre in brazen heist,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/louvre-paris-rob-jewels-heist/,Rappler
"Happy New Year! With President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. failing to sign the national budget, we are entering 2026 with a “reenacted budget,” if only for a few days or weeks. This is set to be the first reenacted budget since 2019. In that year, the budget was also stymied by controversies and frictions surrounding pork allocations and insertions. Old governance problems are hounding us in 2026. What led to the 2019 reenacted budget? For starters, former budget secretary Benjamin Diokno was accused by the late representative Rolando Andaya of inserting at least P2.8 billion of infrastructure budgets that will benefit Casiguran, Sorsogon. Why Casiguran? Its mayor then was the husband of the mother-in-law of Diokno’s daughter, while Sorsogon’s vice governor then was the mother-in-law of Diokno’s daughter. This and other budget insertions were allegedly facilitated by Amenah Pangandaman, Diokno’s closest budget undersecretary, who was said to have given a thumb drive to a Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) staff member containing a list of P51 billion worth of infrastructure projects. Total insertions that year allegedly reached P75 billion. Eerily, this brings to mind the recent and alleged tug-of-war of files between Representative Leandro Leviste and the late public works undersecretary Catalina Cabral. Cabral was said to possess a list of projects that are “allocable” to lawmakers, and Representative Leviste allegedly snatched those files from Cabral’s office back in September 2025. Leviste said such files were given to him, not stolen. At any rate, it’s quite clear that the budget of the Department of Public Works and Highways is a crucial entry point of politicians’ pork, then and now. Going back to 2019, Diokno vehemently denied the allegations levelled against him by Andaya. But not long after, Diokno stepped down and moved on to become the governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (a golden parachute). He brought with him Pangandaman to the BSP. Incidentally, both would figure prominently in the early Cabinet of President Marcos Jr.: in 2022, Diokno returned as finance secretary, while Pangandaman became budget secretary — until she resigned recently, in November 2025, amid the flood control scandal. Former House speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo also inserted tons of pork in the 2019 budget for her own legislative district, amounting to P2.4 billion. Reacting to this, Senator Leila de Lima, who was detained at Camp Crame at the behest of former president Rodrigo Duterte, said in a dispatch, “It is scandalous and shameless, but hardly a surprise. We do not expect anything less from Speaker Arroyo who, during her rule as President, was known for putting self-interest above public service.” What’s more, even after the 2019 budget bicameral conference committee or bicam, the House managed to play around with the Department of Health’s budget, specifically its Health Facilities Enhancement Program or HFEP. This is highly anomalous, because Congress ought to stick with the draft bill approved by the bicam. But the House allegedly distributed the P4.5 billion allotted to the House of Representatives, chopping up that pork budget and allocating it among its members. Supposedly, much of that fund went to Arroyo’s allies (supporters of her House leadership), while a much smaller amount went to non-allies. In total, as much as P75 billion of projects were realigned after the bicam under the Local Infrastructure Program. This maneuver led to a budget impasse, led by Senator Panfilo Lacson, a known fiscalizer. The country entered 2019 with no new budget, and in March 2019 president Duterte met with congressional leaders to fix the deadlock. It was only later that month that the Senate submitted the enrolled bill, albeit with “strong reservations.” In mid-April 2019, Duterte finally signed the budget, literally unceremoniously (journalists were only informed by text message that Duterte had already signed the bill). But Duterte ended up vetoing as much as P95.3 billion worth of DPWH projects that were “not part of [his] priority projects,” and assigned some projects for “conditional implementation.” These include “the allowance and benefits of teachers and creation of teaching positions, construction of evacuation centers, funding for foreign-assisted projects, revolving fund, and lump-sum appropriations for capital outlays, as well as financial assistance to local government units and funding requirements of our foreign service.” Fast-forward to 2026, pork hobbles the budget once more, specifically pork lodged under the DPWH. House lawmakers tried their darndest to insert projects under the DPWH, not under flood control but mainly for farm-to-market roads (now to be overseen by the Department of Agriculture) and the HFEP (which also plays a role now — an echo to the 2019 controversy). In a highly irregular move, DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon also appeared before the bicam to lobby the restoration of P54 billion worth of funding. This intervention by the executive created an impasse and the Senate stood its ground, leading to a full stoppage of the bicam proceedings. Eventually, the Senate allowed a partial restoration of the DPWH budget. The ball is now with President Marcos, and as I write this the Palace is scrutinizing the enrolled budget bill for 2026. What should he do? If he’s really committed to show the people that he’s reforming the budget (the root of all evil, so to speak), he might take a leaf from what former president Rodrigo Duterte did in 2019, and veto tons of needless pork projects that they’re not part of his priorities. Back in December 2024, Marcos vetoed P194 billion, P168.240 billion of which were unprogrammed funds and the rest (P26.065 billion) were DPWH projects. For the 2026 budget, he will most likely veto a portion of the P243-billion unprogrammed funds as well. But this will do nothing, really, because unprogrammed appropriations can’t be spent on unless there are excess revenues or new loans. If Marcos is really sincere, he will push for reforms to remove unprogrammed funds entirely in the 2027 budget and beyond. Cases have been filed before the Supreme Court to rule unprogrammed funds unconstitutional (because of the way they have been abused in the budget process). But Marcos will do well to move ahead of this Supreme Court decision and push Congress to pass a law banning unprogrammed funds forever. But I doubt this will happen. If he were really sincere, he would’ve done so years ago, and stop related perversions like the plundering of the coffers of PhilHealth and the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation. Also, Marcos knows that bringing home pork projects is the primary game played in the House of Representatives, and his relatives benefitted from this scheme of late. In fact, a report of the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) found that a big bulk of “allocable” projects went to Marcos’ son Sandro and cousin Martin Romualdez. All in all, the 2026 budget is more of the same. They removed flood control allocations but made up for it in other ways. But truth be told, I’m not really disappointed: in the first place, I didn’t have my hopes up that significant reforms will take place. – Rappler.com Dr. JC Punongbayan is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of False Nostalgia: The Marcos “Golden Age” Myths and How to Debunk Them.

"MANILA, Philippines – Basketball was supposed to be his bread and butter. He envisioned himself playing for a long time in the professional league. But at the age of 30, Benedict Fernandez had no other choice but to hang up his sneakers after getting cut from the team roster just a couple of days before the opening of another PBA season. The turn of events prompted him to pack up his life in Manila and move back to Baguio City. Pondering on his next steps, Benedict decided to put up a restaurant with his then wife April, who comes from a business-oriented family. By February 2014, they set up Grumpy Joe, an American-Italian restaurant offering comfort food. It’s “a risk,” Benedict admitted, as they set up the restaurant on the second floor of a government-owned property along Leonard Wood Road in Baguio. From waking up early to hit the market for supplies to working as a cashier, barista, waiter and dishwasher, the Fernandez couple enjoyed the start of something they deemed promising. Benedict’s uncle, a former chef from another restaurant, joined them and eventually helped create and develop Grumpy Joe’s menu. The Fernandez’s resto venture proved to be a hit. But as it turned out, all the success from their new business came with a price. In a span of three months in 2015, Benedict lost his wife and unborn child on separate occasions. The difficult period had him searching for answers. “Wala akong ginawa kung hindi mag-isip. Ang dami kong questions. In my past life as a basketball player, alam kong madami akong nagawang mali at pinagsisihan ko yun,” Benedict said. “Umabot ako sa point na tinatakwil ko na rin ang Diyos. Sinasabi ko sa kanya, ako na lang ang kunin, wag lang ang mag-ina ko.” (All I did was think. I had so many questions. In my past life as a basketball player, I know I made a lot of mistakes, and I regretted them. I turned away from God. I kept saying that it should have been me who had been taken instead.) Benedict would later drown himself in alcohol, isolating himself from people. Being a local, the people in Baguio who knew what he was going through would often see him aimlessly walking around the city, grieving, but many let him be. As he grieved the early loss of the important people in his life, Benedict eventually picked himself up and decided to focus again on the growing business he and his late wife put up. While getting partners or other people to help him run the restaurant wasn’t an option at first, the former athlete soon realized that he needed a bigger team, and how it would help to have more people by his side to give inputs and insights. Not long after, Benedict met his now fiancee Michelle, who would later help him manage and expand the business. It wasn’t a smooth ride, though, as their personal and working relationship got met with a lot of disapproval. “People judged her left and right. Pero hindi nila alam, malaki ang naitulong niya (But many didn’t know that she played a big part) to help grow Grumpy Joe today,” he said. Benedict admits that he initially didn’t defend Michelle from all the negative things thrown at her at the beginning of their partnership. He eventually realized his shortcomings, made up for it, and soon, he said, “things just aligned.” Michelle, who hails from La Union, paved the way for the first Grumpy Joe branch outside the City of Pines. “Michelle, she has an eye for interior design,” Benedict shared. “Our branches, she’s in charge of the interiors.” After Grumpy Joe managed to stay afloat during the pandemic, Benedict opened their Upper Session Road branch as their Gibraltar location could no longer accommodate the volume of patrons. Soon, he also opened the restaurant for franchise, granting it to an interested party that has been wooing them. That branch opened in San Fernando, Pampanga in 2022. Grumpy Joe also opened in La Union and Dagupan, aside from the two in Baguio, all owned by the Fernandez couple. Benedict said they have intentionally expanded their restaurant only in the northern provinces. Their newest branch to date is a sprawling two-story establishment nestled along Friendship Highway in Angeles City, Pampanga. Apart from the massive 300-seating capacity, this location also boasts a separate commissary building at the back, where supplies for a planned branch in Cavite — their first in the south — will come from. Of course, it’s really the food that had patrons coming back, or even traveling to check out their new branches. They serve family favorites, from pizzas and pastas to burgers and fries, but there are also combo and rice meals, as well as a full chiller of cakes and a wide selection of sorbetes flavors. “I really wanted it to be a family-oriented restaurant,” said Benedict. And that family also includes still having baller friends around. A former Far Eastern University teammate, for instance, is his supplier for his takeout containers. Sometimes, Benedict still feels surprised how his once hole-in-the-wall venture grew amid all the personal adversity. “I’m happy where I am right now. I’m okay because the business is good,” he shared. “I am able to give a good life for my family, support my staff, and we’re able to give joy to our customers.” – Rappler.com",True,true,"How ex-PBA player Benedict Fernandez lost a battle, won the next chapter",https://www.rappler.com/sports/pba/former-player-benedict-fernandez-grumpy-joe-restaurant/,Rappler
"Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer: I want to share that I have observed a common factor with my last two relationships. One girlfriend “ANA” is the daughter of an angry man; the second “SUSAN” also didn’t have a good relationship with her family. Her father passed away two years before we met. Moving forward, I guess it’s important for me to filter out candidates who lack a good relationship with their family. I can still hear “SUSAN’s” sentiments echo and disturb my peace. Susan would be butthurt about the idea that I talk to multiple women, and yet at that time, I haven’t made any exclusive commitment with any of them. For example if i sent reels to Girl A and not Girl B, does Girl B have the right to be mad? I’m drawing analogies to a person applying for work. We don’t put all our eggs in one basket, i.e.interview, and lock on to only one potential employer right? We diversify and distribute our CVs to as many good companies where we see we could fit and then take it from there to get to know them better ‘di ba? Likewise, it’s not like companies cast and interview one, and only one, candidate to fill the role they’re hiring right? Even for an employer’s perspective conducting a final interview with their one and only candidate on their list, they don’t take offense if the applicant has other pending applications right? What do you think? – SAM Dear Sam, Thank you for your email. Let’s deal first with your notion that you should avoid women who don’t have good relationships with their families. While it is indeed sensible to filter who you should and shouldn’t date, this test seems too broad. After all, there are circumstances, e.g. alcohol or drug abuse, in which children might be wise to distance themselves from their parents, so it would be perverse to hold this against a prospective partner when they were simply acting in their own best interests. Having said that, it is prudent to take family circumstances into account when considering the suitability of a partner since children are Inevitably shaped by their family history. However, while some children are permanently scarred by their childhoods, others are resilient, perhaps by nature or, for example, through therapy, and rise above their travails. So perhaps your test should be applied with some finesse, taking the broader family situation into account. At the end of the day, family background history is only part of an appreciation of your partner’s emotional development. As for your views on commitment, it is important to realize that concepts like commitment have different meanings to different people. It is therefore helpful to ensure that you and your partner at least understand how the other interprets this if you are to avoid misunderstandings as the relationship develops. Conflicting views have a way of impeding the smooth course of what is the complex process of learning to interpret the reactions of another person on all levels: emotional, intellectual, physical, etc. Good communication is therefore key as a relationship evolves. In summary, rather than dissecting your partners’ backstories, look at how they have processed them. Avoid any excessive emphasis on psychological analysis which risks a purely intellectual analysis of a potential relationship and then concentrate on whether there are any prospects of emotional compatibility. Maintain open and transparent communication instead of sparring over definitions and semantics so that there is a fair chance that the two of you may actually be on the same page! Best wishes, JAF Baer Dear Sam, Thank you very much for your letter. I initially thought (silly me) that your question was so easy it was like shooting fish in a barrel. How wrong I was. Because what you wrote does make a lot of sense (thus easy). It is also true. There are many ways dysfunctional families wreak havoc on their daughters’ romantic relationships, but there are many which don’t. Because there is so much research on the topic you brought up, I am sharing only my perspective, based on my clinical experience. I promise, however, that if there are methodologically sound studies that lead to conclusions different from what I write, I will let you know. I feel I owe that to you. Why am I making such a big deal about this? Because everyone has their own opinion on how one’s childhood/one’s past affects one’s present life. Of course, opinions based on personal experience are valid — made even more so if your behaviors towards potential mates change because of the particular experiences you’ve had…which will result in their own behaviors changing as a result of your behavior towards them. If that is the case, it is most likely your hypothesis that women who grow up in dysfunctional families make terrible partners will be true not necessarily because of the kind of families they grew up in, but because of how you behave towards them when you found out. So, do women’s relationships with their families affect their relationships with potential partners? No doubt about it. However, the effect can be good or bad, or partly good and partly bad, depending on how that particular woman deals with her own situation. Thus, the sum of all these “parenting effects” PLUS her own agency, may make her a more “worthwhile partner” than not. She may actually succeed when she tells herself, no way will she become the sort of spouse her parents were, and no way will she inflict the same dysfunctionality on her own kids In her case, it just might be true, even if, more often than not, those most adamant about making sure they do not wind up like their parents turn out to be like them the most. I am glad, however, that you are trying to look beyond the more obvious reasons your last two relationships didn’t work out, rather than merely settling for the most obvious or most talked about reason. Finally (for this column, at least — as there is so much more to say about how childhood can affect your romantic relationships) perhaps a clearer way for you to judge whether your hypothesis is fair or not is to ask yourself how you would feel if she rejected you based on the kind of upbringing you had. It need not even be whether your family is dysfunctional or not. It could be a matter of money: Will she reject you because your family is well off and thus you are more likely to be entitled? Or might she reject you because you come from a lower socio-economic background and thus do not come from the right school, the right circles. You see how unfair it can be, right? Judging individuals based on things they cannot help, things they didn’t choose. And yet, AND yet, sometimes these things do matter. So I guess the best I can say is, in the final analysis, do not choose just one yardstick to make up your mind. Life is not that simple, neither are people. All the very best, MG Holmes – Rappler.com",True,true,[Two Pronged] Is it okay to speak to multiple women during the ‘talking stage’?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/two-pronged-talking-multiple-women/,Rappler
"Every Filipino loves a good story of triumph. We celebrate people who rise above hardship because it reminds us of our own struggles and our own hopes. It reassures us that no matter where we come from or what we face, we can still move forward. This is why the journey of a group of athletes from Cebu deserves attention. The Philippine Accessible Disability Services (PADS) Adaptive Dragon Boat Team recently competed in the Penang International Dragon Boat Regatta 2025, delivering a performance that reflected not only athletic excellence but also the quiet, determined resilience that defines so many Filipinos. The PADS Adaptive Dragon Boat Team is the living expression of a mission that empowers persons with disabilities (PWDs). Competing at the Penang International Dragon Boat Regatta 2025, the team delivered an extraordinary showing. They captured gold in the Dragon Boat Tug-of-War International Premier Open, earned silver in both the Junior U24 and Senior 400-meter races, and secured bronze finishes in the U24 Premier Open and Senior 250-meter small boat categories. Their success in Penang reflects years of discipline, belief, and the conviction that ability flourishes when people are treated with fairness and respect. The team is composed of persons with disabilities who have been uplifted through education, community engagement, capacity building, and inclusive advocacy. They have grown within an environment that strengthens human rights awareness, promotes Filipino Sign Language, encourages civic participation, and provides inclusive spaces for rehabilitation and adaptive sports. In every training session, every community activity, and every race they join, the team affirms a single principle: dignity and opportunity belong to every person. Their achievement offers lessons far beyond sport. Watching athletes who have faced significant physical and social barriers paddle with such unity challenges us to reconsider the limitations we place on others and even on ourselves. Their journey shows that resilience thrives in every corner of the Philippines, yet access to opportunity does not. Many Filipinos have extraordinary potential, but potential only becomes progress when society builds pathways where individuals can succeed. The triumph of the PADS team is a powerful reminder of what becomes possible when encouragement, opportunity, and community intersect. This understanding is important for the business sector. Companies are rooted in the communities that sustain them. Their growth and stability depend on the dignity, inclusiveness, and wellbeing of the people around them. When groups like the PADS Adaptive Dragon Boat Team advocate for accessibility, representation, and equal rights, they strengthen the foundations on which businesses thrive. A nation where persons with disabilities can learn, communicate, participate, and excel becomes more cohesive and more capable. Supporting organizations that uplift others is not simply a charitable gesture. It is an acknowledgment that genuine progress is shared progress and that the success of any enterprise is intertwined with the wellbeing of the society it serves. This is the same belief that guides the support extended by Immuni Global Incorporated to initiatives rooted in dignity and inclusion. Through ImmuniPlus, which serves as the official Recovery Partner of the PADS Adaptive Dragon Boat Team, this commitment is expressed through practical support that helps athletes sustain their performance, endurance, and wellbeing. The partnership reflects a conviction that when an organization dedicates itself to empowering others, the responsibility of business is to help reinforce that effort in ways that are respectful, meaningful, and aligned with the greater good. Standing with those who stand up for others ensures that stories like the PADS team’s victory continue to unfold. It guarantees that persons with disabilities are not left to navigate their challenges alone. It gives their achievements the strength to inspire others still waiting for recognition and opportunity. Leadership is not measured solely by strategy or performance. It is also measured by the values we uphold and the communities we choose to support. When businesses align themselves with movements that champion inclusion, they help build a culture where no individual is underestimated or excluded. The path toward a disability-inclusive Philippines continues to evolve, but the PADS Adaptive Dragon Boat Team has shown what is possible when compassion is paired with structure and when opportunity is extended to those who need it most. Their athletes demonstrate that limitations can be overcome when communities choose to invest in people rather than overlook them. Their work offers a vision of a nation where every Filipino, regardless of physical condition, is afforded the dignity and opportunity to participate fully in society. When we uplift one Filipino, we strengthen the communities around us. When we remove barriers, we allow hidden potential to emerge. And when businesses stand with those who stand up for others, we help shape a future where stories of inclusion and empowerment become not the exception, but the expectation. The victories of the PADS Adaptive Dragon Boat Team in Penang may not have dominated the national conversation, but their message is profound. They reflect the enduring strength of the Filipino spirit and remind us of the power we hold when we choose to lift one another. – Rappler.com Ralph Ray Dacay Chua is the chairman of the board and president of Immuni Global Incorporated.

"Katrin Muller was walking with her boyfriend when she saw a Sarao jeepney pass by. It wasn’t common to see a jeepney in Germany in the early 1970s, so she tried to run after it. It was the next day that she saw the jeepney again. The driver was wearing a bowl-cut hairdo, the kind you would see among the old Bontoc warriors, who cut their hair with an ax and a coconut shell as a guide. The driver must have a way with words because, after meeting him, Katrin dumped her boyfriend and fell in love with the Filipino. The Filipino is Kidlat Tahimik, then still known as Eric de Guia, a former banker who was then finishing his first film, Mababangong Bangungot. That movie would become one of the greatest unknown films in the World, one that remains influential to this day. The love life of Katrin and Eric would also last the test of time. They would have three sons, all artists in their own way: Kidlat, Kawayan, and Kabunyan. When the 5Ks returned to Baguio after the snap elections in 1985, they also helped form the Baguio Arts Group, which not only shook up Baguio’s creative scene but also the whole country. Katrin acted in Kidlat’s films, including Turumba, Bakit Nasa Gitna ang Yellow, and Balikbayan #1: Memories of Overdevelopment, which was started in the 1980s but was finished in 2010. She also did performance art, usually with Shant Verdun, and dabbled in stained glass. In recent years, she had been creating those Daliesque dolls and figures made of junk and trinkets. However, the most significant contribution of Dr. Katrin Muller-De Guia was her book, Kapwa: The Self in Other — Worldviews and Lifestyles of Filipino Culture-Bearers, which was published 20 years ago. I had the privilege of editing that book before it was submitted to Anvil Publishing. It was a wonderful three months in Manigo Street, having coffee consultations with her. She will be remembered for exploring the Filipino soul and consciousness in art and beyond. Her lifework would henceforth be known for plumbing kapwa, which she defined as the Filipino core value of shared identity and interconnectedness, not merely as an abstract concept, but as a living philosophy that could heal both individuals and nations. It has been two decades since Anvil published Kapwa, the Self in Other: Worldviews and Lifestyles of Filipino Culture-Bearers. This German hippie from Munich was one of the last students of Dr. Virgilio Enriquez, the father of Sikolohiyang Pilipino, at the University of the Philippines before Enriquez migrated to California. Katrin remembered her conversations with Enriquez about kapwa, a distinct Filipino concept. To live kapwa is to remember that “the self in other” is not metaphorical; it is existential. In kapwa, the boundaries between “I” and “you” dissolve. What remains is a recognition of a shared essence, akin to the Rastafarian concept of “I and I,” where the divine spark resides equally in all beings. For Katrin, this was not an idea to be merely studied; it was a concept to be explored. It was a way of being to be lived, tested, and embodied. Her book, which became a finalist for the National Book Awards, discussed kapwa in the lives and works of Baguio artists Santi Bose, Roberto Villanueva, Rene Aquitania, and Kidlat, as well as New York-based documentarian Angel Shaw, Boracay artist Perry Argel, and film director Kanakan Balintagos. The decolonizing work of Sikolohiyang Pilipino, which began with Dr. Enriquez, found in Katrin a worthy inheritor and transformer. Her contribution was not just to Filipino psychology, but to world philosophy — demonstrating that indigenous concepts like kapwa are not relics, but remedies for the alienation of modern life. She reminded us that decolonization is not only about recovering what was lost, but about re-rooting our consciousness in the living soil of relational being. She did not just write about the subjects; she lived and participated with them. She walked with them barefoot through mountains, shores, and rivers, lived among them, and slept under the same stars. Her ethnography was not extractive; it was relational, grounded in pakikiramdam, the intuitive knowing through feeling. The book was reprinted twice, yet it has become one of the most sought-after books. Its price in online shops has increased 10 times its original price, driven primarily by demand from Fil-Am students who have found their source of creative indigeneity in the book. This year, Kawayan de Guia was able to get a PDF copy of the book. They decided to print a third edition by themselves with a new introduction and a few revisions. It was a race against time to have it for the recent Frankfurt Book Fair. Katrin had been very sick. She contracted long COVID and was unable to shake it off. In 2024, she went home to say goodbye to her family, and the book also served as a means for her to reconnect with her homeland. It was while editing the new version that I read of Katrin’s jeepney love story. I can’t help but write “Basta Jeepney Driver, Sweet Lover” as the subtitle. Actually, there is another book that we are also trying to finish. It should have been the sequel to Kapwa. It will be about the Kapwa and the World. After publishing the first Kapwa book, Dr. Katrin de Guia organized two international Kapwa conferences in Baguio. From the conferences, she was able to hone in on three to five papers read by other kindred writers. At first, Katrin wanted to write a personal introduce to the essays. But, as her time was running out, she thought of expounding on the kapwa in the cosmos. Kapwa, the Self in All, was her tantalizing specter. Where her first book explored the self-in-other among humans, the next would have expanded this circle of belonging to include the more-than-human World: plants, animals, rivers, and mountains. “We forget that we are not the only ones on this planet,” she said. In that statement lies both an ecological ethic and a spiritual imperative — one urgently needed in our time of climate crisis and existential disconnection. When the second book could not be sent to Frankfurt, she gave her husband permission to bring the Kapwa to the book fair. It was while Kidlat was on his way that Katrin died in her house in Tuding. She was 75. It was on the midnight of October 12, surrounded by her two remaining sons, Kawayan and Kabunyan, and her faithful dog, Max. She was cremated soon after. Her wake happened on October 24 to 25 at Ili Likha. The public announcement had her in Germany, beside the jeepney she had run after that. “Ang Pinoy jeepney journey ni Katrin, isang KAPWA nating pasahero dito sa Baguio since 1980 ay kompleto na,” it said.

"Tax is the lifeblood of government, but when leakages and evasion drain the system, it is ordinary Filipinos who suffer. Despite economic growth averaging 5–6% in recent years, the Philippines’ tax-to-GDP ratio stood at 14.1% in 2023. This remains significantly below the OECD average of 34% and lags behind the Asia-Pacific region’s average of 19.5%. In fact, at 14.1%, the Philippines’ tax effort is lower than several regional neighbors, including Thailand (which reports figures around 15–17% depending on the methodology) and the average for the Asia-Pacific region. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has made progress through campaigns like RATE (Run After Tax Evaders) and RAFT (Run After Fake Transactions). But if we are serious about fighting corruption, closing loopholes, and financing sustainable development, we need sector-based enforcement that matches our GDP profile and industry risks. Alongside RATE and RAFT, the government must also look at the special economic zones. Under the CREATE MORE Act, the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) plays a critical role as the gatekeeper of tax incentives, ensuring that income tax holidays (ITH), the 5% special corporate income tax, VAT zero-rating, and more are granted only to compliant firms. Stronger coordination between PEZA and BIR can prevent leakages such as misdeclared exports or abuse of VAT exemptions, while still protecting the country’s competitiveness in attracting investors. In this way, incentives serve their purpose of fueling genuine economic activity instead of becoming grey areas for tax avoidance. Other countries show us what’s possible. Brazil closed its VAT gaps through the use of electronic invoicing. Estonia integrates tax, social security, and banking data into one digital identity system. South Korea links government procurement directly to tax reporting, reducing corruption. The Philippines doesn’t need higher tax rates; it requires smarter enforcement. When money is lost due to corruption or tax evasion, every peso represents a missed opportunity for classrooms, hospitals, and climate resilience initiatives. If the goal is a Philippines free from corruption, climate change, and poverty, the necessary starting point is a functional tax system that ensures everyone contributes their fair share. – Rappler.com Mon Abrea, CPA, MBA, MPA, is the founder and Chief Tax Advisor of the Asian Consulting Group (ACG), the Philippines’ pioneering tax advisory firm recognized internationally for cross-border taxation and investment.

"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines presented eight newly signed Petroleum Service Contracts (PSC) on Wednesday, October 8. The contracts, signed in a ceremony in Malacañang, “will pave the way for explorations in Palawan, Sulu, Cagayan, Cebu, and Central Luzon, [and opens] new opportunities for our energy sector,” President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said in a speech. Wednesday’s ceremony in Malacañang Palace featured the largest batch of PSCs awarded at once in Philippine history, according to the Presidential Communications Office. According to a release from Malacañang, the eight contracts amount to over $200 million or around P11.6 billion in investments. The newly signed service contracts are the following, according to a release from the energy department: The signing of the PSCs mean the service contractors can “now commence their respective work programs, which will include geological and geophysical studies, seismic surveys, and drilling activities as appropriate,” said the energy department. The contractors are also expected to “fund and undertake educational scholarships, capacity building, and community development programs even during the early exploration phase.” Marcos, in his speech, noted that the Philippines imported over 340,000 barrels of liquid fuel in 2024, or over 99.68% of the country’s petroleum supply. The rest of the Philippines’ needs — a measly 0.32% or just over 1,000 barrels — were produced domestically. The country also imported some 46.15% of its natural gas needs in 2024, with the rest sourced from the dwindling Malampaya reserve. “That is why today’s presentation of eight service contracts is a deliberate step towards securing our energy future,” said Marcos. – Rappler.com",True,true,"PH awards energy service contracts in BARMM, Cagayan, Central Luzon, Cebu, Palawan",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/petroleum-service-contracts-signed-october-2025/,Rappler
"STOCKHOLM, Sweden – Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt won the 2025 Nobel economics prize for their work on how innovation and the forces of “creative destruction” can drive economic growth and lift living standards across the globe. Their research explains how technology gives rise to new products and production methods which replace old ones, resulting in a better standard of living, health, and quality of life. “Over the last two centuries, for the first time in history, the world has seen sustained economic growth. This has lifted vast numbers of people out of poverty and laid the foundation of our prosperity,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said in a statement. The laureates have also shown that such progress cannot be taken for granted, the Academy said, while two of the prize winners highlighted that US President Donald Trump’s trade policies would impinge on growth. “Economic stagnation, not growth, has been the norm for most of human history. Their work shows that we must be aware of, and counteract, threats to continued growth,” the Academy said. While most economists view economic growth as a driver of prosperity, there are some who do not see it as an unalloyed good. The 2024 economics prize was won by Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson for work on inequality and Johnson in particular has pointed to how the benefits of technological innovation can be skewed toward powerful elites. There is also a fierce debate about what level of growth is sustainable in light of man-made climate change and environmental degradation. The prestigious award, formally known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, is the final prize to be given out this year and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2 million). Mokyr, a professor at Northwestern University in the United States, was awarded half the prize. Aghion, a professor at the College de France and INSEAD in Paris and at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and Howitt, a professor at Brown University in the United States, shared the other half. The award comes at a potential inflection point for the global economy with many expecting artificial intelligence to spark a new growth spurt. It also highlights the strategic risks for Europe of falling further behind the United States and China on technologies of the future as well as the potential costs of barriers to global trade. Speaking by phone at the press conference, Aghion said de-globalization and tariff barriers were “obstacles to growth,” adding that the bigger the market, the more possibilities to exchange ideas, transfer technologies, and for healthy competition. “Anything that gets in the way of openness is an obstacle to growth. So I see there kind of dark clouds currently accumulating, pushing for barriers to trade and openness,” he said. Aghion called on Europe to learn from the US and China, which he said have found ways to reconcile competition and industrial policy. “In Europe, in the name of competition policy, we became very anti any form of industrial policy. I think we need to evolve on that and find ways to reconcile industrial policy in areas like defense, climate, AI, biotech,” he said. Howitt, who said he had been “absolutely stunned” by the award, was also critical of President Trump’s trade policies. “It’s pretty clear that these are going to discourage innovation by reducing what we call the scale effect,” he told Reuters. “Starting a tariff war just reduces the size of the market for everybody.” He said that trying to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US could perhaps make some political sense but was not good economic policy. “We’re good at designing running shoes, but it’s best for us to leave others to make them,” he said. The awards for medicine, physics, chemistry, peace, and literature were announced last week. Those prizes were established in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been handed out since 1901, with a few interruptions mostly due to the world wars. The economics prize was established much later, being given out first in 1969 when it was won by Norway’s Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen from the Netherlands for work in dynamic economic modeling. Tinbergen’s brother Nikolaas also won a prize, taking home Medicine in 1973. While few economists are household names, relatively well-known winners include former US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, and Paul Krugman and Milton Friedman. – Rappler.com $1 = 9.5112 Swedish crowns",True,true,"Trio win Nobel economics prize for work on innovation, growth, and ‘creative destruction’",https://www.rappler.com/business/winners-nobel-prize-economic-sciences-2025/,Rappler
"The Philippine Botanical Art Society (PhilBAS) and Philippine Fauna Art Society (PhilFAS) celebrate their sixth anniversary this year, around the beginning of the -ber months. All the more, at this time, artist members organize a flurry of exhibits. That, on top of several collaborations with institutions, while making their mark in championing native wildlife conservation. It wasn’t always like that. The art organizations’ journey wasn’t linear — mirroring that of their founder, Willa Freah Famoso Tac-an, or more simply, Bing Famoso. Bing’s life has many interesting stories. One of them begins in a small room at the National Museum of Natural History, given to Famoso by the Botany and National Herbarium Division as her workshop. She had already founded the organizations and was assigned to illustrate a plant species for a scientific journal. It wasn’t the first time for Bing. She had painted several flora species for exhibits before. She’d be an expert. Still, forester Dany Tandang, researcher at the museum, had something to say about her work. She was getting ahead of herself, Tandang told her. There was a curve on a leaf that didn’t go the right way. She already had a preconceived object in her head, that’s why, Tandang said. “I was trained by Dr. Dany Tandang to keep your eye focused on the details, na ‘wag mong i-se-stray ‘yong eyes mo (to not let my eyes stray),” Bing said. A little mistake, say, a slight difference in color, or a deviation in the pattern, will portray a different species entirely. “Feeling ko ‘di ako artist, ‘yong to the point na hindi artsy,” Bing said about her work. (I don’t feel like an artist, not in that artsy kind of way.) At its core, botanical and fauna art is a scientist’s work. It requires careful observation and precision, contrary to the openness and freedom of the brush strokes in other art forms. But for Bing, like an eagle locking onto its mark, this is just another challenge she’s ready to take. When Bing began PhilBAS and PhilFAS, she meant the organizations to be inclusive — no certain skill required to become a member. It’s a rarity in the art community, where groups tend to be elite. That’s why members range from nine-year-olds to housewives, lawyers, doctors, and teachers. Students and those with science backgrounds join too. The two societies have over 100 members combined as of this writing. Botanical and fauna art wasn’t widely practiced before, not unless one was a botanist or a wildlife biologist — and even then, it was mostly for journal publications, not art exhibits. “As artists, ‘di pa tayo talaga bihasa (we’re not really skilled yet). So we grow together as botanical artists,” Bing said. This is exactly what she envisioned. At the beginning, she only wanted to join a local flora art group to learn about native species, but found none. As in most of her life stories, problems like that don’t stop her. How the art organizations began is something Bing laughs about. In April 2018, she decided to go to the National Museum of Natural History — alone — to pitch her big idea of a flora artist organization in the Philippines. She didn’t know anyone at the museum. She was a 44-year-old housewife who never had an eight-to-five job before. She was nonetheless led to the right office by talking her way past the strict security. She convinced the security guard she knew some “doctor” from the botany division. Ah she’s talking about Dr. Edwin Tadiosa, the security guard said. And Bing replied, yes, that’s the one. Despite the surprise, she was accommodated by Tadiosa and John Rey Callado, both botanists and museum researchers. That was also when she first met Tandang. She wanted to revive the botanical art form, Bing told them. Among the last known records of Philippine botanical art is Flora de Filipinas, a 19th-century set of books by Augustinian botanist Manuel Blanco, to which 17 Filipinos contributed. The species’ names have long since changed, rendering the work obsolete. Bing learned about that tidbit when she went down a rabbit hole into botanical art in the Philippines. Her deep dive began in 2016 when she saw cherry blossoms planted in Benguet and heard plans for a local cherry blossom festival. Having lived in Korea for six years (her husband was based there), she knew the trees were native there, not in the Philippines. The thought saddened her — she wondered what native flowers the Philippines had that were as beautiful. Her search revealed wonders like the tayabak or the jade vine, the suwiyasuy or the Benguet lily, and many more. “For the first time in my life, I saw these beautiful species,” she said. After seeing that the Philippines had thousands of its own, Bing couldn’t take seeing the cherry blossoms celebrated in Benguet. “Nag-rebolusyon ‘yong aking puso (My heart was in revolt),” she said. In 2017, she began painting Philippine endemic flowers for her exhibits, deviating from her favorite subject, the mother and child. “Hindi ako sikat na artist, or hindi rin ako marunong pa dahil kaka-start ko lang. But it made me inspired na mag-exhibit ako just so makita ng mga tao ‘yong mga endemic flora.” (I’m not a well-known artist, and I was still new to this. But it inspired me to mount an exhibit so people could see the endemic flora.) To Bing, Philippine wildlife conservation is a tall order. There are over 50,000 flora and fauna species in the Philippines, around half of which are endemic, according to the Philippine Clearing House Mechanism. The Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has listed as threatened at least 1,106 fauna species as of 2019 and 984 flora species as of 2017. “How can botanists and environmentalists do that alone?” she asked. Then she realized she couldn’t either. “If by myself I paint these, baka patay na ‘ko, ‘di ko pa sila na-pe-paint lahat (I’d be dead before I finished them all). [That’s why I built the societies].” Bing believes art can spark awareness. “If they will see a story on the canvas…it will appeal to their emotions, to their senses,” she said. Those emotions can inspire curiosity and action for conservation. Botanist Fernando Aurige once gave his book on Philippine hoya species to Bing with a note, “Please continue on contributing to science your artworks.” “I love her work,” wildlife biologist Leticia Afuang said during Bing’s solo exhibit in May 2025. “I respect everything that she is doing. And I will always support her.” Bing worked hard to earn the trust of scientists. In 2018, when Bing pitched her idea to the museum botanists, the organizations weren’t established right away. Great idea, the botanists told her, but come back another time. They were busy with museum renovations. And Bing kept coming back. On September 4, 2019, they finally granted her wish — PhilBAS was established, with Tandang, Tadiosa, and Callado as her co-founders. Soon after, Bing founded PhilFAS to include wildlife. Bing’s identity as an artist has always been intertwined with her roles as a housewife and a mother. Right after graduating from university in 1995, she married and focused on family. In 2013, watching her eldest child leave for college gave her deep separation anxiety — yet it was also the year she discovered painting. Seeing oil paintings in her daughter’s dorm room, she admitted, “Nainggit ako doon sa anak ko (I envied my daughter).” Her degree in Philippine arts at the University of the Philippines Manila, trained her in arts management — not to be an artist. So three years later, at 42, she began learning to paint with her daughter’s high school teacher as her tutor. On the contrary, organizing events came naturally to her, thanks to her sorority training and university connections. So everything was going well — until in 2022, when she found out she had lupus, an incurable autoimmune disease. Projects of the organizations were ongoing at the time, but Bing fell into depression and withdrew for two years. Her co-founders were so supportive of her in 2019 that, they entrusted all operations to her alone. It did well at the beginning; projects were completed swiftly without the bureaucracy. But operations stopped when Bing disappeared. “Nawala na lang nang parang bula (It just vanished into thin air),” she said. Bing thought it was her illness that brought her depression. But it was also her youngest child who left for the United States in 2020 to study. This left her and her husband alone at home, giving her debilitating separation anxiety. “‘Yon lang din ang [naging] buhay ko (That was the only life I knew),” she said about being a mother. It was in 2024 when Bing came to terms with the big changes in her life. “I’m prepared for my death, I’m prepared for my future, for my funeral, for my wake,” she said. When it comes to her kids, she added, “Ngayon, kapag nag-pe-paint ako, ‘di ko sila naaalala (Now, when I paint, I forget about them for a while).” Both art organizations were revived in 2024, and projects once again filled her days. Among those she’s proudest of is PhilBAS’ participation in Botanical Art Worldwide (BAW). Through this event, the public can view bright illustrations of the Philippines’ native flora species inside Gallery XII of the National Museum of Natural History. The exhibit was launched on August 29, 2025, and runs until May 18, 2026. The organizations also have collaborations with the DENR-BMB, the Department of Education, the Department of Foreign Affairs, and other agencies that the public should watch out for. In November 2025, she’ll be in Oslo, Norway, for an exhibit with the Philippine embassy in Norway. Bing, at 51, has a long list of goals she’s working on to achieve. In some of her daydreams, she’s a teacher of a newly-established botanical art course at a university. In others, she’s donated a Philippine eagle painting to all Philippine embassies across the globe. In her wildest imaginations, she’s among the founders of an international fauna art society. Those are too big ambitions she doesn’t need in her life, her colleagues would tell her. “Magpahinga ka naman (Get some rest too),” they’d say. “No,” Bing said she’d respond in Filipino. “That way we’re just letting time slip away.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Flora and fauna artist Bing Famoso’s brush keeps Philippine nature alive,https://www.rappler.com/environment/nature/profile-flora-fauna-artist-bing-famoso/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Robert Coyiuto Jr. has stepped down as vice chairman and director of Synergy Grid & Development Philippines (SGP), which owns 40.2% of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP). The latter manages the state-owned power grid. During SGP’s annual stockholders meeting on Thursday, October 16, Coyiuto was not elected as a director for the 2025 to 2026 period after 13 years in SGP’s leadership. Coyiuto and Henry Sy Jr. each own 38.94% of SGP, according to the company’s latest list of top 100 stockholders. Sy was reelected as chairman of SGP’s board, but Coyiuto is no longer listed as vice chair and director. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Friday, October 17, SGP clarified that Coyiuto remains a shareholder of the company, and that the new directors were nominated by current shareholders. Coyiuto’s seat went to SGP’s treasurer and chief finance officer Justice Lady P. Soriano. She was appointed to the post in 2021 following the resignation of treasurer and director Dave Nhowel Asejo to pursue other engagements. Another newcomer to SGP’s board is independent director Daniel Ibasco. He is the owner and co-founder of investment banking boutique Fortman Cline Capital Markets, and previously served as managing director of American investment banking firm Bear Sterns. Ibasco replaced Saturnino Juan as independent director after the latter’s appointment as Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) chair. Coyiuto’s exit from SGP’s leadership has rekindled talks that the Maharlika Investment Corporation (MIC), which runs the Philippines’ first sovereign wealth fund called Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF), finalized a deal to secure 20% of the grid operator. SGP clarified that negotiations with MIC are still ongoing, as they are still discussing detailed terms of the deal. “Given the scale and strategic nature of the investment, extensive due diligence and coordination among parties in SGP are required. Discussions also continue on the investment structure and governance arrangements to ensure alignment with shareholder and regulatory expectations,” the company wrote. MIC first bought a 20% slice of SGP back in January for P19.7 billion in preferred shares as its maiden investment, giving the government two board seats. MIC President Rafael Consing Jr. previously said the investment aims to lower electricity prices and give the government a bird’s eye view of how the NGCP is run. SGP’s share prices plunged 5.06% on Friday trade to P15.38 apiece following the news. – Rappler.com",True,true,Tycoon Robert Coyiuto Jr. exits SGP board after 13 years,https://www.rappler.com/business/robert-coyiuto-jr-exits-director-vice-chair-sgp/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) told senators on Thursday, October 2, that the Philippines must first fix its digitalization problems before it can realistically move the national budget onto a blockchain. During a Senate committee on science and technology hearing on the proposed Blockchain the National Budget Act (SB No. 1330), DICT Secretary Henry Aguda said the country already has the necessary laws to digitalize government processes. “We don’t need a new law for digitalization,” Aguda said. “The problem is not technology — it’s execution and implementation.” The hearing, presided over by the bill’s author Senator Bam Aquino, gathered officials from the DICT, Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and several private sector groups, including digital signature provider Twala, blockchain-as-a-service provider BayaniChain, and the Blockchain Council of the Philippines. The session explored how blockchain could be used to make the national budget more transparent and accountable. The bill, filed in September 2025, has gotten a warm reception among the public but has also earned critics, voicing concerns on the integrity of data coming in, and urging the exploration of alternative digital record-keeping systems that may be more cost effective. Before digitalization, some critics online pointed out harsh realities for the country’s digital landscape, namely unaddressed issues in stable internet connectivity, cybersecurity, and data sovereignty. Some, like former solicitor general Florin Hilbay, also decried on Facebook the need for blockchain, He proposed other measures to restore trust in the budget process, including a “National Budget in Action” website with access to all documents, blockchain-like parallel websites by NGOs and organizations with said documents as redundancy, and a reward system for journalists and “internet sleuths” for discovering anomalies. Aguda said the legal framework for digitalization is already in place through the E-Governance Act (Republic Act 12254), Electronic Commerce Act (Republic Act 8792), and the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act or Anti-Red Tape Act (Republic Act 11032). Under the E-Governance Act, all agencies are required to adopt interoperable digital systems and participate in a unified government information network led by the DICT. The E-Commerce Act gives legal recognition to electronic documents and digital signatures, while the Anti-Red Tape Act directs agencies to automate and streamline their processes. Despite these laws, Aguda said implementation remains slow. “In the ICT, six months in, I’ve been looking for all the documents, paper or electronic. And this is already the ICT. So, it took us six months just to upload all of the transactions related to Free Wi-Fi,” he said. “The hardest work is not technology — it’s the bureaucracy of getting the information.” He added that gathering data takes months because “you have to go down several levels before somebody can say, ‘ito na yung file.’” “Technology is not the problem. It’s going to be getting the information, navigating the process, and moving the people to comply,” he said. Third Bagro, co-founder and general counsel of the local startup Twala, warned that blockchain cannot fix flawed or inaccurate data, echoing the garbage-in-garbage-out concerns that some observers have pointed out. “Blockchain is a powerful tool because it locks in records. Once written, they can’t be tampered with and they stay there forever. But here’s the catch — blockchain cannot guarantee that the data being recorded is accurate in the first place. If the information is wrong before it’s entered, blockchain will preserve it, but it will also preserve the error,” Bagro said. Bagro said agencies still rely heavily on manual systems. “Too often agencies use expensive software but at the end you still print, sign, and pass papers around and then scan them to be digitalized. We need digital signatures to secure these documents, make them tamper-proof, auditable, and traceable,” he added. “At this stage, accuracy and validity are critical. That’s where other technologies and safeguards come in. Remember, the blockchain itself only records cryptographic proofs. The actual documents and evidence may remain off-chain but must be secured. Once processes are digital and data is validated, then and only then can we record every transaction on the blockchain,” Bagro said. Bagro cautioned that blockchain is not the cure. “Bringing the national budget onto the blockchain won’t end corruption by itself. Blockchain is only a tool, but it is a step towards stronger accountability and greater transparency,” he said. “It must come with enabling reforms, fully digital processes, interconnected institutions, and for the bad actors, swift and certain punishment.” Aguda agreed, saying the technology’s success depends on the government’s willingness to fully commit to digitalization. He called blockchain “the right timing and the right tool,” but only if the foundation of digital governance is in place. “If the budget is digital, everything else will follow,” he said. “Once the mother document is interoperable and on the blockchain, agencies that aren’t following will be forced to catch up.” Aquino said the bill will likely follow a phased implementation. “Phase 1 could simply be publishing, closer to the full disclosure bill that we’ve seen in the past. Phase 2 could be maybe identifying key agencies with the biggest procurement and what layers they need to put on the blockchain. And then maybe phase three could be the other aspects and other agencies. Obviously, we can identify the agencies with the biggest budgets like DPWH (Department of Public Works and Highways), DOH (Deparment of Health), DepEd (Department of Education),” the senator said. “Every step toward transparency is a step toward good governance,” Aquino said. “We’re not looking for perfection, we’re looking for something we can do immediately.” BayaniChain Ventures co-founder Gelo Wong added that blockchain could make budget data accessible to ordinary citizens. “For every Filipino, it means participation,” he said. “Budget data will be directly accessible on a smartphone, and 70% of Filipinos already have a smartphone. Citizens can audit anytime, anywhere.” As the Senate prepares its technical working group to refine the bill, lawmakers and agencies appeared aligned on one point: blockchain could strengthen transparency, but the Philippines must first complete the difficult groundwork, and long-delayed efforts of digitalizing its bureaucracy. – Rappler.com Editor’s note: Third Bagro was incorrectly identified as CEO of Twala.

"MANILA, Philippines – Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC) is creating a standalone international company in preparation for a possible listing on a United States securities exchange by 2027, the fastfood giant announced on Tuesday, January 6. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), JFC said its international operations and business will be separated from its Philippine counterpart through the establishment of Jollibee Foods Corporation International (JFCI). This new firm will encapsulate all operations and businesses outside of the Philippines. JFC’s Philippine operations, meanwhile, will remain listed on the local bourse. The company explained that the spinoff will allow both entities to sharpen their strategic focus. “Built on a capital-light model with significant whitespace for expansion, it is positioned to operate in markets that support companies pursuing international scale, innovation, and long-term global growth,” the fastfood giant owned by Tony Tan Caktiong said. JFC added that it is already working on establishing the structure, process, and timing for the separation of the two business units and JFCI’s potential international listing. This may include any restructuring and asset transfers. Jollibee Group’s global president and chief executive officer Ernesto Tanmantiong said the spin-off and its potential US listing will demonstrate the firm’s strength on the global change. “As a proudly homegrown Philippine company, we carry our heritage and express our national pride into this next chapter of our journey. Our move toward an international listing demonstrates the strength of the Jollibee Group, a company with Filipino roots competing on the world stage,” he wrote in a statement. According to Rappler’s stock market analyst Den Somera, the spin-off will unlock values for JFC that the Philippine market cannot due to its current limitations. However, it remains unclear how the assets will be split between the two firms. Nonetheless, he said “the plan is beneficial to JFC price in the short term.” Unicapital equity research analyst Jeri Alfonso likened JFC’s spinoff to San Miguel Brewery’s (SMB) split from the main San Miguel Corporation (SMC) conglomerate in 2007. With the split, SMB gave investors the option to put their money in San Miguel’s brewery business, and provide the firm with more focused management. “After the deal, JFC on the PSE will be a pure domestic play, making it more comparable to local peers like Max’s Group (MAXS) and Shakey’s (PIZZA),” Alfonso told Rappler in a Viber message. While JFC’s share price is expected to drop due to the split, Alfonso believes the price will eventually adjust accordingly to fairly compensate existing investors. “In addition to this, bear in mind JFC shareholders will get JFCI shares as a property dividend,” she pointed out. According to JFC’s annual report, its international business units include the following: Meanwhile, its Philippine business units include Jollibee Philippines, Mang Inasal, Greenwich, and Red Ribbon. It also includes its foreign franchised brands such as Burger King, Panda Express, Yoshinoya, and Tiong Bahru Bakery. JFC posted a net income of just over P9 billion in the first nine months of 2025, with system-wide sales (SWS) of the Philippine business growing 5.5% in the third quarter. Its international business’ SWS also jumped 32.4% in the January-September 2025 period thanks to Compose Coffee and the strong performance of Jollibee’s international markets. During the first nine months of 2025, Compose Coffee’s SWS surged 540.9% and CBTL’s revenues also grew 13.9%. Milksha, which JFC acquired in 2025, saw its SWS grow 5.9%, while Tim Ho Wan‘s system-wide sales contracted by 20.2%. JFC share prices surged 14.5% to P210 apiece on Monday trade. – Rappler.com",True,true,What’s the impact of Jollibee’s planned spinoff and US listing of its int’l business?,https://www.rappler.com/business/jollibee-foods-corporation-spin-off-international-us-listing/,Rappler
"Imagine we have to pay the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines or NGCP for projects proposed but we don’t get a rebate of payments for projects not completed. We are also expected to be grateful for lower-rate adjustments like what was announced recently but never given the chance to be heard about our objections against higher transmission charges resulting from grand investment plans that look more like a strategy of increasing the sheer amount of corporate profits limited by the income cap it is mandated to earn. NGCP also continues to disappoint for results that are far from the claimed benefits envisioned by the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 or EPIRA: over the years since it took over operation of the national power grid in 2009, NGCP has had more excuses than results to show in actually responding to the consuming public’s continuing complaints over power outages and low power supply. But what horribly stands out at the moment is the fragile situation of the country’s power grid against potential manipulation and sabotage from the outside by a foreign force — especially to one the Philippines has existing territorial and geopolitical disputes. This is not a remote possibility with the increasing tensions we have with China in the West Philippine Sea. Like what China has been doing to us all along, another deliberate harassment occurred last October 12: a Chinese coastguard vessel identified as CCG 21559 rammed our BRP Datu Pagbuaya’s stern while near Pag-asa island helping our fisherfolks. PCG and BFAR Stand Firm Against Chinese Bullying and Aggressive Actions in Pag-asaThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) have reaffirmed their strong commitment to protecting Filipino fishermen in the Kalayaan Island Group,… pic.twitter.com/okA55L9oWs Not to mention also the countless harassments China has launched against us since it treacherously stole Bajo de Masinloc or Scarborough Reef in 2012, this latest wanton act of impunity is not just simply a figment of the mind but as a stark reminder and reality that our national security has always been in constant danger of being compromised — paradoxically — by NGCP’s partner, China: This is the national security issue they don’t want us to talk about. NGCP maintains that its operation complies with our domestic ownership laws. In reality, a Chinese state-linked entity is holding significant control over the country’s electrical heart: NGCP has been relying heavily on Chinese technology in the operation of the grid. It is using the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system supplied by the NARI Group Corporation, a Chinese IT infrastructure provider. Worse, the government has limited oversight powers over the facilities. The National Transmission Corporation or TransCo is the owner of the grid infrastructure while NGCP is only the appointed “house caretaker” or “taong bahay” in our local dialect. Yet, the TransCo is barred from inspecting NGCP’s operations. How on earth could this be? How can a house caretaker have more say over the owner of the house? This situation certainly poses a clear and present danger to Philippine sovereignty and energy security. Our power grid is not merely a piece of economic infrastructure. It is the central nervous system of the country. Its safety and stability are synonymous with economic functionality, public safety, and, ultimately, national security. NGCP’s ownership structure includes a 40% stake held by the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) — a China state-owned enterprise. And believe it or not, out of its 14 board members, which include four Chinese directors, NGCP’s board is chaired by a Chinese representative despite China’s minority position. This surely creates a profound and unacceptable vulnerability. SGCC is not a conventional private investor. It is an extension of a foreign government, bound by its domestic laws to serve the interests of that state, which includes intelligence gathering and compliance with its strategic directives. The Philippine grid has been using the Chinese-made SCADA systems and other specialized hardware. If control or even deep technical access to these systems is shared or can be leveraged by the minority partner, the physical grid becomes a geopolitical weapon. A targeted cyber-attack or pre-programmed vulnerability could lead to a systemic, nationwide blackout during a moment of great tension as in a hotly contested presidential election, a military mobilization, or a crisis in the West Philippine Sea. The economic damage and social chaos resulting from such an act would be catastrophic, effectively disabling the nation without a shot being fired. Beyond outright sabotage, the concentration of technical knowledge and operational influence in Chinese hands creates a continuous risk of intelligence leakage and operational dependence. The NGCP’s operational data like the consumption patterns of military bases, key industrial facilities, and government centers is sensitive information that we can’t allow to be leaked or handed down to a foreign power. Even if Filipino personnel perform the day-to-day operations, the involvement of Chinese nationals in key technical positions, including various high-ranking technical offices, suggests control beyond mere advisory roles. This placement allows for intimate knowledge of the grid’s weak points, maintenance schedules, and security protocols, information that could be invaluable to a rival power. Furthermore, if the proprietary technical manuals and advanced troubleshooting expertise are primarily held by NGCP’s Chinese partners, the country becomes perpetually dependent on an external entity to ensure the grid’s functioning, severely limiting the nation’s capacity for independent operation and maintenance. NGCP insists that there is “no single button” to shut down the grid. This defense misses the forest for the trees, as the concern is beyond the simple question of as to how the grid’s switch is turned on or off. It is the far more insidious ability to create cascading failures, disrupt specific regional activities, or introduce chronic instability in the whole country. The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) and TransCo have the mandate to regulate, yet its oversight capabilities are demonstrably hampered by the confidentiality surrounding the shareholders’ agreement and the highly technical nature of the grid’s core systems. Under the guise of improving efficiency and innovation by supposedly leveraging on the private sector’s management expertise and strong motivation as a compelling reason for the creation of the NGCP to operate the country’s power grid, the idea was but an anomaly from the beginning. At the time it was hatched, the experience in over two decades of privatization by over 100 countries who jumped into the bandwagon showed that it was not at all the silver bullet that everyone thought it would be to deliver desired national development, productivity and security: it was, after all, not a universally applicable solution. It carried significant risks and presented many downsides to a country’s wellbeing. Yet, when the idea was forced into play just before the end of President Gloria Arroyo’s term, it leaves one to wonder how our government economic managers then were quizzically clueless to the growing findings worldwide at the time. The result: a plethora of contradictions inimical to the interest of the people. It’s time for the government to take decisive action on the power grid’s existential considerations. It’s time for Congress to revive its past initiative in the 19th Congress to revisit this flawed franchise given to NGCP. Congress should now move to modify — even to the extent of scrapping — NGCP’s franchise if our national security is at constant risk. Congress should also insist now in forcing the disclosure of the controversial confidential shareholders’ agreement that serves to always stop the government from its tracks to insist its oversight rights on NGCP’s operation and technology use of the grid’s core systems. Critical infrastructure that forms the lifeblood of the nation cannot be left exposed to the strategic interests of any foreign power, especially like China with whom the country has current territorial and geopolitical disagreements. The power grid must be fully safeguarded, ensuring that the control of the nation’s electrical heart remain firmly in our own hands. – Rappler.com (You may reach the writer at densomera@yahoo.com)",True,true,[OPINION] NGCP’s vulnerability: The national security risk they don’t want us to talk about,https://www.rappler.com/business/opinion-national-grid-philippines-security-risk-china-control/,Rappler
"Rangsit, just north of Bangkok in Pathum Thani province, often slips past travelers. For most, it’s a commuter town, a stopover on the way to Don Mueang Airport or Ayutthaya. From the highway or the SRT, it passes in a blur of concrete flyovers and railway lines. But if you slow down, you’ll appreciate Bangkok’s quiet neighbor — humbler, gentler, stripped of the capital’s relentless pace but still full of its own little surprises. It’s the kind of place to stay if you want distance from Bangkok’s metropolitan rush, but still close enough to slip back into the city whenever you choose. If you happen to linger, here are four places where locals go when they’re hungry in Rangsit. By dawn, the marketplace along Soi Rangsit-Pathum Thani 7 is already alive. One side hums with butchers and fishmongers, with ducks hanging in rows and clams glistening on ice. Depending on the season, you might find stacks of durian or imported cherries and strawberries sitting beside mangoes and mangosteen. The other side is for the hungry. Moo ping — sweet, smoky pork skewers, flattened for easier eating — cost just 15 baht (P27). Rice porridge arrives in steaming bowls, fried chicken still crackles, and a pandan-flavored dough fried into the shape of a green hat goes three for 20 baht (P36). Beef noodles, tom yum, and pork cracklings round out the spread. A hundred baht (P180) is enough to taste plenty and stay full until noon, but it’s worth saving room for what comes later. By midday, the sun presses down hard. Along Phahonyothin Road, not far from Future Park, yellow umbrellas shade the entrance to Subaidah Chuanchim. From the outside, it looks like a roadside shop. It’s one of Rangsit’s most beloved halal spots. The chicken biryani stands out: golden rice served with a drumstick so tender it nearly falls apart. The duck, rich and full of flavor, is another favorite. Meals come quickly, but the room invites lingering. Prices range from 60 to 150 baht (P110 to P270). Families crowd the tables, students and office workers come for quick meals, and regulars return for the comfort of food that always tastes the same. When the afternoon slows, head down Soi Rangsit-Pathum Thani 10, where a small side street hides Mother’s House Noodles (Baan Mae). At first glance, it feels more like a garage than a restaurant, with its simple sign and a handful of metal tables, but regulars know it’s the spot for homestyle noodle bowls. The shop makes its own fresh egg noodles, springy and golden, paired with pork, chicken, or beef. Pork liver is also on the menu, but the house recommendation is the pork with meatball. The pork is cooked soft and tender, the meatballs springy and flavorful. A bowl costs just 50 to 70 baht (P90 to P125). It’s the kind of eatery where people come and go quickly. Office workers swing by during lunch, some idling their cars outside just long enough to grab takeaway. When we ate here during a sudden downpour, the lights went out, but the staff simply brought out battery lamps, laughing as they kept ladling soup. As evening falls, head back toward the canal where De Facto Cafe & Eatery glows like a greenhouse lit from within. Its glass walls and garden setting make it a popular wedding venue, but on an ordinary night it’s just a beautiful place to end the day. The menu mixes Thai favorites with Western touches. Fried sea bass with fish sauce is a house specialty, served with a dipping sauce that balances sweet, sour, and savory. The pork ribs come smoky and glazed, like a Thai riff on American barbecue. Even the stir-fried cabbage is irresistible, with enough wok flavor to make me — someone who abhors vegetables as a rule — want seconds. Dinner here averages 300 to 600 baht per person (P550 to P1,050), pricier than a street stall but well worth it for the setting. Couples linger over cocktails, families celebrate birthdays, and on some nights, live music carries across the water. Rangsit doesn’t have the obvious pull of tourist attractions. But it still does have one of Thailand’s favorite pastimes: the mall. Future Park is massive, a sprawl of interconnected halls that almost feels like SM Megamall back home. It’s big enough to double up on everything: two Starbucks, two Yayois, two Swensens. There’s no shortage of cafes here to fuel you up with Thai coffee and desserts. And of course, you can find inexpensive but surprisingly good-quality clothes, the kind you’d find in Chatuchak or Pratunam minus the crowds and hassle. Just across the street stands Major Cineplex, a throwback of a theater with carpeted floors and a touch of roaring ’20s design. It’s the kind of place that makes going to the movies feel like an occasion again. Rangsit deserves more than a glance out the train window. Like many gateway towns that sit at the threshold of sprawling capitals, it pieces together its own identity through small rituals: vendors arranging fruit before sunrise, motorcycles weaving through traffic at noon, families and students gathering for dinner. Unlike Bangkok, nothing here feels staged for the tourists; it’s simply local life as it carries on. And during nighttime convenience-store runs, when you find yourself trapped by the rain — because the rain will come in Thailand — slow down. Breathe. Watch the lights scatter across the puddles, and learn again how to wait as the world works around you. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Rangsit: Bangkok’s gateway, told through food",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/rangsit-bangkok-gateway-told-through-food/,Rappler
"The 13th-month pay is one of the most anticipated benefits for Filipino workers, serving as a mandatory, much-needed boost before the holidays. Understanding how it’s calculated and its tax implications is key to ensure employees are informed and can plan effectively for the season. The 13th-month pay is a mandatory benefit for all rank-and-file employees in the private sector who have worked for at least one month during the calendar year, as mandated by Presidential Decree No. 851. The computation is straightforward: it is equivalent to one-twelfth (1/12) of the total basic salary an employee earned during the calendar year. Pro-Rated Computation: If you have not worked for the full 12 months (e.g., you started mid-year, resigned, or were terminated), you are still entitled to a pro-rated 13th-month pay based on the total basic salary earned from your start date up to the date of computation or separation. The basic salary includes all remuneration or earnings paid by an employer to an employee for services rendered. It is the regular or fixed compensation for services, but generally excludes supplementary benefits. A significant benefit of the 13th-month pay in the Philippines is its non-taxable status up to a certain limit under the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law, or Republic Act 10963. Currently, the 13th-month pay and other benefits (like Christmas bonuses, productivity incentives, and other benefits not considered “de minimis”) are exempt from income tax up to a maximum aggregate amount of P90,000. This tax shield ensures that the majority of working Filipinos receive their full 13th-month pay, putting more cash directly into their pockets for year-end expenses. While the current law provides some relief, a proposed legislative measure aims to provide even greater financial comfort to Filipino workers. Senator Win Gatchalian’s GINHAWA Act (Granting Increase in Take-Home Pay for All Working Filipinos Act) is a bill seeking to expand tax exemptions for working Filipinos and is currently being deliberated in Congress. It is important to note that the GINHAWA Bill is a proposal, and its provisions are not yet law, nor are they enforceable. If the GINHAWA Bill were passed into law, it would bring about the following major changes that directly impact an employee’s take-home pay: The GINHAWA Bill, therefore, complements the existing 13th-month pay law by aiming to make not just the mandatory year-end benefit but also other earnings, especially those compensating for risky or extended work hours, substantially or fully tax-exempt. For all Filipino employees, staying informed about these benefits and proposed reforms is essential to secure the maximum benefit from their hard-earned income. The 13th-month pay, coupled with potential reforms like the GINHAWA Act, truly embodies the spirit of giving back to the country’s workforce. – Rappler.com ACG is the most trusted tax advisory firm in the Philippines, providing tax strategy, compliance, and policy advisory services to multinational corporations, foreign investors, and government institutions.

"MANILA, Philippines – Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Commissioner Charlito Mendoza said all letters of authority (LOAs) will now require his approval before they are issued as part of ongoing audit reforms to prevent its misuse. Mendoza disclosed this to the Senate blue ribbon committee hearing on Thursday, December 11. Prior to the announcement, LOAs – which usually signal the start of a tax audit – were issued at the regional level. “Right now po, when it comes to the issuance of letters of authority by the regional directors, meron po silang absolute authority to issue letters of authority. And hindi na po ito umaakyat sa Commissioner for approval or prior clearance,” he said. (Right now, the regional directors have absolute authority to issue letters of authority, and this is not escalated to the Commissioner for approval or prior clearance.) Mendoza also said that the BIR plans to limit the number of LOAs that taxpayers can receive to prevent its misuse. “These improvements, many of which can be enabled with the help of an integrated digital system, will reinforce the checks and balances between enforcement and oversight,” he said. The BIR originally suspended field audit operations following several reports that LOAs were used to extort bribes from businessmen and other taxpayers. Senators JV Ejercito and Erwin Tulfo claimed that BIR personnel kept as much as 70% from these collections. Despite its current misuse, former BIR commissioner Kim Henares said that LOAs remain an essential tool for effective collection, citing a study that found the BIR failed to collect P1 trillion in taxes due to tax evasion and related concerns. She said her office strictly monitored the issuance of LOAs during her term, and limiting its issuance was part of her audit plan. – Rappler.com",True,true,BIR chief Mendoza says all LOAs now require his clearance,https://www.rappler.com/business/bir-chief-mendoza-letter-authority-issuances-require-clearance/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Gregorio “Greg” Concepcion Brillantes, the award-winning Filipino fiction writer known for his short stories in English, died on Friday, September 26, as confirmed by a Facebook post of his nephew, Joey Brillantes. Greg was born in 1932 to a modest family in Tarlac, where his journey toward becoming a pillar of Philippine English literature began. As Joey noted: “He would become one of the Philippines’ most accomplished writers in English, noted for his elegant prose, subtle psychological insight, and the way he traversed both the real and the fantastical in his short stories.” Brillantes’ mastery lay not only in language but also in human emotion and the Filipino sensibility, touching and influencing generations of writers who came after him. “His short stories are studied in schools; his essays remain valued for their clarity and moral seriousness; his influence as editor and mentor shaped generations. Because his work balanced the personal and the political, the spiritual and the speculative, he helped expand what Philippine English literature could do,” Joey wrote. Esteemed writers and institutions have since paid tribute, among them Jose Dalisay, author of Killing Time in a Warm Place and Soledad’s Sister, who fondly remembered Brillantes as his “hero, mentor, and friend.” In his blog, Dalisay wrote that “a Brillantes story is an accretion of impressions, ideas, and emotions.” He urged young readers and writers to immerse themselves in the works of this great fictionist. Here’s where you can find some of Brillantes’ most impactful works that have cemented his legacy as one of the country’s greatest. One of his earliest and perhaps most well-known works is the short story, The Distance to Andromeda. It is included in one of his earliest short story collections, The Distance to Andromeda and Other Stories, which also featured Faith, Love, Time and Dr. Lazaro, The Exiles, and What Shall We Do When We All Go Out? The original edition was published in 1980 by National Book Store, with a later edition released by the University of the Philippines (UP) Press in 2000. Although now out of print, physical copies can still be accessed at the UP Diliman Main Library and the Gonzalo-Gonzalez Reading Room, though limited to room use. The Apollo Centennial: Nostalgias, Predicaments & Celebrations was his second short story collection, published in 1980. It is often regarded as one of his most remarkable forays into science fiction, using futuristic motifs to explore social and personal themes. Physical copies are available at the National Library of the Philippines and the UP Diliman College of Arts and Letters Library. In 2000, Anvil Publishing Inc. released his third collection of short stories, On a Clear Day in November, Shortly Before the Millennium: Stories for a Quarter Century. Both the National Library and the De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde are housing some of their physical copies, available for borrowing. Brillantes did not limit himself to fiction. As a young kid, his first immersive experience of literature came from discovering old issues of Philippines Free Press and Philippines Graphic, reading them voraciously and clipping stories, Joey said in his post. Years later, Brillantes became an editor for these publications, along with Sunburst, The Manila Review, Focus, and Asia-Philippines Leader. He ventured into non-fiction as well, publishing essay collections that were transformative and impactful in 2004. Looking for Jose Rizal in Madrid: Journeys, Latitudes, Perspectives, Destinations is available in De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde and in numerous UP campuses and colleges, including UP Diliman Main Library, and UP Tacloban Library. Physical copies of Chronicles of Interesting Times: Essays, Discourses, Gems of Wisdom, Some Laughs and Other Non-Biodegradable Articles can be found in numerous university libraries, including De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde, UP Baguio Library, and UP Diliman campus in their Main Library and the libraries of College of Arts and Letters and College of Education. Some of Brillantes’ works can also be accessed digitally. Tuklas, the UP Libraries’ Resource Discovery Tool, contains listings of his stories and essays with metadata and links to library holdings. Open Library hosts entries for The Apollo Centennial and other works, while Google Books provides previews and bibliographic information for The Distance to Andromeda and Other Stories and Chronicles of Interesting Times. Archium, Ateneo’s digital repository, includes a critical article titled A Reading of Gregorio Brillantes’ The Distance to Andromeda, available as a PDF. While most of his earlier works are now out of print and can only be accessed through libraries, his more recent publications remain available for purchase. These include his essay collection, The Cardinal’s Sins, The General’s Cross, The Martyr’s Testimony and Other Affirmations, and the short story compilation, The Collected Stories of Gregorio C. Brillantes, which features 39 of his award-winning stories from the 1950s to the 2000s, edited by Jonathan Chua. Both books are currently on sale through the Ateneo de Manila University Press for P505 and P695, respectively. Brillantes’ influence spans generations. His stories continue to be taught in classrooms, and, on the bookshelves of parents or grandparents, one might still find a well-worn copy of his work waiting to be rediscovered. A Palanca Hall of Famer and recipient of the Dangal ng Lahi Award from the Carlos Palanca Foundation in 2010, he was honored throughout his career for his literary achievements. – Trixia Policarpio/Rappler.com Trixia Policarpio is a Rappler intern studying BA Creative Writing at University of the Philippines Diliman.",True,true,Keeping his literary legacy alive: Where to read Greg Brillantes’ timeless works,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/literature/greg-brillantes-literary-works-available-libraries-online/,Rappler
"Leandro Leviste’s rise from clean-energy wunderkind to political crusader is not just a story about ambition or reform — it is a case study in how power, permissions, and timing intersect in the Philippine market. At the center is a renewable-energy platform that monetized contracts, franchises, and regulatory entitlements long before most megawatts were delivered, transferring execution risk from a politically connected founder to utilities, lenders, regulators, and ultimately consumers. Backed by a dynastic pedigree, enabled by Duterte-era political capital, and capped by a multibillion-peso exit to Meralco, the SPNEC–Solar Philippines saga exposes how clean energy can be financialized ahead of performance — and how “performance politics,” when layered onto unfinished infrastructure, becomes not reform but a new market risk that the public ends up paying for. On October 27, 2025, Leandro Leviste executed a block sale of 10.83 billion shares in SP New Energy Corp. (SPNEC) to the Meralco group. The headline number — ₱13.76 billion — was large enough to drown out the only question that ultimately matters: what, exactly, was being valued? The public narrative unfolded predictably. A young founder monetizes a vision. A blue-chip utility buys scale. Philippine renewables enter their institutional phase. Yet SPNEC is not a traditional power company anchored on operating cash flows. What Meralco’s renewable arm acquired was a platform dominated by development-stage assets — service contracts, land positions, permits, project companies, and expectations — priced on the assumption that delivery would follow. That delivery may still come. But while the timing of value creation matters because it exposes how the country’s renewable-energy framework can be gamed, what is also important is why markets should care. This was not a one-off exit. SPNEC disclosures show that Leviste’s holding companies agreed to sell 14.60 billion shares to Meralco’s MGen for ₱18.26 billion, while earlier transactions — including the public float — brought cumulative sold shares to 16.44 billion for about ₱20.49 billion by mid-2025. By late October, market coverage increasingly framed the divestment arc as targeting more than ₱34 billion in proceeds as the Meralco transactions progressed. These figures do not describe the monetization of a mature operating utility. They describe the monetization of optionality — the right to build, the right to claim capacity, the right to be “in the pipeline,” and the right to sit at the intersection of policy, planning, and capital. What this timeline showsThis is a story of sequencing: visibility, first; permissions, second; contracts, third; monetization, fourth, and reform rhetoric, last. Markets read this pattern instinctively — even when politics prefers not to. This dynamic is not unique to one firm. It is embedded in the system. The Renewable Energy (RE) Service Contracts for development rights and the Green Energy Auction Program (GEAP) for securing power supply agreements can award scale far faster than it can enforce delivery. In well-governed markets, that gap is managed through strict milestones, performance bonds, swift terminations, and penalties that discourage speculation. In weakly policed markets, the gap becomes a business model. The most significant risk signal in the Solar Philippines ecosystem is therefore not ideology or personality. It is the widening gulf between awarded capacity and completed capacity. In October 2024, the Department of Energy (DOE) disclosed that 21 of the 42 service contracts awarded to Solar Philippines were facing discontinuance or termination for failure to meet commitments. That matters on two levels. First, the Philippines plans its grid as if awarded capacity will be delivered. When developers miss timelines at scale, the country does not merely lose a handful of solar farms; it loses assumed future supply embedded in planning models. The shortfall is paid for through higher-cost generation, tighter reserves, and recurring alerts. Second, this mismatch is precisely what turns “clean energy” into a financial instrument. In markets, expectations can be sold. Projects can be priced before they produce. If enforcement is slow or forgiving, the economic reward shifts from building megawatts to accumulating the permissions to someday build megawatts. What this scorecard shows:SPNEC is not merely an aggressive developer — it is an outlier. Its value creation has been driven more by permissions and proximity than by electrons delivered to the grid. That does not make it illegal. It makes it systemically risky. It is impossible for me to do forensics on this platform without confronting the role of political lineage. Leviste is not merely an aggressive entrepreneur; he is the product of a political dynasty whose influence has long extended across media, legislation, and policy. In May 2024, Leviste made a surprise move into the media sector, acquiring an 8.5% stake in ABS-CBN — then deeply discounted after losing its franchise during the Duterte administration. The transaction instantly lifted the stock, reinforcing a pattern already familiar to market participants: when Leviste moves, prices move. On its face, the ABS-CBN investment was opportunistic value-hunting. But the context mattered. Leviste had no background in media. His mother, Loren Legarda, was one of ABS-CBN’s most prominent anchors for over a decade before entering politics. Solar Philippines’ own social-media accounts framed the acquisition as a symbolic, almost familial gesture — complete with archival images of Legarda at the anchor desk and Leviste as a child. Nothing illegal here. But it was instructive. It illustrated how personal history, political capital, and market positioning intertwine — and how investors read those signals. Influence does not always operate through direct intervention. Sometimes it operates through credibility transfer: the implicit assurance that doors will open, risks will be managed, and outcomes will be navigable. The same pattern is visible in energy. In 2017, then president Rodrigo Duterte personally attended the launch of Solar Philippines’ manufacturing facility in Batangas, conferring early presidential visibility on a young company seeking scale. Two years later, Duterte signed Republic Act 11357, granting Solar Para sa Bayan — a Leviste-owned firm — a 25-year franchise with unusually broad scope. The law was valid. But its effect was unmistakable. It transformed a business plan into a permission structure with bankable value. Dynasties rarely pass down cash; they pass down access, franchises, and regulatory pathways that can later be monetized. Critics at the time noted the speed with which the franchise moved through Congress and the intensity of lobbying behind it. Leviste denied that his mother played a role. But market actors do not trade on denials alone. They trade on probability — and on patterns. SPNEC’s balance sheet reinforces what kind of company it is. Its interim filings show a platform actively leveraging up to fund development, managing hedges, and monetizing scale through institutional capital. That is normal for a development platform — but decisive for understanding risk. In its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form 17-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, SPNEC disclosed that Terra Solar signed a ₱150-billion, 15-year Omnibus Loan and Security Agreement with six banks and had already drawn ₱25.15 billion. In the same filing, it reported a ₱688.7-million loss from foreign-exchange futures designated as cash-flow hedges. No longer are these footnotes, but signals. Once a company draws ₱25 billion against a ₱150-billion facility before generating operating cash, tolerance for delay collapses. Every month of slippage compounds financing costs and narrows the margin for error. Currency and procurement exposure is real; hedging losses are the market cost of funding large projects whose equipment and Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contracts are linked to foreign exchange (FX). [Vantage Point] Why green energy is failing) Most critically, the equity story now depends on execution without misstep. Development platforms look strongest in their promise phase and most fragile in delivery — a transition that markets routinely misprice. That is why institutionalization cuts both ways. In March 2025, global investor Actis completed a US$600-million transaction for a 40% stake in Terra Solar through Meralco’s renewable unit. This is patient capital. It raises the probability of delivery — but it also raises the bar. Scale backed by that level of financing leaves little room for narrative drift. Where concern deepens is not in any single deal, but in how incentives align. Leviste monetized his platform, crystallized liquidity, and only then stepped fully into politics — armed with a high-profile exposé aimed squarely at the current administration. (READ: Who else got hold of the ‘Cabral files’ prior to her death?) By targeting the present government’s public-works apparatus while leaving largely untouched the Duterte-era political ecosystem that accelerated his own rise, Leviste’s crusade begins to look less like neutral reform and more like political force projection. Anti-corruption becomes selective. Transparency becomes asymmetric. In infrastructure markets, this matters. Political uncertainty widens regulatory risk premia, raises the cost of long-gestation capital, and encourages defensive policymaking. Performance politics becomes a market externality, especially when the performer sits atop a platform dependent on long-term policy stability. Meralco’s involvement undeniably strengthens the platform. The most charitable interpretation is that a developer with scale was absorbed by a utility capable of execution. But that institutional muscle also sharpens the accountability question. If the renewable transition is to be built on platforms that can be sold before they produce, the Philippines must confront whether it is comfortable with a clean-energy market where the most valuable asset is not generation, but permission — and where political proximity can be monetized long before the first megawatt arrives. In my opinion, the remedy is procedural, not rhetorical. Faster enforcement of milestones. Tougher performance bonds. Transparent, contract-level delivery dashboards. Stricter disclosure standards for development-stage valuations. And a clear separation between political branding and infrastructure governance. Because the country does not run on narratives. It runs on electrons. And until execution catches up with monetization, the SPNEC-Solar Philippines ecosystem will remain a case study in how Philippine clean energy can drift from a national imperative into a tradable instrument — priced on promises, protected by patience, and settled in cash long before delivery is complete. Doing so would mean depending solely on market mechanisms that would not result in stable consumer prices, real emission reductions, evenhanded community development, and genuine energy security for our country. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] The Leviste gambit: Monetizing clean energy for political gains?,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-leandro-leviste-gambit-clean-energy-monetization/,Rappler

"MANILA, Philippines – When Filipino pastry chef Nouel Catis first created his Fix Bar in Dubai in 2021, it didn’t immediately take off. However, after three years, the chocolate bar suddenly sparked interest when a TikTok video of someone cracking open their dessert creation went viral. It garnered millions of views and turned it into one of the Middle East’s most viral desserts. Now, Catis, who grew up in Dipolog selling his mother’s baked goods at school, is the face of the viral Dubai Chocolate pistachio bar, which has gained immense popularity around the world. There have been many local iterations of the chocolate bar by small businesses over the past year, but the award-winning Davao-based brand Auro Chocolate carries maybe the most “authentic” version yet, in collaboration with chef Catis himself. Auro Chocolate and SNA’AP Manila — a dessert shop founded by Catis — have teamed up for a special collaboration of two new Dubai chocolate bars, available at all major Kultura stores in Metro Manila. It’s the first direct collaboration of Catis with a local chocolatier. But before this, Catis has been supporting Auro since 2017, helping them develop their recipes in Auro Chocolate Bahrain, which opened in 2022. The Pistachio and Kunafa bar is a nod to the Dubai hit, and the Ube Baklava bar is a Manila exclusive. Both highlight the texture that made the Fix Bar famous — kataifi, or shredded phyllo pastry, which adds a crisp crunch to balance out the creamy fillings. The Pistachio and Kunafa is compact in size but thick, decorated just like the viral bar, and is meant to be cracked open in the middle. While the filling isn’t as oozy as what you see online, it’s packed with buttery flavor: the nuttiness of roasted pistachio comes through, layered with the addictive crunch of kunafa. The Ube Baklava is a strong local contender; inside, the ube filling tastes real and not artificial, making this variant proudly known as a Filipino specialty. There is a slight nutty sesame flavor from the tahini paste. Both chocolate bars use Auro’s single-origin 42% Milk Chocolate. The bars cost P575 each.

"United States President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have wrapped up a meeting in South Korea with a deal to keep Chinese rare earth exports flowing. Here are some basic facts about these obscure elements making headlines around the world: Rare earths are a group of 17 elements including 15 silvery-white metals called lanthanides, or lanthanoids, plus scandium and yttrium. Rare earths or the magnets which they are sometimes made into can be found in small but important quantities in everything from iPhones and washing machines to the F35 fighter jet. They are also used in electric vehicles (EVs), medical equipment, oil refining, and other military applications such as missiles and radar systems. Without them, supply chains quickly grind to a halt. Automakers were forced to paused some production earlier this year after Chinese export controls caused shortages. They are not rare in the sense that they are uncommon; some are more common than lead, for example. But they tend to be spread thin around the Earth’s crust in small quantities and mixed together or with other minerals, so larger deposits are difficult to find and costly to extract. While US scientists helped developed a process to separate and refine rare earths in the 1950s, China since the 1980s has come to dominate the industry thanks to lower costs, laxer environmental standards, and decades of government support. China accounts for about 60% of global mine production and 90% or more of refined production and rare earth magnet output. Projects are underway across the US, Europe, and Australia to build an alternative supply chain but it will take years to produce meaningful quantities. In the meantime, China is restricting exports of an increasing number of the elements and the equipment needed to mine and refine them. In their periodic table order, they are: scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium. Processing rare earths often involves the use of solvents, which can produce toxic waste that pollutes the soil, water, and atmosphere. More environmentally friendly technologies are being developed, but they are not yet widely used. Certain types of rare earth ores also contain radioactive thorium or uranium, which is often removed using acid. For this reason, development of the sector faces health and environmental regulatory hurdles. – Rappler.com",True,true,FAST FACTS: What are rare earths and why are they so important?,https://www.rappler.com/business/things-to-know-rare-earths-elements-names-meaning-uses-trade-china/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Pursed lips, a soft wince, and that familiar asim (sourness) that wakes up the palate. We all know the experience of suka (vinegar). As Filipinos, we love our vinegar: it’s that sour kick that contrasts our richer, meatier dishes, and the brightness to our kinilaws and ensaladas. Not only is it the best partner to dried fish, but it is the savory-sour foundation of our adobo, and more. And this love isn’t new. “Vinegar has been around since pre-colonial times,” culinary consultant and chef Bettina Arguelles told audiences at November’s Terra Madre Asia Pacific Festival, the Asia Pacific region’s biggest sustainable gastronomy event, held in Bacolod for the first time. Because of our tropical climate, she said, our ancestors relied heavily on vinegar, salt, and other souring agents to season and preserve food while traveling or working the land. What was once a simple preservation technique has helped shape the flavor profile of Filipino food today. However, while vinegar remains one of the most commonly used ingredients in Filipino kitchens, most of it is commercially manufactured. The art of making our oldest forms of vinegar — traditionally made, laboriously fermented, and naturally sourced — is quietly fading away. Making Bulacan’s sukang sasa (nipa palm) is tedious and time-consuming. Chef Angelo Comsti, founder of Offbeat Bistro, recounts his award-winning story of Eddie Marcelino, a 75-year-old artisan who’s been making the traditional vinegar for almost half a century. Marcelino’s daily routine begins at five in the morning in Pabongbong, Bulacan, long considered the capital of sukang sasa. Before sunrise, he rides a wobbly bangka (boat) through the 1,500-square-meter marshland swamp his grandfather once owned, with his trusty wooden sinisikaran, a tool wrapped in rubber, looking for nipa trees. Instead of kicking the trunks, as old practice dictated, he taps the stalks of the nipa palm fruit for weeks to extract the sap; this method is less physically taxing and doesn’t “hurt” the tree as much. When the fruits are ready, he cuts the bunch, ties a bottle beneath the stalk, and lets the juice seep slowly into the container. He religiously does this for three consecutive weeks. “Dapat huwag isasagad,” Marcelino told Comsti. “Dapat itigil na kung paubos na ang katas. Huwag iyong simot na simot.” (Don’t max it out; you should stop just before the sap totally runs out.) If you drain it too much, the tree weakens. Give it six months to recover, and the tree can produce sap again. He pours the murky white liquid into a tapayan, a large earthenware jar used to store liquids, and covers it up with rubber tires. He reserves some to drink as tuba, the traditional nipa wine, which his loyal customers usually order. Marcelino lets the liquid ferment until foamy (“like beer,” Comsti shared) and pungent for two weeks, then transfers the vinegar into reused five-gallon containers. On a good day, he produces about five buckets. But when it rains, his output is less. He sells the sukang sasa for around P100 each — “a measly amount for the load of work it requires,” Comsti said. A middleman transports the vinegar to the public market in Calumpit or nearby towns, where it is sold at a higher price. The job requires a lot from Marcelino, whose body is aging, but he doesn’t complain. He said that he prefers this work to the sweltering plastic corporation job he once had in Manila. He does not need to answer to anyone, and his earnings have put his five children through school. “Ironically, sending his children to school has made him aware of professions beyond the farm and has consequently curbed their interest in taking on their father’s job,” Comsti shared. The youngest of the brood, the only one who lives with Marcelino and his wife Angelina, is not “at least one bit curious about what his father does.” But the septuagenarian artisan continues the legacy his grandfather and father left him. However, the generational gap isn’t the only problem. Pollution is worsening, and nipa groves are disappearing. Plantations are becoming fishponds, and hectares of palm trees are being cleared to become pools of breeding fish; these provide higher incomes. “The odds are against Marcelino,” Comsti said, but he is not ready to give up his family’s long-standing tradition that easily. “He promises that as long as there are patches of nipa in his backyard and God allows him to take to the streets, there will be sukang sasa.” The vinegar he produces is unlike any commercial bottle: it’s clean, smooth, almost cider-like in aroma and taste, slightly creamy in consistency, and can be sipped on its own. Its fruity acidity is stringent but not sharp; it sings on the tongue but does not sting. “To save it, we need to consume more of it, to appreciate it, and to acknowledge it,” Comsti said. “It’s important that we are able, as chefs, to keep this heritage in an inspired way,” Arguelles added. Aside from cooking with native ingredients, telling these stories keeps the cultural legacy alive. Understanding the history of an ingredient reminds us of its importance. Before the kitchen, vinegar was used for daily life: as folk medicine, disinfectant, herbicide, and even a cleansing agent. Vinegar proves that our regions are adaptable. Across the archipelago, communities developed unique kinds based on what was abundant around them — coconut (sukang tuba), cane, nipa, kaong palm (sukang irok), and more. In Ilocos, households cooked down their vinegar into lamayo for preserving fish. “We are #TeamAsim!” chefs Arguelles, Comsti, and Tina Legarda of Bamba Bistro cheered on stage. Legarda gushes over vinegar; it is as important to her as salt. Growing up, her family kept an entire closet dedicated to different vinegars in old jars, and her “sour journey” has helped mold how she conceptualizes her dishes. “What I love about our cuisine is we’re thoughtful enough to think of ways to balance the whole meal out,” Legarda said. Vinegar is used for pickling or buro; fruits and vegetables like papaya, mango, radish, and mustard greens are used for atchara, a refreshingly tart side dish best eaten with our fried dishes. Many enjoy vinegar as a condiment, and that’s Legarda’s favorite way, too. “It’s very personal,” she said — like how a whole table goes quiet when everyone starts mixing their own sawsawan (dipping sauce) for chicken inasal. Some households like their suka with onions and chili; others add cucumbers. It’s a customizable ritual according to one’s own preference. There’s no right or wrong way. Heirloom vinegars require a lot. Time, skill, resources, and patience for fermentation — things that this new generation may not be able to offer as much. “It’s a very laborious endeavor to be able to produce it,” Arguelles said, but that is exactly why we need to keep the tradition alive. Supermarkets carry the fast, commercial varieties labeled as “imitation vinegar.” It has a shorter processing time and uses cheaper chemicals to allow mass production. But what these chefs want Filipinos to experience is the distinct quality homegrown vinegar has to offer — it tastes different, adds a unique depth to dishes, and supports hardworking Filipinos who respect nature just to produce the cherished and versatile product. “We thought that it was important for the younger generation to rediscover our indigenous and local ingredients and how those tastes,” Arguelles said. “They are normally getting taken for granted because it’s such a humble or simple ingredient that we see in our pantries every day.” And as Eddie Marcelino continues to till the land and provide for his family, for the chefs at Terra Madre, the call is simple: Use more local vinegars. Talk about them. Create with them. Celebrate them. Share these stories online. Bring them outside of their regions and into more homes, markets, food festivals, and restaurant kitchens. Tradition doesn’t have to die, as long as we don’t let it. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Why we need to keep the art of ‘sukang sasa,’ the vinegar of the nipa palm, alive",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/sukang-sasa-traditional-vinegar-nipa-palm/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — In juggling their studies, extracurricular activities, and varying personal circumstances, many college students feel overwhelmed. And without proper rest and relaxation, some students may end up demotivated or anxious over the immense pressure. That’s why some universities aim to address this by acknowledging the importance of mental health and establishing initiatives and organizations to help students deal with their school workload, hectic schedule, and other personal concerns. Here are some of the schools ready to give a hand. Established in 2020, the Thomasian Mental Health Responders (TMHR) is a community service advocacy program handled by the University of Santo Tomas. Open to Thomasians and non-Thomasians alike, the TMHR is made up of volunteers from different sectors in UST — students, alumni, and faculty members of the Department of Psychology from the College of Sciences — who are trained to provide free mental health care and psychosocial support to those who need it. A post shared by Thomasian Mental Health Responders (@ust.tmhr) TMHR provides telecounseling sessions to students through online meeting platforms like Google Meet, Zoom, and also Facebook Messenger whether via video call or voice call. Note that TMHR doesn’t provide diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, or certificates for sessions with clients, as also indicated in its Google Form when interested students sign up. A post shared by Thomasian Mental Health Responders (@ust.tmhr) Last February, the program offered physical group sessions due to the fatal incident at the footbridge in front of the España-based university. In March, it set up a dedicated wellness area in the university called Soothify Premium — a wordplay on Spotify Premium — where students were offered various ways to to relax, calm down, or just get a needed break. The area featured five different stations: the Fidget Station, the Snack Station, the Meditation Station, Paper Station, and the Book Nook. A post shared by Thomasian Mental Health Responders (@ust.tmhr) TMHR is available from Mondays to Saturdays from 8 am to 8 pm, with last calls for sessions starting at 7 pm. The State university makes sure to offer mental health programs as well. Across the different University of the Philippines campuses, many student-led organizations have been vocal about the mental welfare of students and faculty alike, including Sandigan, Sandalan, an all-around support system for the nation’s scholars. Established in 2021, the Sandigan, Sandalan program is a collaborative effort of the professors across the UP System that initially aimed to provide mental health services to students and faculty during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many projects were granted under the support of this program, its most notable project is the “Training on Mental Health Promotion in the Teaching-Learning Environment.” The training team, composed mainly of UP system professors, alongside resource speakers both in and out of the university, guides UP faculty members and staff of the university’s Office of Student Affairs on how to discuss mental healthcare during classes and extracurriculars. The Mental Health Act by De La Salle University is modeled directly after Republic Act 11036, also known by the same name. The policy was incorporated by the student body’s University Student Government after a year of trying to enact change in the Taft-based university. Currently, this policy is under the administration of the Lasallian Center for Inclusion, Diversity and Wellbeing (LCIDW), in collaboration with the school’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS). A post shared by Lasallian Center for Inclusion, Diversity, and Well-being (@dlsu_lcidw) Outlined in the Mental Health Act are many changes to mental health approaches in the school, including the students’ rights to be referred to licensed psychiatrists for diagnosis and to be provided psychologists on campus who would attend to their needs. “The previous rules were sort of not in favor of students, like the chances [that you’re] gonna fail all your classes, if you, all of a sudden couldn’t attend, your professor wouldn’t be obliged to give you consideration for that,” said USG Office of the President chief policy adviser Karen Lim in a 2021 interview with The LaSallian. They offer on site and online individual and group counseling during the school’s class hours, including a recent post-disaster counseling. For this year’s World Mental Health Month, LCIDW and CPS promote mental health awareness with the theme “Pause. Support. Prevent: Building a Culture of Mental Wellness” with a lineup of activities such as psychological first aid training and wellness checks in the classroom. The Ateneo Bulatao Center is open to everyone in and out of the school community. Named after the founding father of the school’s Psychology Department, the service center is mainly known for its counseling and psychotherapy services: one that’s exploratory, and the other as regular sessions. The Brief Psychological Services (BPS) is a non-specialized psychosocial support program as it trains graduate students of the university to provide mental health care. It offers one to two counseling sessions in line with the service center’s research goal in providing short-term intervention before proper diagnosis. Therapy sessions can be conducted for individuals and couples. Those interested can book an intake session at P2,800 with succeeding sessions priced at P2,500, while couples can go together at P4,500, with succeeding sessions at P4,000. One of the oldest state universities in Northern Luzon isn’t new to pushing for mental wellness within and beyond the four walls of the classroom. In December 2024, BS Psychology students from the University of Northern Philippines in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, helped facilitate the Mental Health Fair for Adolescents, with the theme “Let’s Stand Against the Stigma and Protect your Mental Health.” The event was held in collaboration with the Provincial Health Office and the Provincial Youth Development Office of Ilocos Sur. In October 2023, Universidad de Manila in Ermita launched the “Health Care for All” program; as aligned with the “Good Health and Well-being” of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal. This program was the product of the university’s College of Health Sciences, Medical Unit, and the Guidance Counseling Office for the students in need of therapy and intervention. UDM president Dr. Ma. Felma Carlos-Tria affirms the importance of the university’s program during its launch. “Mental health is a crucial component of overall well-being. By offering these services to our staff and students, we aim to create a safe and supportive environment where everyone feels cared for and empowered to seek help when needed.” The “Health Care for All” program offers free medical assessments, counseling sessions spearheaded by mental health professionals, and other activities that help emotional and psychological wellbeing. In April 2024, the UDM-based initiative contributed to the overall welfare of its neighboring barangay during its community health program for the families in Sta. Ana, Manila. The community health program was spearheaded by members of the UDM Nursing Student Council, under the mentorship of Dr. Felicitas Hubbard and Dr. Rhodora Bernal, the dean of the College of Health Sciences. Not only did the residents benefit from the free mental health services, they also received free fluoride applications, pap smears, and breast examinations, in collaboration with the Philippine Cancer Society. In March, the Polytechnic University of the Philippines’ Office of Counseling and Psychological Services invited the faculty members and administrative staff to the community-based mental health training program. The training program focused on mental health literacy and taught the participants about mental health screening tools which provided them means in giving aid to students. They were also given copies of the world standard Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. – Rappler.com Juliana Chloe Gonzales is a Rappler intern studying AB Communication Arts at De La Salle University.",True,true,School support: How PH universities address students’ mental health,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/philippine-universities-address-students-mental-health/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Two years after they ceased operations, news channels DZMM and Teleradyo will be revived through rebranding efforts from the Philippine Collective Media Corporation (PCMC) and Media Serbisyo Production Corporation. This was announced in a statement posted online on Thursday, May 29. PCMC will be rebranding DWPM Radyo 630 to DZMM Radyo Patrol 630, effective 8 pm on Thursday, May 29. Similarly, Media Serbisyo Production Corporation will be rebranding its Teleradyo Serbisyo program to DZMM Teleradyo. The programs will feature familiar names in broadcasting, such as Noli de Castro, Charo Santos, Doris Bigornia, and Alvin Elchico. This comes after news giant ABS-CBN, which previously owned DZMM and Teleradyo, entered a joint venture with House Speaker Martin Romualdez’s Prime Media Holdings Incorporated in 2023. The two formed a joint venture company, Media Serbisyo Production Corporation, which produces various news programs to be supplied to broadcasters, including PCMC. In May 2023, ABS-CBN announced its plans to cease operations for Teleradyo due to mounting losses, but it revived its old radio call sign and frequency, DZMM 630 kHz, under the joint venture with Romualdez’s Prime Media. This led to the launch of DWPM Radyo 630, which aired programs anchored by veteran ABS-CBN journalists. ABS-CBN lost its legislative franchise in 2020, affecting its television and radio operations. Lawmakers have sought to grant the media giant a fresh franchise, but their bills have languished in Congress. – Rappler.com",True,true,"DZMM, Teleradyo return after 2 years",https://www.rappler.com/nation/dzmm-teleradyo-comeback-may-2025/,Rappler
"Not only are local governments and water districts terminating or preparing to terminate their joint venture agreements with the Villars’ PrimeWater, but subcontractors are also lining up over unpaid bills, Rappler has learned. We obtained documents of a subcontractor trying to collect P75 million worth of overdue bills from PrimeWater, which cover different works for several water districts that went into a joint venture partnership with PrimeWater. This subcontractor, who requested anonymity, is not alone. Rappler also obtained a billing from private firm Bacolod Bulk Water Inc (BBWI), trying to collect P7.9 million in outstanding payments from PrimeWater due on Friday, December 12. The billing covers unpaid obligations from August 1 to October 31. Senator Raffy Tulfo, chairperson of the public works committee which has begun investigating PrimeWater, said a contractor had relayed similar problems. “We also received a complaint from a contractor providing non-revenue water and maintenance services across multiple PrimeWater sites nationwide. They’re seeking assistance for their uncollected billings amounting to more than P90 million overdue since March 2023,” Tulfo said on December 3. PrimeWater, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prime Asset owned by Manuel Paolo Villar, is under multiple investigations for allegedly defaulting on their obligations to the water districts. Rappler had earlier reported on the suffering of their consumers under agreements that were allegedly faulty from the start. PrimeWater grew exponentially under the Duterte administration, when Manuel Paolo’s brother, Senator Mark Villar, was the Department of Public Works and Highways secretary. The Local Water Utilities Administration or LWUA, which oversees water districts, is an agency attached to the DPWH, a conflict of interest for Mark Villar. Rappler emailed and sent a Viber message to Prime Asset’s communication officer on December 8 and 9, but we have yet to receive a response. We will update this story if and when we get a response. Rappler was able to speak with the contractor who said the total outstanding payable has actually reached P150 million. The source said PrimeWater subcontracts its construction work to their own firm, MGS construction, which then subcontracts to other companies including theirs, the source said. MGS Construction is owned by Villar associate Jerry Navarrete. The source said the difficulty collecting payment from PrimeWater began in 2023, which was also the time that the management kept changing, the source added. PrimeWater, we were told, has offered payment plan alternatives, such as paying with a lot property. The latest payment plan offer, the source said, was for Allbank — a thrift bank of the Villar group — to extend their credit lines. That way, the subcontractor can finance the project through Allbank loans, in lieu of their own financing if only PrimeWater had paid diligently. The billings obtained by Rappler show that the subcontractor was also collecting P4 million from paying interest on the Allbank loans. The source said that while PrimeWater offered to be the guarantor on the loan, they also could not pay the interest afterwards, forcing them to shoulder the interest charges in the meantime so they could “make further drawbacks in the loan.” The source said they have had to retrench 10 employees because of the financial difficulty caused by PrimeWater. “If this continues in the next two months, we might have the tendency to fold the business,” the source added. On the request of the source, we are not disclosing the nature of the subcontracts and the water districts. But these are subcontracts for as low as P5 million to as high as P90 million. Yet PrimeWater still reported a P1.35-billion comprehensive income in their 2024 financial statement. Their assets were worth P40.5 billion. “Napaisip po tayo kung kaya ‘nyong kumita ng bilyon, bakit hindi ‘nyo po kayang maglabas para sa sahod at bayarin sa mga contractors?” said Tulfo. (I wondered why if you can earn a billion, why can’t you spend for the salary and payables to contractors?) Renee Co, representative of Kabataan Partylist and a lawyer, said there should be a criminal investigation into “what may be considered fraud and bad-faith business practice.” Co and the progressive Makabayan bloc has been pushing to terminate all PrimeWater joint venture agreements in their cause to stop privatization of a public service. We checked the audit reports of the water districts where the source worked and found that PrimeWater had also run into financial troubles in these areas. In one water district, PrimeWater allegedly did not pay the taxes that they’re supposed to shoulder under their contract, and did not increase the profit share of the water district even though the latter chipped in for the repairs. In another water district, PrimeWater allegedly did not pay for manpower, labor, and equipment even if the contract stipulates it to be their responsibility. In two water districts, PrimeWater allegedly also did not fulfill the investments they committed to under the joint venture. Tulfo questioned PrimeWater over this same issue during a September 25 hearing, as several other water districts complained that the Villar company did not actually implement what they promised to do under their capital expenditures (capex). Capital expenditure refers to funds used to buy, upgrade, or maintain long-term assets. Capex is important because this is what will enable PrimeWater to increase charges on consumers. If PrimeWater builds and expands facilities under capex, they can then go to the regulators to justify increasing their charges. PrimeWater consumers have complained about high charges, but no actual water supply. “It goes on and on and on, halos lahat (almost all), ang dami nang nag-terminate ng contract because of that (so many have terminated contracts because of that),” said Tulfo, meaning, that almost all partner water districts were found by auditors to have capex shortcoming by PrimeWater. “Pikit-mata pumayag sila kasi ang ganda ng offer ‘nyo, gaganda nga ang service kung ganito, half a billion ang i-iinfuse ‘nyong capital. Sino ba naman ang local water district na hindi papayag pero nabudol sila, ang dami ‘nyo pong nabudol,” said Tulfo. (The water districts agreed blindly because your offers were so good, service will really improve if you were going to infuse half a billion in capital. No water district will say no to this, but they were fooled, you fooled so many.) PrimeWater president Roberto Fabrique disputed a figure for one water district, but this did not satisfy Tulfo who was reading off a Commission on Audit (COA) report. “This is a breach of contract…the water district can get the bond, or ask PrimeWater to comply, or pre-terminate if they don’t want [it] anymore,” said Assistant Government Corporate Counsel Tricia Velasco-Catera. Collecting performance bonds from PrimeWater, however, has also been a challenge for water districts. Rappler’s research has found that 41 water districts out of the 77 PrimeWater partners have failed to forfeit performance bonds, including the water district that the source subcontracted for. This means they have not pursued their rightful claims. One of the water districts representative told the Senate that they couldn’t collect the bonds from the insurance company without PrimeWater’s consent. The Insurance Commission suggested mediation, or filing for a claim. Some water districts or local governments have resorted to termination of the contract, but when that happens, PrimeWater always just runs to the courts. “More often than not, the TRO is granted,” said Tulfo. That’s what happened in La Union. There’s a local win in San Fernando, Pampanga when Mayor Vilma Caluag unilaterally suspended PrimeWater’s business permit. PrimeWater sought a temporary restraining order from the court. A San Fernando, Pampanga Regional Trial Court denied the TRO on December 2. According to Tulfo, half of the 77 partner water districts have either unilaterally terminated the agreement, or issued a pre-termination notice. “The suggestion is don’t go to court, if the joint venture is canceled, don’t go to court, can you do that?” Tulfo asked PrimeWater during the December 3 hearing. “With all due respect, I cannot decide on that,” said Fabrique. In Bacolod, when PrimeWater partnered with the water district, the Villar firm just assumed existing subcontracts from private extraction firms such as BBWI, according to Councilor Wilson Gamboa Jr. He has been pushing to get rid of PrimeWater which “did not bring a drop of water to Bacolod,” Gamboa told Rappler in a phone interview on Friday. BBWI had sent a notice of disconnection to PrimeWater, but Gamboa — who is in contact with the water district — said there are ongoing negotiations so that BBWI does not disconnect “for general welfare.” Gamboa said the city council is trying to issue a resolution to push Mayor Greg Gasataya to issue a show cause order to PrimeWater, as a leadup to suspending the mayor’s business permit. PrimeWater made a commitment to pay to BBWI on December 13, two days after Rappler published its first report, and a day after the disconnection deadline, averting a major water crisis in the city. Gamboa, who is part of a pending petition in the Supreme Court against PrimeWater, said the revocation of a mayor’s business permit might be the most viable option. “We have two options, to bring it to the proper court, which is a protracted, long, tedious and expensive litigation, and settlements. Or business cancelation. We are looking at option two,” said Gamboa. Co said criminal complaints must be initiated soon, as termination proceedings “take years” and the Malacañang-mandated LWUA investigation is “often slow and politically pressured.” “Without criminal cases, what is happening is only damage control, not real justice. The state ends up merely ‘regulating’ the abuse instead of actively defending the public and holding powerful corporations accountable,” said Co. – with research from Shay Du/Rappler.com",True,true,"PrimeWater allegedly not paying contractors, water districts: ‘Dami ’nyong nabudol’",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/villar-primewater-also-not-paying-subcontractors/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – What would the Philippines look like if Filipinos fully embraced an organic lifestyle? According to recent data, Filipino consumers are becoming increasingly health-conscious. A 2025 report by PwC showed that 67% of Filipinos consider nutritional value when buying food. Meanwhile, a separate study by Food Industry Asia found that 99% of Filipino consumers want to practice mindful eating, with many calling on the food industry to make healthier options more accessible. Despite this interest, organic consumption remains limited. Marco Schlüter, managing director for strategy and international affairs at Naturland e.V., shared a 2022 study by Climate Tracker Asia that found that while 32% of Filipinos occasionally purchase organic food products, only 25% buy them frequently. This suggests that awareness does not always translate into consistent behavior. The trend aligns with global growth. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global organic food and beverages market was valued at US$231.52 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $564.22 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual rate (CAGR) of 13.9% from 2024 to 2030. One of the primary factors driving this growth is the increasing awareness of the health benefits associated with consuming organic products. Studies show that consuming organic foods can significantly reduce exposure to synthetic pesticides and increase intake of beneficial compounds like antioxidants and essential nutrients, which are linked to lower chronic disease and cancer risks and better overall health. In Southeast Asia, Thailand has emerged as a regional leader in organic farming, with organic food sales growing at an annual rate of 7% from 2010 to 2014. Experts say this indicates that growth is possible, but only when consumer demand, market access, and government support are aligned. But in the Philippines, several structural barriers prevent the country from keeping pace. Alexandra Castillo, promotions coordinator and organic food development officer at Naturland e.V, shared with Rappler that the country’s biggest challenge lies in bridging the gap between consumer interest and actual access to organic food. “If we’re looking at market classes, the motivations are different. For the upper class, health is the main factor — they are more conscious of what goes into their bodies and tend to seek out healthier options. For everyday Filipinos, who have less purchasing power, what makes the most sense is the livelihood or social impact — knowing that farmers are fairly compensated and communities benefit,” she said. Consumers also associate organic products with safer production practices, but Castillo noted that many still struggle to find certified options. Access is limited, labeling is often unclear, and prices rise as products pass through multiple middlemen. She said that continued demand is crucial for supporting our farmers and the communities behind organic production. “It’s not just for me, but it’s for the people behind the actual food…. When we pray before meals, thank you for the people who made it. At least now, there’s context. Who is that person?” she said. Yet she emphasized that choosing organic is a form of care and responsibility that goes beyond health. “When they say organic, that means it’s without the buzzword of sustainable. It’s actually you choosing to care for yourself and you extending that empathy to the people that provide for you,” she said. Collaboration across the food system is essential to expanding organic agriculture in the Philippines. Consumers first need to demand organic products, which will urge retailers to broaden access. These retailers will then work closely with government agencies to effectively implement existing policies. Overall, farmers and advocates should take the lead. “There are policies now, but it’s not fully implemented, yet it gives a lot more gateway,” Castillo added. Education and awareness are also key in promoting organic agriculture, both for the consumer and our farmers. Castillo said worldwide organizations like Naturland e.V. play a key role in this movement. The group comprises over 128,000 farmers, fishers, beekeepers, and aquaculture producers in 61 countries, as well as 1,780 partners in processing and trade. Because limited market access remains one of the biggest obstacles for organic farmers in the Philippines, bigger organizations need to help boost both the production scale and marketing of these rural communities. In turn, this will also help lower prices, making organic food more accessible to Filipinos. Before buying anything that is labeled “organic”, consumers need to know first what makes something truly “organic,” especially since these products come at higher prices. According to Naturland e.V., organic farming is the only production system governed by government regulations across all major global markets, though standards vary by region. Certification requires farms to meet strict criteria and undergo regular monitoring, which contributes to higher production costs. Organic products do not use chemical pesticides or synthetic fertilizers, antibiotics are severely restricted, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are not allowed, and crops are rotated to maintain soil health. These practices make organic farming more labor-intensive and closely supervised compared to conventional agriculture; hence, the higher prices. Castillo explained that these requirements are designed to protect consumer health and preserve ecosystems, while also improving long-term farm resilience. Organic farming, she said, can offer healthier food options, reduce environmental impact, and strengthen agriculture’s ability to adapt to climate change. It also pays to take note of certification labels that identify legitimate organic products. In Europe, for example, the European Union’s (EU) organic logo ensures that EU rules on organic farming have been adhered to. Similar certification systems exist in other regions, though access to certified products remains uneven in the Philippines. The Department of Agriculture has also been promoting organic farming locally for its sustainability and food safety benefits. However, advocates say that wider access, clearer labeling, and stronger policy implementation are still needed for organic practices to take root nationwide. – Rappler.com Alfon Cabanilla is a Rappler intern studying AB Communication at Ateneo de Manila University.",True,true,Why is it challenging for the Philippines to adopt organic agriculture?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/naturland-philippines-organic-agriculture-farming-practices-challenges/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Retired air force general Romeo Poquiz was arrested upon landing at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) over a warrant of arrest from an inciting to sedition charge filed against him by the Philippine National Police (PNP). Poquiz’s lawyer Ferdinand Topacio was in the process of posting the P48,000 bail at the Quezon City Regional Trial Court when Rappler spoke to him past noon on Monday, January 5. Poquiz was arrested in NAIA past 8 am on Monday after arriving from a weeks-long family vacation in Thailand. “We just need his physical presence [in the court], I hope [he can be released within the day],” Topacio told Rappler over the phone. Poquiz is an outspoken critic of the Marcos administration, and is allied with groups supporting former president Rodrigo Duterte. He is a lead organizer of the September rallies against infrastructure corruption, but ones which were perceived to be politically motivated to elevate the Duterte bloc over Marcos. The rallies of their group, United People’s Initiative (UPI), was heavily scrutinized by both the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the local city government of Quezon City for alleged speeches that incite to sedition. The Quezon City government stopped the third day of the UPI rallies in November for alleged seditious tendencies. Poquiz’s name was also floated as one of the alleged instigators of a planned coup last November, but he has since clarified that his group spoke to AFP chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. “only to air our legitimate grievances,” and not to urge the military to withdraw its support for Marcos, he told One News on November 19. “I did not,” Poquiz said when asked if he specifically tried to convince Brawner to withdraw military support. But according to Poquiz’s lawyer, Levito Baligod, the complaint filed by the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) stemmed from a Facebook post, and not the UPI protests, nor the discussion with Brawner. The Facebook post, Baligod said, read: “Kailangan mag-seryoso ang gobyerno na mag-imbestiga sa anomalya dahil kung hindi, baka isipin ng mga tao na ang mastermind ay nasa Malacañang.” (The government needs to be serious in investigating the anomalies because if not, Filipinos might think that the mastermind is in Malacañang.) Rebellion and inciting to sedition complaints were filed, but only the latter charge progressed at the Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 77. The first hearing over the complaint was on October 15, and the warrant was issued way back December 5. Under Article 139 of the Revised Penal Code, sedition is “committed by persons who rise publicly and tumultuously in order to attain by force” actions that threaten government and social stability. “Inciting” under Article 142 is defined as “any person who, without taking any direct part in the crime of sedition, should incite others to the accomplishment of any of the acts which constitute sedition, by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, emblems, cartoons, banners, or other representations tending to the same end.” The Duterte administration also used this legal tool to go after critics. Staunch Duterte critic Antonio Trillanes IV was also charged of the same, and again this time, state prosecutors used the rule of “dangerous tendency.” In the Trillanes case, which he has since been cleared of, state prosecutors said there was dangerous tendency “when the words uttered or published could easily produce disaffection among the people and a state of feeling in them incompatible with a disposition to remain loyal to the government and obedient to the laws.” Ironically for Poquiz who is allied with pro-Duterte groups, state prosecutors also used the dangerous tendency rule against him. “The city prosecutor used an obsolete standard in evaluating whether the utterance incited or not [to sedition.] The city prosecutor used the old standard dangerous tendency, but there have been many Supreme Court decisions removing that standard, and we have a new standard called ‘clear and present danger’,” Baligod told Rappler. Clear and present danger, according to Supreme Court jurisprudence, has a two-way test: Duterte, during his presidency, cracked down on all kinds of dissent too, which for free speech advocates did not meet the clear and present danger standard. It’s not the first time that Marcos has used the same Duterte playbook against critics. Even protesters during his inauguration in 2022 were threatened with the same charges, and then again against the progressive bloc of protesters during the November 30 anti-corruption rally last year. Baligod said the charges were filed in court even though they had filed a motion for reconsideration (MR) before the Department of Justice (DOJ), which is still pending. Generally, prosecutors wait for the resolution of an MR to file charges in court, but the Duterte-time DOJ had often opted not to wait, too. – Rappler.com",True,true,Retired general arrested for inciting to sedition for Facebook post vs Marcos,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/retired-general-romeo-poquiz-arrested-inciting-sedition/,Rappler
"The lawmakers’ goal was to break Royina Garma. It took a subpoena, hours and hours of interpellations, and detention before she finally cracked. On Friday, October 10, Garma dropped a bombshell testimony — the gravest allegation against former president Rodrigo Duterte in so far as the quad committee conducting marathon hearings is concerned. Garma, who’s “very close” to Duterte, pinned him as the alleged mastermind of the bloody drug war that killed 30,000, going by the count of human rights advocates. In tears, Garma read her affidavit, narrating her knowledge about Duterte’s drug war. In May 2016, Garma said the then president-elect called her at 5 am, instructing her to meet him at his residence in Doña Luisa, Davao City. They had a meeting and Duterte instructed her to find a Philippine National Police (PNP) officer or an Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) operative capable of implementing on a national scale the war on drugs that was executed in his home turf. At first, Garma could not think of anyone that met Duterte’s criteria, until she remembered Edilberto Leonardo, her upperclassman from the PNP Academy — he was with the PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) and was an INC member. Garma mentioned Leonardo to Duterte, and on the same day, Senator Bong Go’s former Palace aide, Irmina “Muking” Espino, allegedly contacted Garma and requested Leonardo’s personal details. Through her former partner, cop Arthur Narsolis, Garma said she learned that Leonardo had been summoned by Duterte. Later, Garma said she was told by Leonardo that “he had prepared a proposal, routed through Bong Go, outlining the task force’s operations, which would encompass Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.” In other words, it would appear that based on Garma’s affidavit, Duterte tasked Leonardo, a member of PNPA Batch 1996, to implement a drug war plan, of which he (Leonardo) became head strategist. In her affidavit, Garma detailed how Duterte and Leonardo worked together to create the national anti-drug campaign. She said the plan was patterned after the “Davao model” that saw killings allegedly rewarded by Duterte. According to Garma, Duterte instructed Leonardo to organize a task force similar to the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF) to implement the campaign. The Davao Death Squad (DDS), according to the affidavit of DDS whistleblower Arturo Lascañas, was conceptualized in 1988, when Duterte was the mayor; it was known as an “anti-crime task force.” The task force eventually became the PAOCTF, which had a satellite office in Davao City headed by former PNP chief-turned-Senator Ronald dela Rosa. “Garma confirmed our belief from the very start that the drug war just replicated the DDS system that existed in Davao before 2016,” former senator Leila de Lima told Rappler. De Lima probed the killings under Duterte when she was Commission on Human Rights (CHR) chairperson. Garma, however, clarified that the creation of the task force did not push through. Instead, the police was mobilized for the national anti-drug campaign. She explained that the PNP CIDG Davao Region became the focal point of the operation. This makes sense as Leonardo, who was assigned to Manila at the time, was appointed Davao Region CIDG chief in June 2016 — the same month Duterte took the helm in Malacañang. “Leonardo conducted briefings for all PDEA (Philippine Drug Enforcement Group), IG (intelligence groups), Regional Directors, and PNP chiefs regarding operations,” Garma said in her affidavit. In the first three months of Leonardo’s assignment, Garma said she facilitated the meetings between him and Go, after which the two later established their direct communication. Garma said she was also informed by Leonardo that he picked “trusted personnel” to join the team. These included Lester Berganio, Rommel Bactat, Rodel Cerbo, Michael Palma, and Peter Parungo. Bactat, Cerbo, and Palma were dismissed cops, according to Garma. Parungo, meanwhile, was a former CIDG detainee accused of rape, while Berganio was a private citizen. Their assignments, according to Garma, who saw how they “operated,” were as follows: “Leonardo had the final authority to determine who would be included on the list of drug personalities and to classify their threat levels, as well as the discretion to remove individuals from the list,” Garma added. Go was involved in the operation as he was the one who did a weekly report and processed the requests for refunds under the system, according to Garma. Leonardo also reported all killings during police operations to Go. Garma also clarified that the quota system was not part of the original instruction, but became discretionary on the part of regional chiefs. Police could also volunteer to be part of the operation, according to Garma. The cops presented themselves if they were confident they coould get “the big fish in the area.” Among these volunteers, according to Garma, was Police Colonel Marvin Marcos, who led the operation inside the jail that killed Albuera, Leyte mayor Rolando Espinosa. Marcos confirmed volunteering but only for a position, and not to deliver kills in exchange for a reward. Rappler has reached out to Dela Rosa and Go for more recent comments. The two, who are now senators, had already denied Garma’s allegations earlier. Under the Davao template, there were at least three levels in the payment system: Kabataan Representative Raoul Manuel inquired about the payment per type of target, but Garma said she only knew of the payments’ range. “There were certain amounts given from what I understand, starting P20,000 to P1 million, but I am not familiar with the bracketing,” Garma explained in a mix of Filipino and English, adding that the P20,000-reward could possibly be allotted for street-level drug suspects since they were at the lowest “level.” The affidavit said rewards were given only for killings. Arrests merited from Leonardo only a COPLAN fund and a refund of the team’s operating expenses. All the money, according to Garma, were processed through Parungo’s bank accounts. Garma, in the hearing, also presented a matrix that showed Leonardo at the heart of the campaign. The then-CIDG Davao Region chief was involved both in the operations and reward system. The diagram also showed the PNP’s regional special operations groups, including the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. Garma said she would later learn that it was Muking Espino who sent the reward money for distribution to operatives. Garma’s testimony is an important piece of the puzzle in the probe into drug war killings. The new affidavit indirectly confirmed the systemic killings in Davao City. According to De Lima, among the vital points mentioned by Garma in her affidavit was Go’s alleged involvement in the so-called “national death squad” (NDS), referring to those involved in the drug war killings implemented nationwide. “Not once was Bong Go suspected to have an active role in the DDS. It was always Buenaventura and Lascañas then Duterte. But in the NDS, it appears that Leonardo and the “special task force” reported directly to Bong Go. That is one significant information that is not in the CHR findings due to lack of confirmation,” De Lima said. Garma’s revelations did not only reveal how Duterte came up with the drug war, but also showed that Leonardo was the bigger fish compared to her. In the Lascañas affidavit, Leonardo was only named as an alleged member, but did not include any specific detail about the supposed operation that Leonardo had joined. Garma’s affidavit finally showed the extent of Leonardo’s involvement in the drug war. Garma also corroborated the earlier statement of former drug war poster boy, Police Lieutenant Colonel Jovie Espenido, about the campaign having a reward system. Espenido claimed the rewards came from local government units, from the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office’s (PCSO’s) Small Town Lottery, and even from Philippine offshore gaming operators, and intelligence funds. (READ: ‘PNP is biggest crime group,’ says police colonel) However, Garma denied that the PCSO, which she once led, provided funds for the drug war’s reward system. Garma’s testimony also complemented Lascañas affidavit as the latter only included the alleged killings when Duterte was still mayor up to the time before he ran for president. The new affidavit shows the inception of the drug war when Duterte was already elected president and how the campaign was launched and operated. Can Garma’s testimony be used by the International Criminal Court that is conducting its own investigation into the drug war killings? For Kristina Conti of the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers and an ICC-accredited assistant to counsel, Garma can be tapped by the international court as witness and could further qualify as an insider witness during the trial. “Garma’s statement clearly identifies key actors in a policy that resulted in crimes against humanity. She brings critical evidence long sought by the ICC that establishes a systematic pattern to the ‘war on drugs,’ and connects the real, responsible perpetrators to the killings committed on the ground,” Conti told Rappler. Garma said no one coerced her to pin Duterte, saying that she realized the need to speak up after much reflection: “I made some reflections and I have to go back sa values na lagi kong sinasabi (that I always say)…. Always [tell] the truth because the truth will set you free.” As of now, Garma said she does not face any threats for executing her affidavit, but she acknowledged the influence and power of the people she implicated in the drug war. But despite all these, there’s a glaring detail in Garma’s revelation. In the hearing, she distanced herself from all the allegations, despite knowing the vital details of the drug war. Garma claimed that she refused to be part of the task force and did not know of any specific operation where she was ordered by a higher-up to kill. While she confirmed her knowledge of the killings and the reward system, Garma said she learned about the operations only from Leonardo. Her revelations did not erase the fact that she remains implicated in other alleged crimes, besides the bloody drug war. Garma is tagged in the killings of three Chinese drug lords in Davao in 2016, along with other officials like Duterte and Leonardo. She has also been implicated in the ambush of PCSO board secretary Wesley Barayuga, who was assassinated in 2020. On Friday, Garma said she received information about Barayuga’s alleged involvement in illegal drugs years ago and just relayed this to authorities for verification. She maintained that she did not have any beef with the slain PCSO official. An informed source, however, earlier told Rappler that there was an issue inside the PCSO involving both officials when they were still in the same agency. Garma was also previously questioned over her appointment to the PCSO and was accused of collecting millions of pesos from online gambling payola by former Cebu City mayor Tommy Osmeña. Garma was also the Cebu City police chief when the city became a hot spot of drug war killings. “Her testimony notwithstanding, Garma should be taken to account under domestic laws. Her actions in Cebu and as PCSO [general manager] should be investigated and prosecuted. She obviously needs to be more forthcoming with information about how the violence was carried out and who was paid with how much,” Human Rights Watch senior researcher Carlos Conde said. Quad committee co-chairperson Bienvenido Abante said Leonardo has already given feelers about giving his testimony. If this pushes through, people should await whether Leonardo’s testimony will contradict or corroborate Garma’s allegations against Duterte. But now that Garma has already spoken up, the former chief executive has been directly implicated, courtesy of the cop who was once “very close” to him. – Rappler.com *Some quotes were translated into English for brevity",True,true,How Duterte’s 5 am call to Garma starts a nationwide drug war,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/how-duterte-planned-drug-war-royina-garma-affidavit/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – If you’re a kayak touring company in the Philippines, what happens with decommissioned gear and kayaks that no longer serve their purpose? They go to waste — literally and figuratively. Grappling with this environmental footprint, a group of kayak touring guides from Bohol decided the life of these boats would not end there. In 2019, they talked about upcycling. In 2020, they launched Project Nova. First, Project Nova sought out local Bohol artisans. Without previous craft or design background, the organizers knew they couldn’t manufacture items like handcrafted bags and accessories themselves, so the goal was to collaborate on the production process. But the pandemic made them rethink their approach. “2020 gave us all the time to focus on this initiative as our kayak touring business shut,” Project Nova co-founder Rey Marcelo Donaire told Rappler. “Being a deeply community-based business here in Bohol, we decided to look inward.” With tourism temporarily shut down, they had time to learn new skills and explore creating upcycled products themselves. “Honestly, it was a bit of a learning curve! But this approach allowed us to build a sustainable business model that not only benefits the environment by giving these kayaks a new life, but also supports our local community,” Donaire said. Project Nova’s team also includes members from people’s organization ALIMANGA (Abatan Lincod Mangrove Growers Association), which manages 100 hectares of mangrove forest. This community traditionally made their living through fishing and harvesting nipa palms, which they weave into roof shingles. Project Nova started working with them as kayak tour guides in 2012. “Learning to kayak was easy for them. They’re already water people. Our challenge then was to develop them into proper, top-class kayak guides.” Initially, the kayak touring operations could only provide supplemental income since operations weren’t regular. But as they grew, the group was able to offer full-time work. “The goal is sustainable employment that doesn’t depend on tourism seasons or external factors — something they can rely on regardless of what’s happening in the broader economy,” Donaire said. Their traditional nipa weaving skills actually became useful when Project Nova pivoted in 2020. As they started handcrafting decommissioned inflatable kayaks into bags, “their craftsmanship skill lifted to another level.” How did the rest of the team learn to design and sew? “YouTube Uni was the teacher!” Donaire cheekily shared. They started from zero. In 2019, they scouted artisans who worked with leather or rubber materials, reasoning that kayak material — rubber-like — could be approached similarly to leatherwork. The first months of the 2020 lockdown were spent going down the rabbit hole of leather-crafting tutorials, bag-construction videos, and stitching techniques. The real challenge was adapting those methods for their specific kayak materials. “What that did was keep our staff employed and engaged when tourism businesses were shutting down left and right. Producing the bags ourselves gave us jobs and a way to make a living when everything else had stopped,” he said. There are tons of upcycling initiatives happening everywhere — from tarp bags, kite-sail designs, plastic-wrapper projects. They hadn’t come across anyone else doing kayaks, so this edge propelled Donaire to push through with his sustainable vision. “Using kayaks means we can pretty much upcycle any waste material. Imagination sets no limits. It’s changed how we think about resources altogether — instead of seeing discarded materials as trash, we see them as raw materials waiting for a new purpose. Once you shift that mindset, everything becomes possibility,” he said. Project Nova’s items look upcycled but brand-new; the haphazard feel embodies the gritty, rugged look of the brand that’s still stylish and purposeful: waterproof, sturdy, wearable for the modern and adventurous traveler. Sling bags provide convenience, card holders provide sleek usability, and tote bags combine wearability with durability. Colors can be muted, but some are bold — bright green for a sling bag, or dark gray and black for the tote. Project Nova’s creative process begins with imagination. They look at certain bag types and imagine whether it can be “Project Nova-ed.” Working as a group allows them to pick up individual strengths, quirks, and trademarks in the creative process. “We approach each piece, each bag model thinking: ‘How can this work for someone heading to the office and someone heading outdoors?’” “We aim for that sweet spot where urban functionality meets outdoor durability. It’s a bag you can walk into a meeting with, but it can absolutely handle getting soaked in a sudden downpour or being thrown around during travel,” he said. “It has a sleek look that’s ideal for daily use, but the waterproof kayak material and reinforced stitching mean they can handle whatever you throw at them. We’ve had patrons use them for everything from daily commutes to golf courses to multi-day travel.” Inflatable kayaks were chosen for the company because they’re packable and can be checked on flights. This made the business model easier, since they paddle different sites across islands and organize trips to remote provinces. However, like most inflatable gear, the adhesives that hold them together start deteriorating after 5-10 years. And because of harsh humidity and constant exposure to UV and saltwater from commercial operations, adhesive is always the first to go. “We rarely decommission kayaks because of material degradation. This particular kayak fabric is incredibly strong. It’s a semi-synthetic fabric welded between rubber layers. The company that makes it calls it a ‘green material’ because it has very little plastic content,” Donaire explained. They could actually last forever, he said, if not commercially used. The fabric is designed to be completely waterproof and incredibly durable; it has to withstand saltwater, UV rays, and physical stress from being dragged across rocks and sand. “When we transform them into bags, those same properties become exactly what you want in the Philippines’ unpredictably wet weather and harsh sun. The material is naturally weatherproof and tear-resistant,” he said. He shared that this process achieves “some level of circularity as a company” — they’re closing the loop on their equipment lifecycle instead of passing the waste problem to someone else or filling already overwhelmed landfills. Like most upcycling initiatives, “reverse engineering” is needed in the process. The complex, raw material sets the tone. It’s about first understanding its characteristics, then letting that guide design. The sourcing of discarded kayaks is easy, but breaking them down is one of the hardest parts of the process, Donaire shared. “We can’t just toss out the kayak and start cutting. We have to clean, disassemble, and carefully assess which parts work best for specific designs. Initially, we tried using any section, but over time we discovered which kayak parts work best for different bag styles or bag panels,” he explained. Every piece is hand-stitched from start to finish. They punch holes into the tough kayak material and carefully stitch it together. Hand-stitching is used, because machines are too costly and would displace some of their staff. Time and effort aside, this is what makes each piece distinct and unique. The brand is also considered cruelty-free, because they do not utilize any animal skin, hide, or by-products (like leather, tusks, gelatin, or beeswax) in production. The tides were rough for Project Nova’s pandemic beginnings. Donaire shared that he saw the strain of uncertainty showed on everyone’s faces when early challenges arose. But difficulty wasn’t new to them; the community weathered life together through the years. “The 2013 earthquake, Typhoon Yolanda, the Abu Sayyaf situation in Bohol in 2017. But 2020 felt different. The world felt like it was on a mad spin, and starting a new business added even more uncertainty,” Donaire said. “I totally understood when a few members bailed in the early days of hatching the plan.” Then Typhoon Rai hit. Bohol didn’t have power for nearly six months, but they were actually thankful they were making bags by hand. They could still work. The production studio became an escape from the chaos. And they weren’t just making bags during those weeks; they were making cement blocks to help fix community members’ homes. When everything settled and travel started again, they emerged with new bag models and merchandise for the kayak tours. But they realized relying solely on their kayak-tour customers wouldn’t be sustainable. That’s when they started looking into local product fairs in Manila, such as ArteFino Fair in Rockwell, Makati City. 2025 is their third year being part of the Philippines’ biggest artisanal fair, with a HeArteFino grant to match — a milestone that small businesses like Project Nova don’t take for granted. “In a way, being accepted into this space validates that we’re not just kayak guides no more,” he said. “The reception we received was honestly something we didn’t expect. Being part of this community pushed our standards to levels we never imagined reaching. I guess when you’re surrounded by incredible craftspeople and social enterprises, you naturally elevate your own game.” “In 2023, when we were the new kids on the block, I think we were more skeptical about ourselves than people were with us. There was definitely self-doubt and internal questioning — did we deserve to be here? Are we right to be in this space? Do our products really belong alongside these established brands?” They take every opportunity to learn and grow. They listen to comments and suggestions and use fairs as a platform to share their story. And over time, it’s never really gotten easy for them, but they’re up for it. The only thing they can do is prepare, make their bags better, do the work, and they know people will see it in the finished product. “I still have a hard time relating this growth to our community back home, because even they can’t believe that people actually buy our upcycled stuff. Since joining ArteFino, our bag models have more than doubled.” Project Nova describes itself as a fair-trade enterprise, with its impact on the community concrete. Aside from offering dignified wages (8-10% above the local minimum wage of Tagbilaran City) and job stability for their workers, Project Nova also creates programs that improve personal well-being: allocated hours during the workweek for fitness and exercise, free healthy lunches throughout the week, and incentive programs that give employees opportunities to travel outside the locality. This year, they started a team values formation program and financial literacy training. Project Nova’s monthly River ReBoot program supports their traditional livelihood as mangrove growers. They organize mangrove planting and river cleanups with various organizations across the province and region, helping maintain 105 hectares of mangrove forest. It has opened doors to school organizations, local civic groups and other advocacy groups like Plastic Free Bohol to get involved in conservation works. “In all aspects, this is true collaboration. We see the community as partners, not contract workers.” Now that Bohol is a UNESCO Global Geopark, any development needs to be guided by conservation and sustainability at its core. Development for the sake of development is never sustainable, Donaire said. “What we are advocating is economic growth that actually strengthens environmental protection rather than undermining it. When conservation becomes a viable source of income for local communities, they become the strongest guardians of their own ecosystems,” he said. As of now, Project Nova is mostly independent; they are not working with other LGUs yet aside from the local municipality for support. “We spend a lot of time on our rivers, coasts and islands. Some of them remote. We see how much beauty and diversity we have, and we also see how much trash we’ve dumped in these places where it shouldn’t be,” Donaire shared. Their work as kayak tour guides doesn’t stop on the water. With Project Nova, the impact they want to make has become bigger – it’s about shifting how people think about resources and community. “We’re proving that you don’t need to extract from your environment to make a living — you can build prosperity by protecting what you have,” Donaire said. “Be honest about your impact, take responsibility for your waste, and create opportunities that lift everyone up,” he added. Donaire doesn’t want Project Nova to just be a “brand” — he believes it should be a template and a movement. Most importantly, it is a mindset: “Your waste is your opportunity, your community is your strength, and your environment is your greatest asset.” Work with nature, instead of against it. “Let’s do this, one bag at a time,” he said. – Rappler.com",True,true,Boat to bag: How Project Nova turns discarded kayaks into sustainable gear,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/project-nova-upcycled-kayaks-sustainable-gear-bohol-philippines/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — Every ARMY knows the idol-favorite Korean gelato brand, Blue Polar, after K-pop global group BTS gave it a glowing recommendation. The shop originally opened in 2023 in Apgujeong, South Korea, an area known for its food and shops frequented by idols and celebrities. It quickly gained popularity among K-pop fans after restaurant Woo Hyang Woo served Blue Polar gelato during BTS Jungkook’s GOLDEN Listening Party. During the party, BTS Taehyung found himself especially attached to the affogato gelato. He told the owner, Hyun Jeong Kim, that if ARMYs went to the restaurant, he would pay for their gelato. True to his word, he paid for hundreds of gelatos in the span of five months. Apart from its iconic affogato, they also offer flavors of milk, sweet potato, matcha, and chocolate. The brand’s gelato is known for combining traditional gelato-making techniques with modern tastes. Since gaining popularity, ARMYs from all over the world have flown into Apgujeong just to try the iconic gelato — it became an online global sensation that quickly. Following high demand, the brand began expanding into different branches in Gwangyang and even New York City. It was BTS fan and businesswoman Catherine Cabalatungan who decided to bring Blue Polar to the Philippines for the first time. “It’s not an easy journey to be right here today, but then we are here already,” she shared at the brand launch this October in Poblacion, Makati City. But while fans are excited to dive into the different flavors, the important question remains: did the affogato live up to Taehyung’s hype? Frankly, yes. One fan described it as a “cozy little indulgence,” which combines sweet and creamy gelato with the boldness of espresso. Meanwhile, Blue Polar’s matcha gelato and its deeply earthy flavors blend seamlessly with the rich and velvety texture of gelato. The small cookie biscuit adds a small crunch that tops the experience. Now open in Poblacion, fans can try V’s beloved affogato, with the option to pair it with different coffees and drinks. — Alyana Fabella/Rappler.com Alyana Fabella is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the Ateneo de Manila University.",True,true,How Korean virality brought this gelato brand to Makati City,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/korean-virality-blue-polar-gelato-makati-city/,Rappler
"Just beyond Baguio’s borders, Itogon shelters Mt. Camisong, a mountain retreat experience that captures the essence of the Cordilleran culture in every detail. Launched last February, the park and events place had also unveiled their private dining hall: Alapaap, taking from the Tagalog word that means “cloud” or “the upper heavens.” True to its name, Alapaap lifts regional cuisine to new heights through thoughtful flavors and techniques, grounded in a shared sense of community and care for the environment. Mt. Camisong’s vice president for food and beverage, chef Stanley “Stan” Suva, stands at the helm of the kitchen, leading it with a deep respect for Cordilleran traditions and local ingredients. His background as an avid outdoorsman and his love for cooking over firewood on camping trips reveal themselves in Alapaap’s affinity for earthy, open-fire flavors. Though Kapampangan by heritage and raised in Manila, Suva’s approach to his “complex food” draws from his travels across the mountains such as in Kalinga and Besao. This exposed him to highland cooking methods such as smoking, fermentation, and foraging — traditions that now manifest thoughtfully across the menu. “All my dishes here have a Cordilleran touch,” Suva told Rappler — a philosophy that shines in Alapaap’s special menu curated for Baguio’s annual Ibagiw Festival, which celebrates local visual, musical, and culinary creativity. The curated menu, which is available to the public from November, features staples from their regular menu and bespoke dishes inspired by local artists Cara Bruno, Francis Alingcayon, and Michell Camolo. According to the chef, the Ibagiw 2025 menu is a testament that creativity has no boundaries. “It can be painted, sculpted, performed, or plated,” he said. “We hope that every meal reminds you that food, like art, can move the soul.” From the ambience down to the flavors, the menu offers a gastronomic experience that truly embodies what the Cordillera is all about. The first thing you’ll notice is that Alapaap was designed to blend in with the mountains. Down the slope of the park, you will be greeted by Mt. Camisong’s signature glass walkway and viewing deck that offers a panoramic view of the surrounding mountains. Tiers and stairs lead gently from the deck down to the dining area, which is seamlessly integrated with the pine forest. Inside, tall glass walls fill the space with natural light while framing the greenery of the Benguet highlands. The space also lets in the cool Benguet breeze, sans airconditioning. This sets up a meal that feels sophisticated and intimately connected to nature. Special Drink: Maharlika ng Alapaap – foraged grapes and apples Before the meal, they served a light refreshment with a soft pink hue. Called “Maharlika ng Alapaap,” it is made with foraged grapes and apples, topped with delicate cloud-like bubbles and a fruit garnish inspired by Michelle Camolo’s wire sculptures. The Maharlika offers a subtle and earthy taste, with a hanging wired fruit braid that melts into the drink to add a touch of natural sweetness. Notably, a strip of fruit leather made from dehydrated mango and pineapple peels added to its visual appeal, showcasing a resourceful use of leftover ingredients and the park’s commitment to zero-waste dining. Starter: Pagsibol – Kilawin in Bloom First on the menu was “Pagsibol – Kilawin in Bloom,” a vibrant starter that immediately awakens your senses. For this dish, fresh tuna is marinated in citrus, coconut milk, and bugnay vinegar — a local alternative that gives the dish a nuanced tang and sourness far beyond ordinary vinegar. Visually as striking as it is flavorful, the Kilawin was adorned by edible blooms and microgreens that felt reminiscent of a miniature meadow. Inspired by the floral elements in Cara Bruno’s paintings, the bright starter left a lasting impression that teases your appetite for the courses to follow. Main Course: Tadhana – Adobo and Pares smoked pork ribs The main course was a smoked pork ribs platter called “Tadhana” meaning “fateful meeting” in Tagalog. The dish offers the pairing of two beloved Filipino staples, adobo and pares, into what Suva dubs as “AdoRes.” The combination of the two sauces reflect the Ibagiw Festival’s convergence of fine arts and fine dining. Highlighting Suva’s signature smoky flavors, the meats were infused with depth, especially as the two sauces meet into a sweet, savory, and aromatic harmony. The mashed sweet potatoes provided a creamy counterpoint to the textures of the grilled and sautéed root vegetables, which felt like a dance on the palate. The AdoRes combination was a surprising hit, proving that marriage of popular Filipino flavors can elevate each other. Dessert: Walang Hanggan – Strawberry mascarpone In any trip to Baguio and its vicinity, strawberries are always a given. Alapaap celebrates them beautifully in a layered dessert called “Walang Hanggan,” taking inspiration from Francis Alingcayon’s surrealist and dream-like artworks. The final course offers sweet strawberry mascarpone mousse, freeze-dried strawberry flakes, and cotton candy that look like clouds, creating a whimsical presentation. The tiny merengues add a touch of “candied” crunch while the dessert itself strikes a perfect balance of sweetness to end the meal on a light and playful note. Overall, the filling course meal enjoyed with the backdrop of nature felt like a much-needed reset from the hustle and bustle of urban life. The full-course meal at Alapaap is priced at P2,400, good for two. Considering the value for the quality and freshness of the ingredients, the menu is already a bang for your buck compared to Metro Manila prices. Visitors should note, however, that Mt. Camisong charges an entrance fee, making it best to plan for the complete experience: All year round, Alapaap features different curated menus, with the Ibagiw Festival set available until December 15 only. Meanwhile, the restaurant will also be offering their Holiday Menu that features a noche buena-style meal including Seafood Bringhe, Roasted Chicken with Orange Watercress Salad, Ube Maja Blanca, among others. Mt. Camisong also offers multiple dining options outside of Alapaap, such as Marahuyo Café and the Muni-Muni Snack Bar, also conceptualized by Suva. These casual spots serve creative Filipino rice bowls with twists such as Tapa Pigar-pigar with stir fried cabbage and kangkong sambal and Pinangat na Tilapia. Visitors and diners will find that a meal at Mt. Camisong lets you experience the best of what Cordillera has to offer: food that celebrates its community, respects its environment, and reflects the artistry that continuously elevates it. – Rappler.com",True,true,"How Mt.

"MANILA, Philippines — It’s that time of year again — the holiday rush, the gift hunting, and the annual quest for the planner you’ll be facing 2026 with. Let’s be honest: planners only ever meet three fates: actually being used, being used halfway, then tucked safely in a drawer, or rewrapped as a “brand new” gift for someone else. Sounds bad? Maybe not. Most planners don’t make it to the first category simply because they weren’t built for the person using them. The right one isn’t always the most hyped in the market, but something that matches your pace, habits, and kind of productivity. So before you pick up another planner, here’s a quick look at which 2026 edition might actually work for you, based on your preferences. Now in its 23rd year, Starbucks continues its holiday tradition with the 2026 Traditions Collection. This season’s theme, “Invite Joy,” leans into the cozy, familiar warmth of the coffeehouse experience with art pages designed by local artists within the new planner. At the center of the lineup is the Siren Planner, with a more refined and functional upgrade. It comes in a small, handy leatherback format with siren-themed, embossed details on the front. Inside, the minimalist planner keeps things simple but organized: a monthly view, a monthly checklist, a weekly layout, plus freehand dotted pages you can use for journaling, habit-tracking, or brain dumps. Another new touch this year is the standalone leather holder — no longer attached to the planner itself — which makes it easier to slip your planner in and out and keeps it protected inside your bag. The pockets and sleeves inside are convenient to store your cards, files, documents, and photos in. Likely to use? If you’re not a Starbucks regular, the 18-sticker hunt might feel like more work. But if you already have a caffeinated routine going, this could be an extra treat. For those looking for local, vibrant stationery, Limelight’s 2026 collection has new colorful options. The 365 Days, 365 Stories: The Unwritten Travels edition spices up planning with a little adventure.

"MANILA, Philippines – The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) slashed the country’s key interest rate to 4.5% on Thursday, December 11, amid a faster inflation forecast and weaker outlook on economic growth. BSP Governor Eli Remolona Jr. noted that the monetary authority has shed 2% off the policy rate since August 2024. “The cut will revive economic activity a bit at a time when painful governance issues around infrastructure investments have weakened government spending, business confidence, and domestic demand,” he said. Interest rates are one of many tools a central bank can use to control inflation. A lower interest rate means cheaper borrowing costs, encouraging people to spend more and stimulate the economy. Although the central bank downgraded its 2025 inflation forecast to 1.6%, it hiked its inflation outlook for 2026 and 2027 to 3.2% and 3%, respectively. Remolona noted that business and consumer confidence remains tepid amid ongoing investigations into alleged corruption in public works and within the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Because of this, the BSP expects the economy to recover only by the second half of 2026. “I think the main factor would still be the governance issue. [When] investors and consumers feel that those issues are being addressed, then we should see some recovery,” he explained. The Philippine economy grew only 4% in the third quarter — the lowest since the COVID-19 pandemic — as government infrastructure spending plunged to a 14-year low due to the flood control scandal. While reforms in fiscal policy or the use of taxation and spending to manage an economy would still play a bigger role in resolving governance issues, Remolona said monetary policy can compensate for the negative effects brought by weak consumer and business sentiment. With the latest rate cut, the BSP said it may be nearing the end of its easing cycle. Moving forward, additional rate cuts may be limited and will assess the impact of previous reductions on the economy. Remolona said it may take one to two years before the economy feels the full effect of the rate cuts. “We also hope that government infrastructure spending will return to normal levels and be more effective with reduced leakages, and that investor sentiment and consumer sentiment will improve,” he said. – Rappler.com",True,true,Bangko Sentral cuts policy rate as ‘painful’ corruption woes mute growth outlook,https://www.rappler.com/business/bangko-sentral-pilipinas-monetary-policy-interest-rates-december-2025/,Rappler
"BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – The Mile Hi Group has asked Malacañang to review the procedures that led to the closure of its outlets inside Camp John Hay, saying the enforcement of Cease and Desist Orders (CDOs) on November 3, 2025 left “no prior notice or opportunity to cure any alleged deficiencies,” based on its official statement dated November 28. The group said its appeal is anchored on “documented timelines and official communications” it previously submitted to authorities. A September 5, 2025 letter from JHMC president and CEO Manjit T. Singh Reandi confirmed that Mile Hi’s leases at the Mile Hi Complex were extended “until January 5, 2026,” while expansion proposals remained under review. This followed an August 28 letter from proponent Luigi Nuñez requesting continued collaboration and lease extension. This written extension stands in contrast to later public statements that the tenants were operating without a subsisting lease. In its statement, the Mile Hi Group said it had invested in bringing activity back to long-unused portions of the Mile Hi Complex under the June–August 2025 lease, subsequently extended by JHMC. It added that it raised billing and utility questions in letters sent on September 6, September 24, and October 28 — among them a water charge exceeding ₱182,000 for three months, far higher than the reported averages of other outlets. Despite these unresolved issues, the group said it delivered checks on November 14 “to cover the full amount of the outstanding billing,” but JHMC staff did not accept the payment due to internal approval procedures. According to the Mile Hi Group, the CDOs were dated October 30 and served on November 3, about an hour after one of the owners visited the JHMC office to discuss billing concerns. The orders were implemented immediately, halting operations at all outlets. It also noted that Final Demand and Notice to Vacate letters, typically issued before closures, were dated November 17 and served on November 18, more than two weeks after the shutdown. The group said the sequence was included in its statement “solely to complete the factual timeline.” A separate November 6 letter from JHMC building official Engineer Bobby Akia revoked the Authority to Operate for In-Bento, Hay&Co, and Mile Hi Diner. The letter cited expired lease agreements, continued operations after their lapse, accumulated lease and Common Use Service Area (CUSA) obligations, utility arrears, and items listed in an October 23 Notice of Violation. It also said the Office of the Building Official (OBO) would recommend cancellation of the outlets’ business permits by the Baguio City Government. The group said more than 30 employees have been unable to work since the closures and estimated losses at around ₱3.8 million from non-operations, cancelled bookings, and spoilage. On November 25, Nuñez submitted an administrative complaint to the Office of the Deputy Executive Secretary for Legal Affairs, accusing Reandi of abuse of authority, oppression, retaliation, harassment, gross violation of due process, defiance of the BCDA Board, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. Nuñez wrote that the complaint stemmed from the “simultaneous Cease-and-Desist Orders issued without due process on November 3, 2025” and affirmed that its contents were based on his personal knowledge and official records. Reandi, in an interview with the media on December 5, Friday, said JHMC acted within normal procedures and stressed that the tenants’ contract had ended. He said the outlets were allowed to operate temporarily “under the tolerance of the management” to support economic activity but maintained that collection efforts must be fair to other tenants who pay regularly. He added that JHMC had documentation of attempts to reach the locators and said that when obligations are “due and demandable,” agencies cannot override Commission on Audit (COA) rules. He also said tenants issued CDOs for non-payment should approach the imposing agency for guidance. “Ayaw din naman namin na magsarado, kaso gusto namin fair,” Reandi said. (We also don’t want them to close, but we want fairness.) In its statement, the Mile Hi Group said it respects “all lawful processes” and is seeking clarification to ensure it is given a fair chance to comply. It emphasized that its release “is not intended to make allegations of wrongdoing,” but to inform stakeholders of its status and request for review. Malacañang has yet to announce the status of the review request or the administrative complaint. – Rappler.com",True,true,Mile Hi Group seeks Palace review of Camp John Hay closures,https://www.rappler.com/business/mile-hi-group-seeks-palace-review-camp-john-hay-closures/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – For the longest time, fan art has been an essential part of fandom culture. Whether it’s something as small as anime characters reimagined as Hogwarts students from the Harry Potter universe, or something as big as crucial Marvel superheroes brought back to life in Avengers: Endgame, fan art is a medium pursued by fans who pour their love and admiration into the media they consume. In the era of the internet and advanced technology, fan art has been shared digitally. These online spaces have become avenues for fans to express themselves with fellow fans and creators alike — from commissioning artworks and entering art contests to joining art challenges on social media and more. In 2022, artists Adriann Delmo and Jireh Villafuerte (aka Kyouzins) were two of five winners in Talenthouse’s Morbius global fan art competition, where their artworks were featured as promotional posters for the Philippine premiere. Much like traditional museums and art galleries that we visit, fan art now acts as its own modernized iteration — a space where fans can celebrate the original media while creating new media for others to enjoy and share. Given the wide scope of audiences and enthusiasts all over the world, fanart has become the internet’s version of a local museum. Rather than having art displayed in big-time galleries, these artists turn to social media to share their creativity and imagination with others. Websites like X, Instagram, and Tumblr serve as 24/7-access galleries where anyone can view and share works. These “galleries” are updated in real time, reflecting not just the artists’ imagination but also current trends and emotional responses in fiction. A simple drawing can start conversations among fans, giving them more opportunities to share ideas and excitement over their favorite characters and stories. It doesn’t necessarily have to relate to the plot of the media — it can also be reimagined in different “universes.” back on my hq!svt agenda! only this time it's the other way around 🤩 pic.twitter.com/oGyqDhZsED An example of fan art being used for reimagining is seen in Filipino artist mangobursts’ artwork posted on X in December 2020. In the post, members of the K-pop group Seventeen are drawn wearing jerseys and positions from the different teams of the popular volleyball anime Haikyuu!! “Back on my SEVENTEEN agenda! [O]nly this time it’s the other way around,” they wrote in the post, referencing an earlier fan art depicting Haikyuu!! characters as members of the K-pop group in a video. svt!hq drawover with msby+adlers+ejp+frogs 🥰💜✨ pic.twitter.com/Wy8Bn712J6 Today, where everything has a price, people have turned to fan art as a means of livelihood. Although social media allows artists to show their work for free, it also attracts potential customers who may want to commission personalized pieces. Artists open slots for commissions, drawing different characters or ship pairings for a price. The rate depends on the complexity of the artwork and the time it takes to complete. They usually sell their art through platforms like Etsy, RedBubble, or even their own websites to verify ownership and authenticity. Filipino artist Art of Neight has built a following of over 200,000 combined on X and Instagram as of writing. Known for his art inspired by the 2013 post-apocalyptic anime Attack on Titan, he sells his works through Inprnt and the tiered subscription service Patreon. In August, he was invited to a booth at the Komiket convention at Ayala Malls Manila Bay, featuring his art from Attack on Titan as well as pieces based on Netflix originals Arcane and K-Pop Demon Hunters. As the use artificial intelligence grows across creative and academic spaces, artists are now struggling with the problem art theft — their art stolen without their consent — for use in AI generation processes. AI websites rely on the input of information to generate text, images, and videos. This often includes countless artworks publicly posted online, leaving artists frustrated over the unauthorized use of their creations. The use of AI-generated imagery diminishes the time and effort human artists invest in their craft. From conceptualizing to polishing, human hands and minds are behind every authentic piece. To push back against generative AI, many artists now add watermarks to their works and post disclaimers on their profiles and captions. Just as art institutions grapple with plagiarism, theft, and uncredited acknowledgment, fan art communities face the same challenges today — intensified by the rise of AI and websites like ChatGPT. Each piece means something to its creator — whether it was drawn in minutes or over a month — and it can never replace the emotional factor that only human artists can convey. In this way, fan art in online communities mirrors local museums and galleries, not just in showcasing skill but in protecting creative ownership as well. – Rappler.com Juliana Chloe Gonzales is a Rappler intern studying AB Communication Arts at the De La Salle University.",True,true,‘Fan art’ as fine arts: The modernized ‘galleries’ for fandom spaces,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/fan-art-modernized-galleries-fandom-spaces/,Rappler
"The Philippines’ widening flood-control corruption scandal — triggered by arrest warrants against former congressman Zaldy Co and senior Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) officials — has morphed into a systemic governance crisis that now implicates key figures across the legislative, political, and bureaucratic landscape. What began as a ₱289-million procurement anomaly has expanded into a broader indictment of the country’s fiscal-governance architecture, its opaque budget process, and the political economy that enable leakages in public-works spending. For global investors evaluating sovereign risk, the issue is no longer whether Zaldy Co would be arrested. It is now more of the structural configuration of governance failure — where policy architects, political brokers, contracting beneficiaries, and bureaucratic enablers appear entangled in one convergent breach of fiscal integrity. The addition of legislators to the constellation of bureaucrats linked to the scandal elevates the risk profile further. For markets, this signals not just individual misconduct but institutional permissiveness that corrodes public-expenditure predictability, procurement fairness, and long-horizon investment certainty. The scandal unfolds in the middle of the country’s infrastructure super-cycle — a critical phase under the Marcos Jr. administration’s “Build Better More” agenda, supported by multilateral lenders, bilateral financing, and increasing private-sector participation through hybrid Public-Private Partnership (PPP) models. Flood-control and DPWH spending have historically been hotspots for budget leakages, cost inflation, and execution failures. This scandal exposes structural weaknesses across three core governance risk pillars: 1. Fiscal Governance Alleged 2025 budget manipulation by senators Francis “Chiz” Escudero (specifically when he was Senate president), Joel Villanueva, and Jinggoy Estrada strikes at the credibility of fiscal planning — a key metric monitored by credit-rating agencies. 2. Procurement Integrity Zaldy Co’s dual posture as policymaker and contractor underscores the risks of embedded conflicts of interest and rigged procurement pathways. 3. Institutional Coordination DPWH regional involvement suggests systemic vulnerabilities inside a bureaucracy where flaunted political influence overrides prudent technical decision-making. For investors, these failures translate into higher cost of capital, longer project gestation, and elevated execution risk, particularly across infrastructure, the Philippines’ supposed growth engine. Global markets differentiate isolated corruption cases from structural governance breakdowns. The current scandal clearly falls into the latter category. Below is a governance-risk map showing how each implicated actor contributes to systemic vulnerability. Zaldy Co – Operational and contractual liability His case reflects the entrenched political-business networks that compromise the integrity of public procurement. Chiz Escudero – Policy-level liability Note: Markets assign significant weight to Escudero’s role because budget reliability is foundational to sovereign-risk evaluations. Joel Villanueva – Allocation and influence liability Note: This raises red flags on discretionary project allocation and political interference in appropriations. Jinggoy Estrada – Political-broker liability and pattern-risk amplifier While not yet the central political node, Estrada’s inclusion significantly escalates risk signals, for three reasons: Note: For foreign capital, Estrada’s emergence is not about personal guilt — it is about what it signals: that budget manipulation may be broader, more coordinated, and more institutionally embedded than initially assumed. The crisis now spans: This is the type of triangulated + political-broker failure pattern which I categorize as institutional weakness in sovereign-risk assessments. 1. Sovereign credit rating outlook A scandal implicating multiple senators and DPWH officials weakens the Philippines’ institutional-strength score and may introduce negative outlook bias if no systemic reforms are introduced. 2. Foreign direct investment hesitation Investors from Japan, Singapore, and the Middle East — major players in Philippine infrastructure — place heavy emphasis on transparent procurement. A scandal of this breadth may increase due-diligence cost and elevate required Interest Rate Risk (IRR). 3. PPP pipeline vulnerability Developers may demand risk premiums or defer participation altogether, weakening infrastructure rollout targets for PPPs. 4. Peso and bond market volatility Perceived political-governance risk can push up local bond spreads and increase currency volatility. 5. Infrastructure execution drag Investigations into DPWH offices and congressional participation can stall or halt regional flood-control and transport projects — directly affecting the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). From a global-investor perspective, the case now implicates: This is no longer a mere procurement scandal. It is a multi-faceted, governance-risk event with direct implications for sovereign creditworthiness, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, PPP viability, and long-term infrastructure performance. The arrest warrants issued against Co are not closure. They are evidence of structural vulnerabilities that require institutional reform, not cosmetic enforcement. Until the investigative lens expands beyond DPWH intermediaries and contractor-linked lawmakers, foreign investors will continue pricing the Philippines as a high political-governance-risk market, particularly in infrastructure, sovereign bonds, and other long-horizon assets. Below is a Rating-Agency Style Risk Matrix which Vantage Point tailored in the mold of sovereign analysts, institutional investors, and credit-rating committees. Here, I followed the structure typically used by Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch — categorizing risks into Institutional, Fiscal, Political, and Execution buckets, assigning severity levels, likelihood assessments, and potential rating implications RATING-AGENCY STYLE RISK MATRIX Philippines: Flood-Control Corruption Scandal – Governance & Sovereign Risk Assessment 1. Institutional Governance Risk 2. Fiscal Governance Risk 3. Political Stability & Policy Continuity Risk 4. Execution, Infrastructure & Procurement Risk OVERALL RISK SCORE (Rating-Agency Model) The multi-node liability indicates deep structural weaknesses in budget integrity, procurement governance, and institutional accountability. For foreign investors, the lesson is clear: The flood control scandal should be interpreted as evidence of a governance system that requires structural reform. Until the investigative focus expands beyond Co to include policy-level actors, investors will continue to price in elevated political-governance risk, particularly in infrastructure-linked asset classes and long-horizon capital deployments. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] Why global investors see PH flood control scandal as systemic red flag,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-global-investors-see-flood-control-corruption-philippines-red-flag/,Rappler

"When COVID arrived early in 2020, pandemic restrictions made in-person mental health care difficult or impossible. Both therapists and patients had to adapt almost overnight. For many in the field, it felt like a gamble: could this screen-based format offer the same level of support for people struggling with depression, anxiety or trauma? Evidence has been growing, but until now few studies have compared treatment outcomes before and during the pandemic. Research my colleagues and I conducted offers new insights into this period. We followed 2,300 patients treated in Sweden’s public mental health system over six years — three years before and three years during the pandemic — and tracked outcomes for common conditions including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We found that nearly half of visits shifted online during the pandemic (up from just 4% pre-COVID), yet treatment outcomes did not decline — they remained stable, despite the rapid transition. We aren’t certain why remote care works, but one reason might be that the most important aspects of good therapy — things like building trust between patient and therapist, using evidence-based treatments and regular follow-up — can still occur online. In fact, for some people, meeting by video can make it easier to show up and feel comfortable. Our study suggests that, when care is done well, whether it’s in person or online doesn’t make much difference. Online care also helps with everyday difficulties. It’s often easier for people who live far away, have trouble getting around or have busy schedules to get help from home. And during a health crisis like the pandemic, being able to keep up with treatment probably helped many people stay on track instead of falling behind. Still, the findings come with limits. The study did not include children, people in acute psychiatric crisis or those with severe psychotic disorders — groups for whom in-person care may still be essential. And while online therapy offers flexibility, it also requires access to a private space, stable internet and the ability to engage through a screen — conditions that aren’t guaranteed for all patients. Just turning on a webcam isn’t enough. The clinics in this study followed proven treatment methods and kept a close eye on how patients were doing. These steps probably made a big difference and are important for making remote care work. Rather than being a temporary fix, online mental health care has become a core part of the system. Our study offers strong evidence that remote care, when well implemented, can match in-person treatment in effectiveness, even during something as challenging as a pandemic. There is no one-size-fits-all model — and not all patients will benefit equally from internet-based treatments. But giving people the choice — and maintaining high standards of care regardless of delivery method — appears to be a key to success. Because in the end, what matters most isn’t where care happens. It’s that it happens and that it works. – Rappler.com Fabian Lenhard is a researcher at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet.

"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Tourism (DOT) and TikTok Philippines on Tuesday, October 21, signed a memorandum of agreement to help micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) promote their goods and services on the social media platform. The DOT and TikTok Philippines’ collaboration entails training DOT-accredited vendors on short-form video content creation and online marketing through a series of workshops nationwide. The collaboration will target MSMEs such as small hotels, travel agencies, souvenir shops, and tourism groups. DOT Secretary Christina Frasco said the first training camp will be held through a one-day hybrid setup in November for 50 MSMEs in Metro Manila and Cebu. Frasco, who hails from Cebu, said the province’s tourism sector had been devastated by the recent earthquakes that devastated Bogo City and the province’s other northern areas. The tourism chief added that the end goal of the DOT’s partnership with TikTok is to increase the revenues and market penetration of MSMEs in the sector, which she hopes will translate into more tourist arrivals. The Philippines logged 2.9 million arrivals in the first half of 2025, and the tourism sector is expected to contribute P2.7 trillion to the Philippine economy this year.

"MANILA, Philippines – Apart from running, hiking has become quite a trend nowadays to stay active. Many are being encouraged to explore the beautiful mountains in the country, whether you’re treating yourself on a solo date by trying out a new hobby, moving on from a situationship, joining the active lifestyle trend, or simply wanting to see the scenic views of mother nature. It won’t matter if you’re only a solo goer joining a group, or you’re a couple or a barkada (group of friends) wanting to create lasting memories and test your bond. There are also many groups in the hiking community that you can be part of by browsing online, especially on Facebook groups like Philippine Group of Mountaineers and Akyat Bundok. Just a friendly reminder: make sure to verify the accounts you’re communicating with. But before you perch the summit that is perfect for beginners like you, let’s first get familiar with a few terms and concepts that will guide you on your climb. First is the term “mother mountain,” which refers to the first mountain a person has hiked. Your mother mountain might influence your desire to try other mountains or continue your mountaineering journey, which is why choosing the mountain that matches your energy as a first-timer is a must. Next is the “summit” — a common term for hikers that refers to the peak of the mountain. Every hiker’s ultimate goal is to reach the summit, where the effort pays off with the majestic view from above. Prior to your arrival at the summit, you first have to walk on the path leading up the mountain, which is also called a “trail.” Trails vary: some are open with fewer trees, others are muddy and slippery, and some have steep sections, or the “assault” portions that require extra effort. To guide the joiners, trails are categorized into five trail classes. Class 1 is the easiest that usually requires no technical skills since the terrain is easy to navigate. As the class number goes up, more technical skills are needed. Aside from the trail class, it’s also important to be aware of the difficulty scale, with 1 being the easiest to 9 being the most difficult. If you’re wondering why it’s not 5 or 10, the scale was recommended by Pinoy Mountaineer around 2007. Difficulty scale measures how steep the trail is based on its trail class, duration of the hike, and whether you may need more technical skills like using ropes. Now that you’re familiar with the basics, it’s time to choose where to go with this list of beginner-friendly mountains that could be your very own mother mountain! Just one bus ride away from Manila, you can instantly start your hiking journey at Mt. Batulao in Nasugbu, Batangas, and appreciate its scenic beauty. Its trail class of 3 lets you experience different types of trails, both easy and challenging, with a 4/9 difficulty level where you can start learning how to maneuver your steps and position yourself. With proper body conditioning like walking or running prior to the hike, you can summit this mountain in about two to four hours. Mt. Batulao has a new trail that is mostly flat yet slanted, making it suitable for beginners. This is also ideal for those who are still new to high-altitude views or are quite scared of heights and anything too daring. Its old trail, on the other hand, has rappelling sections since there are steep cliffs and the views can be much more dizzying. Did you know that some parts of singer Aicelle Santos’ “Kapangyarihan ng Pag-ibig” music video were also shot on this mountain? Among the top list of the easiest mountains to climb in the Philippines, with a 2/9 difficulty level, is Mt. Kulis in Tanay, Rizal. This mountain has no age limit. You can bring anyone along, whether a kid, an elderly mountaineer, or even your four-legged friend. Everyone is welcome to climb with no restrictions! Since the hike does not heavily focus on endurance, all you need is a light and comfortable day-hike bag, and your readiness to traverse the three-kilometer trail. A post shared by Dylan Menor (@menordylan_) Because of how manageable it is, expect plenty of hikers visiting Mt. Kulis, especially on weekends. To avoid big crowds and enjoy the best photo spots, it’s best to head out early since it will only take about one to two hours to complete the hike. This is singer Zephanie’s mother mountain, and with its beginner-friendly trail, it might also become yours! A post shared by Zephanie (@zephanie) They say that If you conquer this mountain on your first hike, then nothing should scare you to climb more. While some would argue that this isn’t the easiest mountain choice for beginners, Mt. Daraitan is perfect for those beginning their hiking journeys but already have an active lifestyle. Located in Tanay, Rizal, Mt. Daraitan is part of the ever-strong Sierra Madre mountain range. Coming with a bit of challenge but still doable for beginners, it has a trail class that ranges from 1-3 (Class 1: walking, Class 2: hiking on rugged terrain, Class 3: scrambling with hands for balance, as noted by Pinoy Mountaineer). Travel light as you will encounter a mix of rocky and muddy trails, which makes the mountain extra challenging during the rainy season. Go heel first when going down to be safer in case you slip! Bring a first-aid kit just in case you get scratched by rocks during your hike. Since it usually rains in the area, you may also want to pack clothes that are easy to dry — such as those made with synthetic fibers like nylon or polyester. If you’re planning an early morning hike, bring a flashlight or headlamp to help you navigate the dark more easily. And of course, don’t forget to do some stretching and active resting prior to your hike. It usually takes about three to five hours to reach the summit of Mt. Daraitan. It may be a bit long and tiring for newbies, but once you get there, you’ll realize that it’s totally worth the climb with its breathtaking view. Seal your Mt. Daraitan experience by swimming at its cave in Tinipak River. It’s where you can enjoy the river’s cold water and appreciate the mountain’s rock formations. Ben&Ben band members and couple Pat Lasaten and Agnes Reoma hiked this mountain in 2024. Most know this mountain as the shooting location of Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral. But Mt. Balagbag offers much more than that. This mountain from Rodriguez, Rizal can be your family’s next getaway. It’s even senior-citizen approved, and you can bring your 4×4 vehicles for camping. With a difficulty level of 3/9 and a trail class of 1 to 2, this mountain does not pose steep challenges. Mt. Balagbag can be hiked for a total of five hours, and throughout your trail, you will be able tosee some waterfalls and rivers. Since it is an open trail with minimal tree cover, it is advisable to wear breathable clothes and schedule your trek early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the scorching sun. Once you reach the peak, Mt. Balagbag’s elevation offers a view of Ortigas and some parts of Metro Manila. Even before the hiking trend grew, Kapamilya star Erich Gonzales hiked Mt. Balagbag in 2018, with her co-star Janella Salvador, describing it as her “happy place.” A post shared by Erich Gonzales (@erichgg) Another open trail on the list is Mt. Mariglem in Cabangan, Zambales. Opened in 2023, Mt. Mariglem instantly attracted hikers with its beautiful scenery featuring the view of the area’s coastline and mountain peaks and even a glimpse of the West Philippine Sea. This minor climb only takes two to three hours to reach the summit, with trail class of 1-3. While generally manageable, the trail includes several assaults, particularly on steep and rocky descents. Still, the trail itself is enjoyable and straightforward. Although the main challenge here is the heat. Hikers recommend that it’s best to reach Mt. Mariglem’s summit by sunrise. Bring lots of water, plus essentials like a fan, umbrella, or cap to protect yourself from the sun. Expect your footwear to get wet during river crossings, as most rivers are found near the jump-off point. Apart from the river swim, another adventure that hikers enjoy here is cliff jumping. Social media influencer Kimpoy Feliciano posted a vlog documenting his hike up Mt. Mariglem. Despite the evident heat in the video, the vlogger said the breeze felt refreshing and advised starting early to avoid the intense sun. Who would have thought that the highest mountain in Luzon could be part of this beginner-friendly list? It will only take about four to six hours to hike to perch the summit of Mt. Pulag with a trail class of 1-2 with a 3/9 difficulty level. Located in Benguet, Mt. Pulag is a favorite spot visited by hikers because of its breathtaking glory, most especially the sunrise above the thick sea of clouds during sunny weather. Apart from its view, it was also the previous home of Pugal, the online sensation cat that went viral earlier this year. Pugal conquered this mountain as it joined the mountaineers and guided them on the trails. Through the Ambangeg Trail, which is considered a minor hike, the climb does not require much technical skill or prior hiking experience. Assault sections are present but they are relatively mild. The distance from the jump-off point to Pulag’s summit is about eight kilometers, so you should be prepared for a long walk. As you ascend, expect colder temperatures, thinner air, and stronger winds. With the mountain’s landscape as your backdrop, you’ll definitely want to curate your picture-perfect outfit. Better choose one that keeps you warm yet comfortable enough for the long walk ahead. Roadtrip (2024) was shot in Mt. Pulag, telling the story of four friends on a hiking journey together. Actress and writer of the film Candy Pangilinan shared a vlog about their trek to the filming spots. Pangilinan repeatedly mentioned how cold it was throughout their adventure. While the actress found the hike challenging, she still expressed her appreciation for Mt. Pulag’s beauty. Although not a mountain, Aw Asen Falls still deserves a spot on the list! Because of its picturesque view, it has also become a popular destination among climbing enthusiasts. The hike to the falls takes only about two to three hours, with a 4/9 difficulty level and a trail class of 1-2. Aw-Asen’s trail is steep with very few flat sessions, so expect both uphill and downhill paths. While some sections of it are already paved, most of the way to the falls is made up of stairs, which makes it beginner-friendly. A light pack for hiking and swimming is recommended. The best part of this climb is that you will be greeted by the majestic view of the falls that surely inspire you to explore more mountains and waterfalls. After all, it is the highest falls in the Ilocos Region. This waterfall was featured in Biyahe ni Drew’s episode last July, where Drew Arellano talked about why it attracts hikers and how to get there. “Kahit na walang filter yung mata, ang ganda visually,” Arellano said, referring to how the falls look stunning up close compared to the photos posted on social media. (Even though the eyes have no filters, Aw-Asen Falls still looks beautiful visually.) – Rappler.com Alessandria Corral is a Rappler intern and a Bachelor of Arts in Speech Communication student at the University of the Philippines Diliman.",True,true,"Tara, bundok!

"MANILA, Philippines – With the mention of the Michelin Guide, many stop to wonder: Michelin, as in, the tires of my car? Are they the same thing? The short answer: yes. But how did a tire company end up creating what would become the holy grail of fine-dining recommendations and value-for-money food spots? Chefs around the world clamor for the renowned distinction, with diners relying on its selections and even planning their travel itineraries around them. The Michelin Guide today stands as part marketing genius, part cultural accident — an unlikely evolution that began over a century ago, founded on the need to simply sell more tires. In Clermont-Ferrand, France, brothers André and Édouard Michelin inherited a family business owned by their maternal grandfather in 1832 that made agricultural tools and rubber goods like hoses and belts. In 1889, they officially founded Michelin as a tire company. But how did the iconic Michelin mascot come to be? The brothers saw many tires stacked on top of each other and thought it resembled a man. Why not use that figure to advertise their products? The man named Bibendum — aka the adorable Michelin Man — was born, and is now one of the world’s oldest trademarks. As motoring began to infiltrate French life, the brothers faced a marketing problem: there were very few cars on the road, and drivers weren’t taking long trips that wore out tires. But they had a vision for the French automobile industry at a time when there were fewer than 3,000 cars in the country. They published a little handbook for motorists in 1900 that included maps, tire-repair tips, where to find petrol, and yes, places to eat and sleep. That first edition — with 35,000 copies — was distributed free. But one day, André Michelin walked into a tire shop and found copies of the guide being used as workbench props. The brothers realized: people value what they pay for. That line — “man only truly respects what he pays for” — is repeated in Michelin’s own history and is behind the decision in 1920 to stop giving the guide away and start charging for it. By the early 1900s, Michelin began expanding its reach beyond France, releasing guides for nearby territories, including Belgium, Algeria, Tunisia, as well as the Alps and Rhine regions. As mobility grew, so did the guide. In 1920, Michelin shifted from a free handbook to a paid publication, removing advertising and expanding its restaurant listings. The guide went toward a more professional, curated approach. By 1926, the guide introduced its first star to mark “fine dining” establishments. Five years later, in 1931, Michelin formalized the multi-star hierarchy still used today — one, two, and three stars — and standardized the red cover that would become the main pillar of the guide’s identity. After staying mostly European for decades, New York issued the first major US edition in 2005. In 2007, Tokyo became Michelin’s first foray into Asia, helping Tokyo become the city with the most three-star restaurants in the world. In 2016, Singapore became the first Southeast Asian country to get its own Michelin Guide. The pandemic shifted things for the guide, with printed global editions ending in 2021. The Michelin Guide can now be found on digital platforms, its website, and an app. After its 125-year history, Michelin entered the Philippines for the first time in late 2025, announcing that inspectors were already on the ground in Manila & Environs, and Cebu earlier in the year. How does the Michelin Guide decide which country to head to next? It’s not random. The guide takes a territory-by-territory approach, starting with research, local scouting, and anonymous inspectors on the ground. Part of the process is partnering with tourism bodies of country or local organizations. A country passes the research phase when editors decide that the country is worth a visit. They first determine the depth, density, and variety of the restaurant scene, tourism potential, and whether there’s enough “consistent culinary excellence.” Next, Michelin deploys its anonymous inspectors to dine anonymously, pay their bills, and visit restaurants repeatedly over time. Many times, Michelin’s teams spend months (sometimes even years) researching before an inaugural selection is announced. For some launches, Michelin works with local tourism boards or partners to facilitate research and logistics, with some countries or cities reportedly paying to invite the Michelin Guide over. According to Julianna Twiggs, Michelin’s chief international business development officer, tourism partnerships are the most vital in entering new territories. “We need these partners because what we do is costly,” she said in an NDTV report. However, Michelin is firm in saying that they still practice editorial independence in their selections. The Michelin Star is the most prominent award of the guide, rewarding the quality of the cooking. One star means “a very good restaurant in its category,” two stars means “excellent cooking, worth a detour,” and three stars means “exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey.” Introduced in 1957, the Bib Gourmand distinction was born from Bibendum, indicating establishments serving great food at great value. Value-for-money cuisine is the star of this award, anchored by a country’s local price ceilings. This is usually given to humble eateries, community stalls, and more affordable restaurants. The Michelin Green Star is awarded to restaurants championing sustainability and environmental awareness in its practices and sourcing. It was announced in 2020 and took effect in the 2021 editions. The Michelin Guide also has a Selected roster, a broader set of recommended places that don’t carry a star or award but are still worth the visit and appear on the Michelin Guide website. What began as a tire company’s travel handbook has grown into a distinction that can shape a chef’s career, influence a restaurant’s lifespan, and even guide how diners eat around the world, taking a nation’s culinary pride to greater heights through mere recommendations and those now-famous red-and-white plaques. However, despite the pressure the guide creates, the cuisines and establishments it sometimes overlooks, and the lingering questions around independence when countries pay to bring Michelin in, the impact of the guide cannot be denied. As the guide evolves — adding new badges, expanding its digital presence, and engaging with a more aware and discerning generation of chefs and diners — it remains committed to shining a spotlight on emerging culinary territories and the establishments that deserve to be showcased to the world. – Rappler.com",True,true,How did the Michelin Guide start from a tire company?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/michelin-guide-history-tire-company-founders/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Inflation quickened to 1.8% in December 2025 as strong holiday demand pushed up prices of major food items, the Philippine Statistics Authority reported on Tuesday, January 6. This brings the average inflation rate for 2025 to 1.7%, below the government’s target range of 2% to 4%. According to National Statistician Dennis Mapa, food prices rose at a faster pace in December amid the holiday demand. Recent tropical cyclones also disrupted agricultural production, which led to higher food prices. “Kung naalala ‘nyo, ‘yung buwan ng Nobyembre, may malalakas tayo na bagyo. And this most probably impacted also ‘yung mga vegetable farms natin kaya tumaas ‘yung presyo, particularly sa labas ng National Capital Region,” he explained. (If you recall, we were hit by strong tropical cyclones in November. And this most probably also impacted our vegetable farms, hence the higher prices particularly outside the National Capital Region.) Rice deflation was at -12.3% in December from -15.4% in November, which means prices are now beginning to drop at a slower pace. Prices of vegetables such as eggplant (29.4%), okra (28%), and string beans (24%) notably saw double-digit inflation. Onions and shallots were also among the top contributors to December’s inflation figure, with a 79% inflation rate from 48.2% in November. In Metro Manila, inflation eased to 2.3% from November’s 2.8% due to a slower rise in power rates. Meanwhile, inflation for areas outside the capital region accelerated to 1.7% from the previous month’s 1.2% due to higher food prices. The Central Visayas region continued to record the fastest inflation rate at 3.8%, while the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao continued to log deflation at -1%. Deflation or a negative inflation rate means the general level of prices is going down. Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said the latest inflation print reflected a “proactive and well-coordinated” approach to stabilizing prices and safeguarding Filipinos’ purchasing power. “Building on this momentum, the government will continue to pursue prudent fiscal and monetary coordination and advance structural reforms to sustain the downward inflation trend and support inclusive growth in 2026 and beyond,” he said. DEPDev added that the government is committed to keeping inflation within the 2% to 4% target for the remainder of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s term. Balisacan noted that the 2026 national budget includes a P297.1-billion allocation for the agriculture sector, which aims to boost farmer productivity and strengthen food security. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas earlier forecast inflation in December would settle between 1.2% and 2% due to higher food and gasoline prices. – with reports from Arriane dela Cruz/Rappler.com Arriane dela Cruz is a Rappler intern.

"MANILA, Philippines – Baguio City moved one step closer to getting a world-class transport terminal that aims to alleviate congestion and traffic in the Philippines’ summer capital. Megawide Construction Corporation (Megawide) disclosed to the Philippine Stock Exchange that it received last Friday, October 17, the notice of award for the P1.2 billion Baguio City Integrated Terminal (BCIT) Project that it will put up along Marcos Highway. The BCIT will cater to provincial buses coming from outside Baguio and will serve as a passenger transfer terminal to other modes of transportation going to the city. It will have loading and unloading bays for the provincial and in-city transport, a passenger waiting area with commercial establishments, as well as public parking for park-and-ride. Its other features are: 24-hour safety and security systems, schedule information kiosks, ticket and customer service booths, baggage amenities, free wi-fi, toilets and lactation station, persons with disability-friendly facilities, according to a project description posted by the Baguio City Public Information Office (PIO) last year. In addition, the terminal will also have “high-quality facilities for transportation operators,” such as a “staging area for repair and cleaning, drivers’ lounge, and canteen and electronic vehicle charging,” the Baguio City PIO said. The BCIT seeks to make transfers to various points in and out of the city seamless, which will hopefully prompt people to shift to using public transport. It is designed to accommodate 25,000 passengers daily, both for daily commuters as well as for those from other provinces and cities. Megawide, the company behind the multi-awarded Mactan-Cebu International Airport and the Philippines’ first modern landport Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange or PITX, will build the project under a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with the Baguio City government. City Mayor Benjamin Magalong has long been pushing for the project. A post shared by Megawide (@officialmegawide) “Lahat ng mga buses, hindi na pupunta sa Baguio, ‘di na makakadagdag pa sa congestion. Doon na lahat ang mga pasahero, doon na sasakay, mas maayos, mas systematic, mas malinis. At ‘yung kanilang serbisyo doon, para kang pumasok sa isang airport terminal,” Magalong said in July 2024, after signing an initial agreement with Megawide. (All the buses won’t be going inside Baguio, they won’t be adding to the congestion. All the passengers will ride there. It’s more orderly, more systematic, cleaner. All the services will be there, it’s like you entered an airport terminal.) Magalong has opted for the PPP mode for infrastructure projects in a bid to eliminate corruption. As required under the government’s PPP rules, Megawide had to overcome a Swiss Challenge or comparative challenge from other potential builders. This was held last October 14, and Megawide hurdled it, leading to the award of the project. “Our vision of a First-World Philippines goes beyond building structures and critical facilities — we also need to connect the key districts across the country to promote commerce and accelerate economic activity. We are very thankful to our local government unit (LGU) partners for sharing our common goal and providing opportunities and platforms where socio-economic progress can thrive,” said engineer Edgar Saavedra, Megawide chairman and CEO. The BCIT will be under a 40-year lease agreement between the operator and the Baguio City government. The land for the project is under a usufruct agreement between the Department of Agriculture and Baguio City, Magalong previously said. The terminal intends to serve seven southbound routes from Baguio: to La Union, Pangasinan, Tarlac, Pampanga, Bulacan, Metro Manila, and Cavite via the South Luzon Integrated Terminal Exchange (SLITX). On September 23, a Megawide subsidiary signed a joint venture agreement with Carmona City, Cavite, for the development of the SLITX. This P800-million terminal will serve various destinations, from Baguio in the north and destinations in Visayas and Mindanao. It will have a capacity of 30,000 passengers. “The facility [SLITX] will connect to PITX and other in-city public terminals and will also have direct access to SLEX via new toll entry and exit to be built and completed before it commences operation. With abundant transport options and park-and-ride facilities, SLITX will allow passengers from the South to directly access the central business districts in Metro Manila as well as the Ninoy Aquino International Airport,” Megawide said. “Landports, such as our PITX, BCIT, and SLITX, as well as the ongoing Cavite BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) system, are part of the grand objective to provide the public with safe, secure, and efficient public transport while improving connectivity and enhancing mobility across key cities, initially in Luzon,” said Jaime Feliciano, head of Business Development at Megawide. – Rappler.com",True,true,Baguio City moves closer to having a world-class integrated transport terminal,https://www.rappler.com/business/megawide-bags-baguio-city-integrated-terminal/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – College students looking to unwind during their free time aren’t limited to the same cafés and tambay (hangout) spots. For the art-inclined majors or even anyone looking for some leisure activities around these university areas, some have on-campus museums and galleries that are open to the public. And for those on a budget, the best part is that some offer free admission to university students and staff! The first museum of Philippine modern art, established in 1960, is just within one of the universities along Katipunan. When you enter the Ateneo de Manila University, you can find the Ateneo Art Gallery in the Areté building. Originally built on the donations of Spanish-Filipino painter Fernando Zobel, the museum’s collection features his works and paintings alongside other local artists like Fernando Amorsolo and Napoleon Abueva. These permanent collections are found on the first and second floors, with a wide range of art from impressionist paintings to works that highlight ordinary rural life. A post shared by Ateneo Art Gallery (@ateneoartgallery) Venture to the third floor and you will find a contemporary showcase with an often limited run-time, like this exhibition for the shortlisted awardees of the Ateneo Art Awards 2025. On the other side of Katipunan, the University of the Philippines Diliman has the Vargas Museum. Named after political figure and UP alumnus Jorge B. Vargas, it is home to his collections of art, books, archives, memorabilia, coins, and stamps. Almost nine years after Vargas donated his collection to the university, the building of the museum was formally inaugurated in 1987. After buying a ticket at the ground floor, you’re met upstairs with a temporary exhibition, book launch, or other special events. Go one floor higher, and you find the permanent art collection with works spanning from the late 19th century to the post-war era. In this gallery, the past meets contemporary, as the works of historical artists Juan Luna, Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, and Fernando Amorsolo share a space with invited guest artists Poklong Anading, Roberto Feleo, and Alfredo Juan. Reach the third floor, and you see the archives, library, and the Vargas memorabilia. This also houses the North Wing Gallery, which features mostly photography and contemporary art. Did you know the oldest museum in the country is tucked away in España? Originally standing on Intramuros in 1869, the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Museum has since been transferred to the UST Main Building in Sampaloc. It started as compliance with a requirement for colleges to have a museum of natural history, which displayed specimens of shells, butterflies, and birds. After the old main building underwent renovation, old paintings were uncovered and eventually displayed in the new building, transforming the museum from purely scientific to mixing it with the arts. Now, apart from the original natural history collection featuring Philippine fauna, you will find historical coins, medals, and memorabilia displayed. Student life from 300 years ago is preserved through the display of bells, dry seal stamps, and maces used for special occasions like graduations. Of course, art-lovers cannot miss the visual arts collection, featuring a mix of paintings from the 16th to 20th century, with works from Juan Luna, Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, Manuel Zaragosa, Simeon Flores, Fabian de la Rosa, and many others. After just a short walk from the De La Salle College of Saint Benilde, you’ll find the Museum of Contemporary Art and Design (MCAD). Unlike other galleries, MCAD has no permanent collections, as it offers a space for artists to exhibit their works. Its most recent exhibit was Elisa Tan: Container of Distance, showcasing the Filipino-Chinese artist’s minimalist, conceptual art, wherein she weaves together themes of language, migration, and belonging. A post shared by MCAD Manila (@mcadmanila) Apart from art exhibitions, MCAD also offers learning programs and other cultural and artistic opportunities that emphasize the possibilities of contemporary media and encourage engagement with art and culture. Since the museum temporarily closes to make way for preparations in between exhibitions, it’s best to stay updated on the MCAD Facebook page for their latest events and exhibits. While most museums display paintings, exhibits, or artifacts, one located along Padre Faura Street in Manila shows something a bit more abstract: ideas. The University of the Philippines Manila Museum of a History of Ideas (UPM-HI) showcases the intellectual history of the university and how it contributed to nation-building over the years. According to its website, “Ideas are like artifacts. They are created by societies in particular times and places for particular reasons.” It has seven interlinked galleries and five atria that display different images, sounds, and videos. But these just serve to supplement the ideas, which are the main thing the museum aims to present to viewers. While the museums accept walk-ins, guests are encouraged to book their visit through their Facebook page. – Rappler.com Alyana Fabella is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the Ateneo de Manila University.",True,true,"View art after the bell rings at these 5 galleries, museums in universities",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/galleries-museums-philippine-universities/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Following a disappointing third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) of 4%, what should the Marcos administration do in the coming months? If you ask the president of the Philippines’ largest mall developer and operator, the government’s plan to focus spending on social services for the rest of the year is a welcome development. “If you look at what happened in the last month or so, obviously because of the challenges and the scandals that have happened, government has actually, in a way, stopped infrastructure spending,” said Jeffrey Lim, president of SM Prime Holdings, in a press briefing on Monday, November 10, on the conglomerate’s third quarter earnings. “And I think, given that they’ll probably shift their spending priorities into social services than infrastructure, we hope that Q4 will be better for consumer spending as they would disburse more in the fourth quarter.” Led by its malls business, SM Prime reported an 8% year-on-year increase in its third-quarter net income to P12.8 billion from P11.8 billion. This lifted its nine-month profit to P37.2 billion, up 10% from P33.9 billion a year earlier. Together with steady inflation and lower interest rates, Lim said the government’s spending strategy “would create an environment where consumer spending will be better in November and in the [Christmas] holidays and into 2026.” The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) announced last week that it plans to spend around P1.3 trillion, mostly in social services, in the last quarter of 2025, amid the big drop in government construction spending. The 4% third-quarter GDP translates to a 5% GDP in the first nine months of 2025, which means the government will likely miss its GDP target of 5.5 to 6.5% in 2025. “Our programmed spending for the fourth quarter will boost year-end economic growth and thus impact overall economic growth for the year,” said Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman, in a press statement last Thursday, November 6. Among the priority social services in the last quarter, according to the DBM, are the following: Disaster aid Social welfare Agriculture Education Labor Health Year-end benefits The DBM said that as of October 27, it had already released Notices of Cash Allocations amounting to P1.13 trillion of the P1.3 trillion program for the fourth quarter of 2025. “I urge all departments and agencies — gamitin natin ang budget, gastusin nang tama at siguruhing makakarating sa ating mga kababayan (use the budget, spend it correctly, and make sure it reaches our people),” Pangandaman said. Meantime, Joey Salceda, a former Albay representative and a former economic adviser to several presidents, suggested in a research paper last Friday, November 7, that if the Marcos government puts the brakes on infrastructure spending, it “must compensate through aid,” especially in light of the series of natural disasters the country has had to deal with. “When people see billions for flood control while communities remain flooded, they demand accountability. But if pursuing accountability freezes infrastructure, we must keep money flowing another way,” he said. “The P100 billion sitting idle could be redirected to disaster response.” Salceda, however, said disaster assistance should just be a temporary measure, and that the government should still pursue infrastructure projects because if all public works are stopped out of caution, “the public pays twice: once for corruption, again for paralysis.” “The gap between Q3 2024’s 12.8% investment growth and Q3 2025’s negative 2.8% represents lost development momentum. The human cost is starker: the difference between consensus 5.4% growth and actual 4% means 200,000 to 250,000 Filipinos remain in poverty who otherwise would have escaped it,” he said. Salceda said the government should determine “which [infrastructure] projects may proceed, which are under review, which are suspended.” “A safe harbor policy will provide a sense of assurance for officials who just want to do their jobs. By making clear what conditions are required so that a project is not considered suspect, things can move. Cases with credible irregularities should be suspended specifically, not systemically,” he said. Salceda urged Public Works and Highways Secretary Vince Dizon to “make the rules clearer so that the clean [DPWH personnel] can proceed with the rules on their side.” “Instead, for example, of treating FLR projects as entirely suspect, rules can be made clear so that their release is conditional on readiness to implement and accountability of implementation,” he said. – Rappler.com",True,true,What Marcos administration can do to arrest slower economic growth in 2025,https://www.rappler.com/business/marcos-administration-spending-trillion-peso-fourth-quarter-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — A society where no one gets left behind is the dream for many Filipinos. For three women with deeply personal advocacies, that vision looks like a Philippines where persons with disabilities, neurodivergent adults and children, and Filipino athletes not only receive care, but also experience dignity, opportunity, and belonging. During the Rappler Social Good Summit 2025 on Sunday, November 16, the panel “Resilience, Well-being, and Purpose” brought together Saab Magalona-Bacarro, Michelle Aventajado, and Aleah Finnegan, championing different causes with a common thread: inclusion and acceptance for all. Through their own stories and on-the-ground experiences, each woman painted a picture of what an inclusive and truly “resilient” Philippines could — and should — look like. Aventajado, the executive director of Best Buddies Philippines, a global nonprofit supporting individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, believes that inclusion starts from even the smallest of victories for children with special needs. “Whether it’s my daughter being included in a class they said she could not participate in because she had Down syndrome, or an individual who just got a job and now has a bank account… Did you know that individuals with autism or blindness are not allowed to open their own bank accounts?” Aventajado shared, pointing out that inclusion also starts from systemic change – from workplace practices and government protocols. “And now, the individuals we placed in employment have their own payroll account, full benefits, and health insurance. The success stories fuel me and our volunteers all around the country.” Magalona-Bacarro, podcaster for Wake Up With Jim and Saab, mental health advocate, and founder of the Chaos Control Club – an ADHD-focused coaching community – began her personal advocacy with her own family. “I’m an advocate for ADHD and also Cerebral Palsy. My son has Cerebral Palsy. And I got diagnosed with ADHD after I had two kids — perfect timing because my kids needed me. I was drowning in self-doubt. My children are the reason why I needed the support I could get and why I wanted to extend that accessibility to Filipinos,” Magalona-Bacarro shared. Aleah Finnegan — 2024 Olympian, SEA Games multi-medalist, and advocate for uplifting young Filipino gymnasts — gets real about her definition of inclusion for the athlete community. “As somebody who represents the Philippines, we’re kind of overlooked in sports. So when somebody tells us no, resilience is looking them in the eye and saying, ‘I can do this, and I will.’ Being resilient takes a huge mental toll — on you and the people you support.” For Aleah, competing can get mentally difficult — the pressure to always perform and appear “okay,” despite personal struggles and the inevitable failures, can make any athlete feel alone and afraid. Community support, her fans, and her family are what keep her grounded. “Honestly, what inspires me is the support from young athletes — really just Filipinos in general… On the hard days when I don’t want to train, that’s what I draw from. Maybe a little girl is watching me thinking, ‘If she can do that, then maybe I can too.’” But her strongest support system has always been her family. “Growing up, I was in the gym six hours a day, six days a week. When I got home, my parents would ask, ‘How was practice?’ Sometimes we’d talk, sometimes we’d talk about anything except the gym. That balance kept me going.” For Magalona-Bacarro, she explained what ADHD feels like. “It’s like watching multiple TV screens at the same time, and you can’t pick one. Every task is screaming at you at the same volume. When you finally understand what’s happening in your brain, you stop calling yourself lazy — you learn how to move forward and say, ‘This is my brain, and that’s okay.'” Accepting her diagnosis and understanding herself better happened through community coaching. “Group coaching worked best for me. Even if I was just lurking, hearing other people’s stories made me feel like I wasn’t going crazy. I wasn’t being dramatic. Studies show community support for ADHDers is very effective.” She was initially part of a group coaching program in the US, and it was “so effective” that she wanted to bring it to the Philippines. “We do weekly coaching calls, a private podcast feed, ADHD education, and the best part — a community where we talk about what we’re going through.” For Aventajado, inclusion is built on shared safe spaces and making areas accessible to all. “I’ve been involved in the disability community since I was 14 — even in New York. When my daughter was born, the light bulb went off. The Lord put me here to prepare me for her.” She recalled the moment she knew she had to lead her own community, advocating for those who couldn’t do so for themselves. Best Buddies creates friendships, leadership opportunities, and job placements. “My son got into a fight because someone used the R word. He said, ‘My sister has Down syndrome, it’s hurtful.’ The kid said he’d still use it. They came to blows. I realized — if in his school people are using these words, I needed to walk the walk.” “Individuals with disabilities suffer from social isolation. By 21, most will not have any friends outside of family or medical staff. We match buddies so they can have real friendships,” Aventajado added. One yearly event Best Buddies is most proud of is Dance Night at Xylo, Bonifacio Global City. “We close down the club so our young adults can dance. Nobody’s drinking — they’re just dancing. It’s part of socializing and belonging. We make Xylo accessible with ramps, and we train bartenders and bouncers on disability inclusion. It’s not just you can sit with us — it’s you can dance with us.” All women agreed that our call to action needs to first be rooted in education, awareness, acceptance, and saying “yes” more often. “I want to say that there’s no shame in having a disability. It starts with awareness. Education. And then we have the opportunity to educate people about disabilities. When you accept people where they are, you’re that much closer to including everyone where a society where no one is left behind,” Aventajado said. Magalona urged openness — let people ask questions, be curious, and jump off from their curiosity to spread awareness in a non-judgmental, compassionate way. “Back then, there were a lot more people hiding their children just at home. They were ashamed of protecting their kids. For me I love showing off what my kid can do. I love it when people ask — questions are encouraged,” she said. “It’s an opportunity to educate well-meaning kids and people who are curious to learn more. Keep doing the research, keep getting answers. Don’t make it taboo. I like that we’re having conversations about this. We’re a lot more forward.” For Finnegan, she said that access to resources is key for Filipino athletes. “The biggest resource we need is budget. Better equipment, facilities, and air conditioning. Support other sports too. We have the Junior World Championships here this week. These young athletes are so talented — you won’t want to miss it.” Government support is improving, she said, but more is needed. “There’s improvement, and that’s a good change. But we need more coaches, more support, so athletes continue to love the sport,” she added. And to build a more supportive culture, she wants athletes to remember that it’s okay to cry, and it’s okay to be upset. “It’s not always sparkles and rainbows,” she reminded. “We need understanding that athletes are human, too.” For these three strong women, an inclusive society is one where access is truly democratized — where children with special needs can earn their own money, where Filipino athletes do not fear showing emotion, and where adults can speak openly about mental health and know it is never too late to find community, healing, and answers. – Rappler.com Video recordings of all Social Good Summit 2025 main hall sessions will soon be available to all Rappler+ members.

"MANILA, Philippines – International human rights lawyer Amal Clooney wore a Filipino designer as she delivered the keynote address at Rappler’s Social Good Summit on Sunday, November 16. In a brief chat before the event, Clooney told Rappler that her bedazzled outfit was designed by Monique Lhuillier, proudly noting that she was wearing Filipino. Lhuillier, a Cebuana designer known for her red-carpet and bridal couture, shared the moment on Instagram, noting that Clooney wore the Metallic Poppy knit from her Spring 2026 collection. A post shared by Monique Lhuillier (@moniquelhuillier) On Lhuillier’s website, the Spring 2026 collection is described as a “celebration of radiant femininity” in a season that is “feminine, fearless, and full of life.” Metallic Poppy channels that vision in a striking red that is both elegant and commanding. In her keynote speech, Clooney called for the decriminalization of libel, highlighted ongoing threats to press freedom, and announced a new initiative to provide legal aid for Filipino women and journalists.

"MANILA, Philippines — The one where Filipino fans get to live their sitcom dreams! For the first time, “The Friends Experience” has landed in Asia, and it’s currently open to the public at The Space at Solaire in Parañaque City until November 30. The exhibit attraction has toured the US, Canada, and Europe since 2023. The hit series, which aired from 1994 to 2004, starred Jennifer Aniston (Rachel Green), Courteney Cox (Monica Geller), Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe Buffay), Matt LeBlanc (Joey Tribbiani), Matthew Perry (Chandler Bing), and David Schwimmer (Ross Geller). Over Friends’ decades-long run and more than 200 episodes, it’s hard not to imagine what it’s like to be part of the gang, hanging out on the orange couch or living across the hall in Monica’s apartment. “The Friends Experience” turns that dream into reality, with its immersive walk-through installations, recreated sets, and photo-worthy spots straight from the show’s most memorable moments. Whether you’re coming with friends and family for a planned visit or just going solo, the staff are ready to help you snap your photos, and you might even meet fellow fans of all ages just by chatting about your favorite Friends moments. So, while you’re getting your phones and cameras ready, here’s a rundown of the iconic photo spots you can expect! Fans will instantly recognize this iconic setup from the Friends opening credits. The orange couch marks the gang’s favorite hangout spot inside Central Perk coffeehouse, where Rachel Green once worked as a waitress. In the opening credits, the sofa is famously placed in front of the Cherry Hill Fountain in New York’s Central Park. Paired with its unforgettable theme song, “I’ll Be There for You” by The Rembrandts, this scene has become deeply etched in every fan’s memory. You’ll find this photo-worthy spot both inside and outside the exhibit. Outside, you can strike a pose before even stepping in, while inside, it serves as the first photo stop where a staff member takes your picture. Who could ever forget Ross’s hilarious attempt to bring his new couch up to his apartment? In season five, Episode 16, titled The One with the Cop, fans can’t help but burst into laughter every time Ross yells, “Pivot!” while Rachel and Chandler struggle to maneuver the couch up the building’s narrow staircase. You’ll definitely feel like you’re stepping right into the duo’s apartment with this realistic recreation of their room! From the small yellow sofa on the side, the Foosball table and dartboard in the kitchen area, to the two lounge chairs the boys always sit on while watching TV, the space captures the sweet friendship of Joey and Chandler. As a fun bonus, the walls are decorated with Magna Doodles filled with quirky messages and doodles from each character. In the series, this blue drawing board was a recurring element hanging on the back of the door in Joey and Chandler’s apartment. This space witnessed many of the show’s most memorable moments — from friendship dramas and heartfelt confrontations to secret romances and tender celebrations. Inside the exhibit, fans can channel their favorite characters or strike playful poses for photos in the apartment’s iconic kitchen and dining area and by the familiar doorway. ​​As the final photo stop, this spacious room recreates the full setup of the Central Perk coffeehouse, complete with the orange sofa and counter. Fans can even wear a green Central Perk apron and snap a photo behind the counter for the full barista or waitress experience. The exhibit also features installations showcasing the characters’ signature fashion style, signed scripts from select episodes, and a detailed blueprint of the set design. Visitors can read statements from the show’s executive producers — Marta Kauffman, David Crane, and Kevin Bright — who share their inspiration for creating Friends and memorable experiences from the early days of filming. It also includes insights from Burton Morris, the artist behind the colorful pop-art pieces seen throughout the set, as well as a recorded interview with Debra McGuire, the visionary costume designer who helped define each character’s distinctive look. These exhibit elements are designed to take you on a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Each character has a dedicated profile that revisits their story and role in the series. Scattered throughout the exhibit are some of the show’s most memorable props, including Ross’ Science Boy comic book (season nine, episode 15), Rachel’s signature hairstyles, Rachel’s 18-page love letter to Ross (season four, episode one), Pat the Dog (season two, episode 17) — Joey’s prized purchase after landing an acting role, an installation of when Joey wears Chandler’s clothes (season three, episode two), and the famous turkey prop (season five, episode eight). Another fun highlight of the exhibit is the massive relationship tracker board featuring all the characters. Across 10 seasons, each of them went through countless dates, flings, and breakups before finally finding their own happy endings. At the end of the exhibit, fans can take home a piece of “The Friends Experience” through the merchandise shop. It offers a wide selection of souvenirs, including keychains, magnets, earrings, shirts, hoodies, picture frames, and many more. If the exhibit photos aren’t enough, there’s also a bonus photo booth where visitors can line up to get instant prints of their pictures in Friends-themed frames. It’s a cute keepsake to remember your visit! Walking out of the exhibit will make you miss the gang all over again. It’s the kind of experience that makes you want to curl up on the couch and start a Friends marathon from season one. “The Friends Experience” opened its doors on October 8, Wednesday. Tickets are on sale via TicketWorld.

"Claim: House Speaker Martin Romualdez was suspended from office. Why we fact-checked this: The YouTube video bearing the claim, posted on June 25, has gained 18,894 views, 455 likes, and 82 comments. The video’s thumbnail shows photos of Romualdez, Vice President Sara Duterte, and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. seemingly holding a document. Text on the thumbnail reads: “Pina-suspend si Martin (Martin was suspended).” The bottom line: Romualdez remains a member of the lower chamber and is House Speaker of the current 19th Congress. While the video’s thumbnail implies that Marcos ordered Romualdez’s suspension, the President cannot suspend a sitting House member. Article VI, Section 16, of the Constitution explains the process: “Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds of all its Members, suspend or expel a Member. A penalty of suspension, when imposed, shall not exceed sixty days.” Romualdez and Duterte ties: The misleading video didn’t provide any information to prove its claim. Instead, the narrator merely commented on Romualdez’s remarks on Duterte’s decision to resign from the Marcos Cabinet. Asked to comment on the Vice President stepping down as education secretary, Romualdez said: “As the Vice President mentioned, I think this was her personal decision, and we respect the decision.” Romualdez served as Duterte’s campaign manager during the 2022 elections and both were then members of the political party Lakas-CMD. However, rumors of an alleged rift swirled during the 2023 budget hearings, when the House of Representatives stripped Duterte of her confidential funds for 2024. The Vice President’s political allies were also demoted from their senior roles in the lower chamber, and some lawmakers began supporting probes into the Dutertes, particularly resolutions urging government cooperation with the International Criminal Court’s investigation into former president Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war. On June 24, Romualdez said he still wished Duterte well. “We only wish the vice president nothing but the best and we wish her always the best of luck in all endeavors and in her service to the Filipino people.” – Andrei Santos/Rappler.com Andrei Santos is a graduate of Rappler’s fact-checking mentorship program.

"The market is starting the year at the 6,052.92 level of the Philippine Stock Exchange index or PSEi. This starting point is also the best the market has achieved in 2025. Comparatively, it is 7.29% lower than the market’s 2024 trading close of 6,528.79, rendering 2025 as one of the most challenging years the bourse had ever experienced since the pandemic. This also ranked the market to be among the worst performing stock trading centers in East and Southeast Asia this year. (READ: Value trap: Why the PSE is one of world’s worst-performing markets) Nevertheless, average net value turnover for 2025 has improved to P5.91 billion per day from P5.15 billion in 2024. In hindsight, a mix of domestic issues and global economic shifts influenced the market’s poor performance. On top among the domestic issues is the flood control funds scandal. Investor trust and confidence was severely dented by the massive extent of corruption in the flood-control projects. The ongoing probes showed rampant misuse of billions of pesos allocated for flood management initiatives, discovery of “ghost” projects, rampant use of substandard construction materials and construction activities, and the alleged massive cornering of contracts by a small group of favored contractors working under some political personalities. This scandal drove down the market to a five-year low at 5,584.35 on November 14, 2025, the market’s lowest since its 5,570.22 close on May 28, 2020. (READ: Value trap: Why the PSE is one of world’s worst-performing markets) Investor confidence fell further after GDP grew by only 4% in the third quarter, the country’s slowest in more than four years. This also brought down the economy’s nine-month average to 5%, below the government 5.5-6.5% GDP growth target for the year. (READ: [In This Economy] When corruption drowns growth: The PH economy in 2025) As noted earlier, foreign investors were likewise persistent net sellers throughout the year, cashing out due to governance concerns at the same time lured by higher-performing regional peers. The net outflows of foreign investors reached P47.13 billion in 2025, 86.6% higher than their net outflows of P25.25-billion in 2024. Contributing further to the market’s soft performance is the volatility of the Philippine peso. It closed at P58.79 against the US dollar and hit the all-time low of P59.22. But towards the end of last year, the Philippines was awarded certain tariff exemptions on its agricultural products by the United States, boosting is chances for higher economic activity. In November, S&P Global gave the country a BBB+ credit rating on the following considerations: the country’s emerging strong economic recovery, effective fiscal policies, prudent actions by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) in keeping inflation low, ongoing reforms (like the Public-Private Partnership or PPP laws), and solid external position, which can potentially work for further upgrades as the country continues fiscal consolidation and reduces deficits, with expectations for continued high growth despite temporary slowdowns. This rating improved the market’s outlook. The rate cuts instituted in December by both the BSP and the US Federal Reserve further helped the market show signs of stabilization as it recovered from its low. However, its rebound was muted in the end due to lingering concerns on ”fiscal and political risks,” as expressed by most market analysts like Mark Angeles, the trading coach of First Metro Sec’s stock playbook. Amid the advice for a defensive play, this column is going ahead with the recommendation to buy Globe Telecom (GLO), a stock pick also found among the top 10 stocks favored by Angeles and his stockbrokerage house. Globe Telecom is an ideal investment essentially for its strong connectivity services, high dividend yields, and digital growth potential. As of late 2025, the company has transitioned from a traditional telecommunications provider into a company with significant interests in fintech, healthtech, and other digital solutions. In June 2025, Globe Telecom was recognized as the “Most Recommended Telco Brand” in the Philippines by SYNERGY/YouGov with its reportedly high performance in mobile video streaming, gaming, and voice apps. GLO is an outright winner on its 5G network in the following experience categories: premium perks through its postpaid “Platinum” plans that offer high-end lifestyle benefits, including international and local airport lounge access, 24/7 digital concierge services, and medical insurance. Globe’s GFiber plans provide high-speed home internet (up to 1.5 Gbps) bundled with entertainment subscriptions like Disney+ and 24/7 telehealth consultations via KonsultaMD. Conversely, Globe Telecom maintains a payout ratio of approximately 70% to 76% of its core net income, often maintaining a dividend yield between 5.42% and 5.8% per year. With its ownership in Mynt, the operator of GCash, Globe Telecom further stands out as an investment target. GCash is regarded as “the Philippines’ first US$5 billion Unicorn.” It dominates the cashless payment market with over six million partner merchants. The IPO of GCash will significantly contribute to Globe Telecom’s share valuation upswing. Globe Telecom has successfully pursued strategic diversification in other digital ventures like the telehealth platform KonsultaMD, 917Ventures a corporate venture builder for startups in adtech, e-commerce, and logistics. It has been expanding in data centers through its partnerships with ST Telemedia Global Data Centres and Ayala Corporation. Up to now, Globe Telecom remains to be the leading mobile network operator in the Philippines by subscriber base and market value. Globe Telecom is recognized for its sustainability practices, holding an “AA” rating from MSCI ESG Ratings and being a constituent of the FTSE4Good Index for nine consecutive years. Globe Telecom faces strong pressure from its main rival PLDT, which currently leads in the enterprise and fixed broadband sectors. Newer players like DITO have also challenged Globe Telecom’s speeds in some regions. Some analysts suggest Globe Telecom trades at a valuation premium due to its fintech assets, which can make the stock price sensitive to any changes in GCash’s growth trajectory. Globe Telecom is a compelling investment proposition: it’s a leader in the Philippine telecom industry, with strong brand and network and has successfully pivoted from a traditional telco to a tech-driven business, expanding its portfolio beyond connectivity. For one, its mobile wallet, GCash, is a major driver of digital financial services and revenue growth. In 2024, Globe Telecom achieved record revenues, maintaining strong EBITDA margins through cost-saving initiatives. Its management has been generously offering a competitive dividend yield, paying out a significant portion of earnings to shareholders. Finally, Globe Telecom is expected to thrive due to significant investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the growing need for efficient healthcare solutions, and global sustainability efforts, making it a balanced play for growth and income.

"Traveling across the Philippines can be a gateway to discovering the country’s vast pool of talents in creating crafts and heritage arts. From the intricate weaves of the Ifugao to the colorful inaul cloth of Maguindanao and countless others, each piece tells a story of tradition and identity, passed down through generations. In a laidback town in Iloilo province, amid the peaceful, small-town vibe of Santa Barbara, a group of women gather around, their fingers nimbly maneuvering threads around small spools. They’re creating what the tour guide says is a bobbin lace, a delicate, lacework technique that looks almost too fine to be handmade. It’s a meticulous crafting process, unfolding in a place with an origin story worth telling. The story of WUHTLE (Women United Through Handcrafted Lace and Embroidery) traces its origins to the 1980s, inside the Western Visayas Sanitarium in Santa Barbara. It began with a simple gesture: the daughter of a patient handed a delicately embroidered handkerchief to a Belgian missionary, Sister Madeleine Dieryck, who was then working with people affected by leprosy. The handiwork amazed Sister Dieryck’s eye immediately. She then began teaching embroidery to the women under her care, only to realize that many patients, their hands altered by the effects of leprosy, struggled to hold a needle. While taking a break back in her hometown in Belgium, Sister Dieryck thought of a solution. There, she sought to learn the craft of bobbin lace, a technique built not on needles but on the manipulation of pins, threads, and wooden bobbins. When she returned to the sanitarium, Sister Dieryck introduced the craft to her patients. The women took to it with focus and determination. By 1996, their small circle of lace makers had formally organized into a cooperative, laying the foundation for what would become WUHTLE. Among those keeping the tradition alive is Lola Delia, 75. Her fingers, deformed by years of illness, move with practiced ease across the threads. She has been crafting bobbin lace for more than three decades. Today, she and her fellow artisans produce intricate lacework and embroidered pieces that have found buyers far beyond the shores of the Philippines, a testament to resilience woven, quite literally, by hand. “It’s a rare craft, one of the most expensive laces in the world, and its production keeps shrinking as time goes by. To think that a small community of women here in Santa Barbara are its keepers makes their work extraordinary,” says veteran Iloilo tour guide Erlyn Alunan. “What began as a lifeline for those shunned because of their illness has become a unique heritage of the province.” Displayed in the small workshop are several of the women’s pieces, their designs ranging from colorful birds to religious symbols. Depending on the complexity, each one takes anywhere from a day and a few days to several weeks to complete. Aside from providing a livelihood for the roughly 30 bobbin lace makers still practicing the craft — a fraction of its numbers at its peak decades ago — the cooperative now hopes that renewed public interest might inspire a new generation to carry the skills forward. Beyond its role as a source of income, this profession harnessed by WUHTLE adds another layer to Iloilo province’s cultural and commercial identity. Located on the island of Panay, Iloilo is already celebrated for its indigenous products: from hablon and patadyong weaving to pottery, basketry, and panubok embroidery. Though bobbin lace does not stem from local tradition, it reinforces the region’s reputation for artistry and has the potential to draw visitors and collectors, particularly those with an eye for art and fashion. “The value the bobbin lace makers bring to Iloilo’s tourism is immense, operating on three critical levels at once,” said Department of Tourism Region 6 Director Krisma Rodriguez. “It diversifies and deepens our portfolio by moving beyond grand heritage sites toward ‘slow tourism,’ offering immersive cultural experiences that reveal the province’s living artisanal soul.” “It also champions sustainable, community-based tourism, as every purchase provides a direct, dignified livelihood for the artisans, empowering the community and sustaining the enterprise from the ground up,” Rodriguez added. “Finally, it creates a cycle of heritage preservation, where visitor interest validates this patient, exquisite craft, ensuring these invaluable skills are passed on and safeguarded for future generations.” Heritage preservation is often overlooked in travel, and it’s a lesson that can be learned from the women of Santa Barbara — that beyond the picturesque sights and postcard moments, there are opportunities to witness creativity and craft. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Discovering the bobbin lace makers of Santa Barbara, Iloilo",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/discovering-bobbin-lace-makers-santa-barbara-iloilo/,Rappler
"Anthropic, the artificial intelligence startup backed by Alphabet’s Google and Amazon.com, has hired the law firm Wilson Sonsini to prepare for an initial public offering that could take place as early as 2026, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, December 2. An IPO would give the company, which operates the AI chatbot Claude, a more efficient way to raise capital and provide leverage for bigger acquisitions through public stock. The move comes as AI adoption gains pace, driven by higher enterprise tech spending and growing investor appetite. An Anthropic spokesperson told Reuters the company has not decided when or even if it will go public. The company has previously turned to Wilson Sonsini for a range of corporate matters. The law firm did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment on the FT report outside normal business hours. Anthropic could be prepared to list in 2026, according to the report. The startup has also discussed with major investment banks about a potential IPO, the newspaper said, citing sources. The FT report said, however, that the talks are in early stages and informal, indicating the company is still far from selecting its IPO underwriters. Anthropic is negotiating a private funding round that could give the startup a valuation exceeding $300 billion, the report added. Dario Amodei-led Anthropic is projecting to more than double and potentially nearly triple its annualized revenue run rate to around $26 billion next year. It has more than 300,000 business and enterprise customers. Microsoft-backed OpenAI, a major rival, is preparing for what could rank among the largest IPO ever, with a potential valuation of up to $1 trillion. The firm is laying the groundwork to go public and may file with securities regulators as early as the second half of 2026, Reuters has reported. OpenAI’s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, said later in November that a listing is not in the startup’s near-term plans. Last month, Microsoft and Nvidia announced plans to invest up to $15 billion in Anthropic as the AI firm made a $30 billion commitment to use Microsoft’s cloud services. Founded in 2021 by former OpenAI staff, Anthropic was recently valued at $183 billion. – Rappler.com",True,true,Anthropic plans an IPO as early as 2026 – report,https://www.rappler.com/technology/anthropic-plans-initial-public-offering/,Rappler
"PARIS, France – L’Oreal Paris drew crowds to a celebrity-packed spectacle outside the French capital’s historic Hotel de Ville on Monday, where models and Hollywood icons strutted down an open-air catwalk to celebrate beauty, empowerment and sisterhood. Bright red, black, gold and white dresses, with lots of glitter, adorned the models and actors as they blew kisses to fans and hugged one another in the show on the opening day of Paris Fashion Week. The event was streamed live on Instagram and TikTok, growing channels for beauty product sales. “I think it sets the tone for the week. It fills the night with so much excitement and energy. I’m not a model but it’s fun to pretend to be a model,” American actress Eva Longoria told Reuters ahead of the show. Other stars strutting for L’Oreal Paris included Andie MacDowell and Viola Davis, both wearing bright red lipstick, Jane Fonda in a tight golden bodysuit, while model Kendall Jenner closed the show in a long, white gown.

"If you give a woman a safe enough space, she will tell you her abortion story. I know because many women have entrusted me with theirs. One woman told me about getting an abortion after an incident of marital rape left her with an unwanted pregnancy just as she was about to leave her abusive husband. Another woman, without apology, shared that she and her husband decided together to have an abortion. They had evaluated their circumstances and decided that termination of the pregnancy was the best option for their family. And once, a Rappler reader reached out to me after reading one of my columns about abortion. She was frustrated and furious. Two doctors had diagnosed her pregnancy as not viable because of fetal anomalies. The fetus would not survive should she carry to term. Her life was endangered, but neither of the doctors would perform the needed procedure because abortion is criminalized. One doctor could not even say the word “abortion”. She told me that she and her partner were in a rush to explore countries abroad, such as Singapore, which could provide safe and legal procedures and English-speaking medical staff. There are a handful of others, but each story was told in private. In the security of a hotel conference room, a confidential personal call. In the Philippines, abortion is not only criminalized — It is unspeakable. The movie, Sunshine, tells another story of abortion, with tenderness and compassion that is often missing in this conversation. The film by Antoinette Jadaone follows a young gymnast named Sunshine, whose dreams are suddenly upended by an unplanned pregnancy. It is a fictional story that mirrors the reality for many women and vulva owners in the Philippines. When I saw the film in Berlin, some women in the audience reacted as though it were their own story. They cried. But more importantly, they spoke. One shared how she, like Sunshine, had once combed the streets of Quiapo searching for a way to terminate her pregnancy. Statistics show that one in four women or people with vulvas will need an abortion in their lifetime. Some as a matter of choice, some as a matter of necessity — because an abortion would save their life. The Philippines is one of the countries with the harshest anti-abortion laws. Abortion is prohibited — without exception. Not for rape. Not for incest. Not for pregnancies that threaten a woman’s health or life. Not even for cases of fetal anomaly that guarantee suffering for both mother and child. Alternatives are open only to those with the resources to access abortion in other countries and other similar covert means. That silence does not stop women from getting an abortion. It just makes it unsafe. According to figures compiled by the Philippine Safe Abortion Advocacy Network (PINSAN), an estimated 1.1 million induced abortions occur every year. About 1,000 women die annually from unsafe procedures that include herbal concoctions, coat hangers, and catheters. Around 90,000 women suffer serious complications such as hemorrhage, infection, or uterine trauma. When complications arise, seeking medical care can mean encountering treatment delays, humiliation, or even threats of prosecution. Criminalization of abortion punishes the powerless. I know because I have heard these stories, too. In the urban communities that dot the fringes of our riverbanks and back alleys, women have told me about the shame imposed on them. I still remember the first abortion story shared with me in a community health clinic in Malabon. I was still new to the sexuality rights beat. The woman had a spontaneous abortion that would lead to miscarriage. The medical staff at the hospital did not believe that it was a spontaneous abortion. Bleeding and in pain, they made her wait before receiving treatment. When they called her in, she was referred to as “Ms. Abortionist” instead of her name. I was incensed and indignant. Seeing my reaction, the woman told me, “That won’t happen to you, ma’am. It will only happen to us.” Inequality is built into our anti-abortion laws. The World Health Organization is unequivocal: abortion is a common health intervention. When done safely by trained providers, it is extremely safe. It becomes dangerous only when countries like ours insist on turning it into a crime. That only highlights the difference between who gets access to abortion services and who does not. We need to stop portraying abortion as a punishment for sex or as a crime that warrants a life sentence of guilt. Until we decriminalize abortion, the Philippines will continue to be a country where motherhood is coerced, where dignity is optional for poor women, and where pregnant people are exposed to avoidable risk and preventable stigma just for making decisions about their own bodies. Abortion is health care. Abortion is a human right. The law must finally reflect that. If you give a woman a safe enough space, she will tell you her abortion story. I know because I have heard these stories. Now, try to imagine what could happen if we made our laws a safe space. – Rappler.com The World Health Organization has designated September 28 as International Safe Abortion Day to raise awareness about the importance of safe, respectful, and rights-based abortion care as a fundamental part of health and human rights Ana P.

"MANILA, Philippines – Year-end tax compliance is often seen as a routine obligation, but for businesses and individual taxpayers, it plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate reporting, avoiding penalties, and minimizing audit risks. As 2025 ends, taxpayers are encouraged to review their records early and prepare for the key requirements due in the first quarter of 2026. Year-end compliance goes beyond simply filing tax returns. It involves reconciling income, expenses, payroll, and taxes withheld throughout the year to ensure that all figures are accurate and consistent. Addressing these tasks before year-end helps reduce the risk of penalties, prevents discrepancies that could trigger audits, and makes the preparation of annual income tax returns significantly smoother. Employers and taxpayers should pay close attention to annual payroll and withholding requirements, particularly the submission of alphalists and certificates to employees and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Employees must receive their BIR Form 2316, or Certificate of Compensation Payment and Tax Withheld, on or before January 31, 2026. Employers, meanwhile, are required to submit copies of Form 2316 to the BIR or their respective Revenue District Office by February 28, 2026. The BIR Form 1604-C, which summarizes taxes withheld on compensation along with the alphalist of employees, is due on January 31, 2026. For payments such as professional fees and rentals, these are generally subject to expanded withholding taxes (EWT) rather than final withholding tax (FWT), and should be reported through BIR Form 1604-F, also due January 31, 2026. Meanwhile, BIR Form 1604-E, covering creditable or expanded withholding taxes and accompanied by the alphalist of payees, is due on March 1, 2026. It is essential that payroll records, withholding tax returns, and alphalists are fully reconciled. Any mismatch between amounts reported and taxes actually remitted during the year may result in penalties or assessments. Properly maintained books of accounts remain a cornerstone of tax compliance. Whether manual, loose-leaf, or computerized, books must be complete and updated. These records support the figures declared in tax returns and help avoid issues should the BIR review or audit a taxpayer’s filings. Aside from payroll and books, businesses should prepare an annual inventory list, particularly if they hold stocks or merchandise, and reconcile it with their accounting records. Sales, purchases, and withholding schedules should be reviewed for accuracy, while supporting documents—such as receipts, invoices, and withholding certificates—should be properly organized and readily accessible. Payroll data, including 13th-month pay and other benefits, must also be verified against what was reported in Forms 2316 and 1604-C to ensure consistency across all filings. Tax compliance does not end with national taxes. Businesses are also required to renew local permits, pay local business taxes, and submit city or municipal reports, which are generally due in January 2026. Failing to meet these local requirements can result in penalties or delays in business operations. Completing year-end compliance tasks early lays the groundwork for accurate annual income tax returns. Calendar-year taxpayers typically file their annual returns and audited financial statements by April 15, 2026. Proper preparation minimizes last-minute stress, accounting adjustments, reduces errors, and lowers the risk of penalties or amendments. Taxpayers are advised to reconcile books, payroll records, and alphalists before the year ends. Keeping all supporting documents well-organized and easy to retrieve can save time during filing season. Seeking professional guidance can also help identify gaps or discrepancies early, allowing issues to be addressed before deadlines approach. In tax compliance, preparation is not just a best practice, it is a safeguard against unnecessary risks and costs. – Rappler.com ACG is the most trusted tax advisory firm in the Philippines, providing tax strategy, compliance, and policy advisory services to multinational corporations, foreign investors, and government institutions.

"When the Ayala Group announced on September 18 that it would stop selling Volkswagen (VW) cars in the Philippines, there was no love lost in the Philippines. Filipinos fell out of love with VW ever since the German car manufacturer veered away from its literal meaning — “volks” “wagen” or people’s car. VW had strong roots in the Philippines. The German car manufacturer, the biggest in Europe, used to have the largest market share here back in the 1960s. According to Klaus Schadewald, former chief operating adviser of VW Philippines, VW’s market share used to be 64%, meaning two out of every three cars in the Philippines was a VW. Even our police cars were VW Beetles at one point. VW once had three production plants in the Philippines, and Schadewald says the Philippines still has one of the largest VW clubs in the world. The Samahan VW Club of the Philippines, for instance, has around 30,000 members on Facebook. Those were years when Germany’s manufacturing-engineering prowess was on display all over the world, and VW would outsell giant American automaker Ford with their classic Beetles, Kombis, Golfs, Karmann Ghias, and Brasilias. A post shared by Volkswagen Philippines (@volkswagenph) Volkswagen’s two-door Beetle sedan sold over 21 million worldwide, “making it the most popular car manufactured off a single platform of all time,” according to Volkswagen AG. It also became a cultural icon during the “Hippies” counter-culture movement in the late 1960s and 1970s, with peace advocates bringing Beetles and Kombis to protests such as the Woodstock music festival in New York, USA. Like many middle-class Filipinos, our family once had a VW Beetle. My late father bought one in 1965, a pale-blue Bug, which he gave up three years later probably because it became too small for the growing family. In 1968, he sold it to my late mother’s close friend, the late Gregorio Catapang Sr., father of former Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief (ret.) Gregorio P. Catapang Jr. (2014-2015), currently the Bureau of Corrections chief. The Catapang family had it for 37 years, driven mostly by Greg Sr., a simple government employee who retired from the Securties and Exchange Commission, and his second son the late Dr. Jose “Joey” Catapang, a UP alumnus who taught physical education and human kinetics in some schools here before he became an overseas Filipino worker-teacher in Saudi Arabia. In 2005, I took an interest in restoring a Beetle and called Joey if anyone was still using it. It turned out the car was just parked in their garage in their modest family home in Project 6, Quezon City. And so I bought it from him for P15,000, and got a towing service to take it to my father-in-law Joven Reyes’ house in Antipolo City for P750. Daddy Joven, a car enthusiast and once a car rally driver, had already restored a couple of Beetles by then. I spent around P160,000 for the nine-month restoration work, free labor courtesy of Daddy Joven, who worked on the car from September 2005 until June 2006. I then gave it as a gift for my wife. She occasionally drove it to work to the then-National Economic and Development Authority in Pasig City. From pale blue to white, the 1965 VW 1300 became fire truck red. The seat covers were reupholstered into denim. The vehicle was restored with its original parts, including the large white steering wheel, the long stick gear, all the windows, the speedometer, and the leather safety handle on top of the glove compartment box. The only non-original parts I had to buy were the wheels, side-view mirrors, the fuel gauge, and one hub cap. It became my family’s second car, used mostly on coding days of our other car. Whenever I drove the car, I would occasionally encounter other people driving Beetles. I would learn that Beetle owners should honk the horn every time they had encounters on the road, and that this had become a practice among Beetle owners. It felt good being part of the Beetle community owners in the country. Many of them would show off their restored classic cars on weekends. The biggest problem I had with the restoration was not availability of parts (one could easily buy spare parts either in Banawe, Quezon City or stores in Buendia, Makati); it was in the registration of the vehicle. Since it hadn’t been registered for five years, it turned out that some bad eggs in the Land Transportation Office (LTO) used the registration details of the VW for another car. On record, the VW I had was registered as a Toyota! I don’t know how LTO resolved the issue, but fortunately, I was able to “restore” the car’s registration back to being a VW 1965 Beetle two-door sedan. My family had the 40-year-old Beetle for around 10 years. After Joey Catapang’s passing from cancer over a decade ago, I even drove it to his wake in Camp Aguinaldo. Greg Jr. was still Armed Forces chief of staff at that time, if I’m not mistaken. It was a “reunion” between Joey and the Bug he drove for some two decades. He had many stories about the Beetle, including times when the steering wheel would suddenly get detached but he’d still be able to put it back on and drive. He loved what he called the Beetle’s “aircon,” (even it had none) referring to its triangular front window vents and the pop-out windows on the back sides. When the car runs and all four vents are open, the wind flows well inside the car, providing natural cooling. A year or two after he retired from the AFP in 2015, Greg took an interest in buying the car, and since it was hardly being used, due mainly to it not having air-conditioning, I sold it to him. The Beetle was back to its second owner. This story is typical of many Beetle enthusiasts. The car has survived six decades or over two generations due to its quality and reliability. Unlike many of the luxury cars today, its parts are generally affordable and the car is easy to maintain — no computers needed. When VW returned to the Philippines via the Ayala Group in 2012, I was one of many Beetle enthusiasts who got excited, hoping that I’d get to buy the new Generation Beetle. But alas, when these cars became widely available in 2014, many were disappointed when they found that they were too expensive (price tag of around P1 million) even for the middle class; the modern Beetle was certainly no “people’s car.” The modern Beetle sold only 2 million units worldwide, and was retired by Volkswagen AG in 2019. Only a few thousand units (or less) were perhaps sold in the Philippines. It failed to win the hearts of people. As we are made aware of the lifestyles of those involved in the flood control scandal, such as the fleet of luxury cars of the Discayas (including a Rolls Royce), dismissed Department of Public Works and Highways engineer Brice Hernandez’s P12 million GMC SUV and Lamborghini, the classic VW Beetle provides us with symbols that are relevant today: simplicity as opposed to opulence; durability and smart design in contrast to substandard projects; a name that means serving people’s needs; and, its cultural history of being a symbol of protest against establishments that do wrong.

"MANILA, Philippines — With the 2025 midterm elections coming, consumption of information about local candidates is critical more than ever. The information we consume not only influences our voting decisions, but also shapes the leadership that will govern the country in the years to come. Members of the #FactsFirstPH coalition, including Rappler, Pitik Bulag, Explained PH, and News5, stepped up to promote voter empowerment and accountability. From informative comics to edutainment videos, these organizations leverage social media to amplify the #AmbagNatin campaign, which aims to empower voters ahead of the elections. Artist collective Pitik Bulag uses editorial cartoons and comics as tools for advocating for press freedom and the fight for facts. The group hosted a comic strip competition in the public art chat room of the Rappler Communities app to amplify the #AmbagNatin campaign. Public art chat room member Timothy Andrei Milambiling won first place for his artwork that highlighted the challenge of fact-checking among voters and the crucial role of media literate individuals in combating disinformation. His artwork also underscored the importance of community engagement in making informed choices. Second and third best artworks came from chat room members Fiana and Cesar Camba, respectively. Fiana’s piece highlighted widespread election bribery, while Cesar emphasized the importance of voting wisely for a child’s future. Another standout entry by user jascribbler depicted how fake news continues to mislead Filipinos, while shedding light on the need for countermeasures to ensure a fair election environment. Explained PH supported the #AmbagNatin project by unpacking the rise of deepfake and AI-generated videos. This edutainment video explains what deepfake and AI-generated videos are, how to spot them, and why fact-checking is crucial before sharing content online, especially as elections approach. Explained PH also released a comic on trolls and overseas voting, advocating against fake news and promoting voter empowerment. An illustration by jascribbler encapsulates the misinformation spread by online trolls which intensifies during elections. It reminds voters to stay cautious and rely on credible sources. User JKR’s illustration highlights the voting power of overseas Filipinos despite being far from home. It also serves as a reminder for them to register for the upcoming elections and stay informed about new voting methods. Rappler provides a comprehensive summary of key details for the 2025 elections, including updates on overseas voting. For the first time, overseas Filipinos will have the option to vote online. As part of the #AmbagNatin campaign, News5 tackled election surveys, explaining their relevance and common misconceptions. Through this video, it clarified that while election survey results provide insights into voter preferences, they do not determine election outcomes. Political analyst Jean Franco highlighted that election surveys reflect the voices of voters and play a role in democracy. This video also emphasized that surveys should serve as a guide, but voters must still think critically in choosing their leaders. Rappler’s #AmBAGNatin challenge in Pasig City gives voters a platform to share their views on candidates and key election issues. Participants draw questions from a bayong and share their thoughts on leadership and governance. The challenge also allows Pasig City residents to discuss how voters can contribute (ambag) to building a better future for the city’s youth. — Zebedee Custodio-Lucas/Rappler.com Zebedee Custodio-Lucas is a Rappler volunteer of MovePH.

"NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – For some 140,000 small sugar planters in Negros Occidental, this will not be a merry Christmas. Plunging local sugar prices have erased hopes of decent holiday earnings, leaving the mostly agrarian reform beneficiaries, facing a bleak start to the new year. On Thursday, December 18, millgate bid prices per 50-kilogram bag of sugar on Negros Island averaged P2,130 to P2,200, around P380 lower than the supposed production cost. Universal Robina Sugar Milling Corporation in Negros Oriental offered the lowest bid at P2,130 per bag, while First Farmers Holding Corporation in Talisay City, Negros Occidental, posted the highest at P2,292.19 per bag. Lucio Tan-led Victorias Milling Company, Asia’s biggest sugar refinery, maintained a steady price of P2,200 per bag, while the Jose Marie Chan-owned Binalbagan-Isabela Sugar Company offered P2,155 per bag. Current millgate bid prices are slightly below October’s average of P2,250, two weeks after 424,000 metric tons of imported refined sugar arrived in the country. Saul Casiple, a small sugar planter in Victorias City and EB Magalona, told Rappler on Friday, December 19, that he was severely affected by the declining prices. “It’s okay for the big planters because they have extra capital. But for us small ones, it’s truly pitiable,” he said. Last week, Casiple milled 50,000 tons of harvest for a total of P150,000. Milling costs amounted to P40,000, while planting and growing expenses – including wages, fertilizers, and pesticides – further reduced his income. “We’re really losing or even if we were in a break-even, still, it will lead us to look for additional capital in the next cropping period because part of our present income now has been allotted already for our food, among other expenses,” Casiple said. Expenses for a single hectare of sugarcane range from P80,000 to P90,000 for new plantings and P60,000 to P70,000 for ratooned crops. “Add the planting, growing and milling expenses – the current sugar pricing will not really compensate our overall spending,” he added. Mayors from 31 towns and cities in Negros Occidental have called for immediate government intervention. Cadiz City Mayor Salvador Escalante Jr., president of the Association of Chief Executives (ACE) in Negros Occidental, said the Marcos administration should not ignore the crisis, especially since the most affected are needy agrarian reform beneficiaries. Negros Occidental produces 60% of the country’s sugar but thousands of small planters and laborers are facing low or no income due to poor prices. Negros Occidental Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson urged stakeholders to unite and prevent further declines in sugar prices. “Together, let us act with firm determination to safeguard the livelihood of our farmers, workers and communities,” he said. Excessive sugar imports are cited as a primary cause of the crisis. The government imported 424,000 metric tons of refined sugar under Sugar Order No. 08 (SO8), which arrived in mid-September, surprising local producers. Sugar planters’ federations had requested only 150,000 metric tons. The resulting surplus is causing significant revenue losses. The Confederation of Sugar Producers Association (CONFED) reported forgone revenues of P4.2 billion as of November 23. With current prices, CONFED projects losses could reach P23.3 billion for Crop Year 2025-2026. Negros Occidental 5th District Representative Emilio Bernardino “Dino” Yulo III, a former Sugar Regulatory Administration official, said the pricing trend is “bad” for small planters, especially during the holiday season. He said the small planters’ primary concern is earning enough to cover daily expenses and pay field workers. Lower millgate prices make it difficult to cover fertilizer, pesticide, and labor costs, he said. “SRA should look into their plight,” Yulo said. “We feel them. We pity them.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Negros sugar planters face bleak holidays as millgate prices plummet,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/negros-occidental-sugar-planters-millgate-price-drop-december-18-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – In direct response to the rising cost of living and escalating consumer prices, the Department of Finance (DOF) is proposing significant increases in tax-free benefits and allowances for both private and public sector employees. The proposal aims to provide much-needed financial relief, improve labor conditions, and enhance social protection for Filipino families, but one question still remains: Will this at last ease the burden carried by Filipino homes? The proposal introduces substantial adjustments to several key monetary allowances. The non-taxable rice subsidy is set to increase from P2,000 to P2,500 per month (or its market equivalent). Similarly, the semi-annual medical cash allowance for dependents will be raised from P1,500 to P2,000. The DOF also seeks to hike the ceiling for actual medical assistance from P10,000 to P12,000 per year and increase the monthly laundry allowance from P300 to P400. Furthermore, the tax-free limit for meal allowance for overtime or night-shift work will be boosted from 25% to 30% of the minimum wage. Adjustments are also proposed for other essential and incentive-based benefits. The annual non-taxable threshold for uniform and clothing allowance will climb from P7,000 to P8,000. For incentives, employee achievement awards are set to increase from P10,000 to P12,000 per year, and the limit for Christmas or anniversary gifts will rise from P5,000 to P6,000 annually. Additionally, the combined tax-free ceiling for Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) and productivity incentives will go up from P10,000 to P12,000 per year. Finally, the DOF addresses leave credits, a vital component of employee compensation. For private employees, the tax-exempt ceiling for monetized unused vacation leave credits will be expanded from 10 days to 12 days. The current uncapped benefit for government employees’ monetized vacation and sick leave will be retained. The true legislative effort that will finally ease the financial burden on the Filipino family is the strategic, comprehensive reform to reduce the Value-Added Tax (VAT) rate from 12% to 10% combined with a significant increase in the income tax exemption threshold. The core advantages for Filipino families from this combined approach provide substantial financial relief: the 2% VAT cut immediately translates into a direct price reduction on goods and services, giving consumers savings (e.g., approximately P200 for every P10,000 spent) and restoring purchasing power. Crucially, the increase in the income tax exemption from P250,000 to a proposed P400,000 to P500,000 provides relief on the income side by making a larger portion of annual earnings tax-free, directly resulting in a higher net take-home pay. This two-pronged relief is particularly targeted to benefit the middle class, ensuring they keep more of the money they earn and pay less when they spend it, thereby maximizing the boost to the family’s overall financial health and security. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Ask the Tax Whiz] Beyond pampalubag-loob: What reform will truly give PH households relief?,https://www.rappler.com/business/ask-the-tax-whiz-department-finance-proposal-free-benefits-filipino-workers/,Rappler
"Batangas 1st District Representative Leandro Antonio Legarda Leviste posted on January 11 in his Facebook page the denial of Meralco PowerGen Corporation (MGEN) that it did not acquire any shares in Solar Para sa Bayan Corp., (SPBC) which was awarded a congressional franchise through Republic Act 11357. MGEN says it is not privy to any transactions of SPBC and that SP New Energy Corp., (SPNEC) business and operations are not dependent on that franchise. Leviste was reacting to Ombudsman Jesus Crispin Remulla’s allegation that Leviste sold SPBC’s franchise without congressional approval. This column is not an indictment of MGEN or its investment decision. It is a market analysis of how Leandro Leviste monetized regulatory confidence and political permission — rather than delivered capacity — to secure a multibillion-peso exit ahead of execution. By tracing how franchises, service contracts, and dynastic access were converted into valuation before megawatts arrived, Vantage Point examines how risk was shifted downstream to utilities, lenders, regulators, and consumers — and why the real issue is not who bought the platform, but how permissions became the product in Philippine clean energy. When questions surfaced about whether Leandro Leviste monetized political permissions rather than megawatts, the rebuttal was technical, precise — and incomplete. MGEN, it was said, did not acquire shares in Solar Para sa Bayan Corp. (SPBC), the franchise holder under Republic Act 11357. MGEN was not privy to SPBC transactions. SPNEC, the listed vehicle, does not depend on the franchise to operate. All of that may be factually correct, but none of it addresses the real issue. Infrastructure markets do not price legality alone. They price confidence. And confidence is built not only on contracts and balance sheets, but on the ecosystem of permissions that makes those contracts feel durable, expandable, and politically survivable. You do not need to sell a franchise outright to sell its economic value. You only need to convert the certainty it creates into bankable expectations — before delivery is required. That is what Vantage Point exposes. The transaction that defined Leviste’s rise was not a sale of electrons. It was the monetization of optionality. When SPNEC shares were sold in tranches to Meralco’s renewable arm MGEN — culminating in a ₱13.76-billion block sale in October 2025 — the underlying asset was not operating cash flow. It was a development platform: service contracts, land banks, permits, grid assumptions, and the belief that execution would follow. Markets understand this distinction instinctively. A power company is valued on what it produces. A development platform is valued on what it might produce — and on how likely regulators, lenders, and policymakers are to remain patient while it tries. This is where political capital matters, even when it is not formally transferred. Republic Act 11357 became law in April 2019 during the term of former President Rodrigo and which Leviste’s mother, Loren Legarda, witnessed before her term ended on June 30, 2019. So in timeline terms, the franchise that later became central to the Solar Para sa Bayan Leviste ecosystem was enacted squarely under the Duterte administration, not before and not after — an important contextual detail when assessing political backing, regulatory confidence, and the sequencing of Leviste’s business expansion. That alignment is not conjecture — it is chronological fact, and it explains why questions about political backing, regulatory confidence, and market optics persist regardless of later denials about ownership or dependency. Duterte did not have to sit on SPNEC’s balance sheet to shape its valuation. The law did something subtler and more powerful: it established that the Leviste ecosystem could move faster, broader, and with fewer obstacles than competitors. It signaled legislative comfort with scale. It normalized exceptional access. It lowered perceived regulatory friction, not just for one company but for an entire constellation of projects bearing the same name, leadership, and political lineage. That signal is what markets price. I am not making a conjecture. It is patently clear that such is observable behavior. From renewable service contracts to land acquisition to institutional financing, Leviste’s platforms accumulated scale farther and faster than physical delivery. By the time regulators disclosed that dozens of awarded contracts were facing discontinuance, liquidity had already been secured. The founder had exited at scale. Execution risk had moved — quietly but decisively — downstream. That risk did not disappear. It landed where it always does. It landed on the balance sheets of utilities now responsible for delivery timelines they did not originate. It landed on lenders financing long-gestation projects before revenue. It landed on regulators forced to revise planning assumptions when promised capacity failed to arrive. And ultimately, it landed on consumers, who pay higher power prices when cheap solar does not materialize on schedule. This is why the denial misses the point. Whether or not MGEN bought a franchise is immaterial. What matters is that it bought into a platform whose value was shaped by political confidence long before there was operational proof. The transaction priced belief ahead of performance. And once belief is monetized, the incentive structure changes. Urgency weakens. Accountability diffuses. Moral hazard becomes systemic. The problem is compounded — not softened — by Leviste’s pivot into politics. In a perfect world, reform credibility is earned through tedious work: committee scrutiny, legislative negotiation, budget discipline, and institutional reform that survives personalities. What markets discount is spectacle. When a public official adopts the posture of a crusader while standing atop unfinished infrastructure, investors do not see courage. They see volatility. Performance politics is not neutral in infrastructure. It widens regulatory risk premia. It slows approvals. It raises the cost of capital. And it makes foreign investors — already cautious about governance consistency — price in an extra layer of uncertainty. The irony is stark. A platform built on regulatory patience now faces the consequences of political theatrics that erode it. None of this requires alleging illegality. It requires only following the money, the timing, and the incentives. Leandro Leviste did not have to sell a franchise to sell its value. He only had to sell the confidence it created — before delivery, before enforcement, before the first megawatt arrived. That is the real reckoning this episode forces. If the Philippines is comfortable with a clean-energy market where the most valuable asset is not generation but permission — where exits precede execution and risk is socialized after liquidity — then this model will repeat. If not, then the fix is not rhetorical. It is procedural: faster milestone enforcement, harder performance bonds, transparent contract-level reporting, and a strict separation between political branding and infrastructure governance. This is because the country does not run on narratives. It runs on electrons. And until execution catches up with monetization, this will remain less a story of clean energy than a lesson in how power, timing, and permission can be turned into cash — while everyone else pays the risk. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] The Leviste solar saga – why markets should be worried,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-leandro-leviste-solar-energy-market-risk/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – An internal audit at the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) has flagged possible conflict-of-interest concerns involving Undersecretary David Almirol Jr. The internal audit comes after more than P1.5 billion in eGov-related contracts went to PLDT and its subsidiaries. A conflict-of-interest issue such as this, to put simply, questions whether the best choices for procurement were made for the most efficient use of the budget, or if people’s interests were prioritized the most. The eGov app is the government’s central mobile platform that consolidates national and local digital services. Through the app, users are supposed to be able to access business permitting, PhilHealth records, BIR services, PAG-IBIG transactions, eTravel registration, and more. In July 2025, President Marcos described Almirol as the one who personally wrote the app’s code. PLDT, which won at least eight e-Gov-related contracts since November 2023, has had a major ownership stake in Multisys since 2018, the software firm Almirol founded and led for more than a decade. Almirol, however, denied any conflict, saying the DICT also engaged other large service providers Globe and Converge, and that procurement is handled by another undersecretary. PLDT, for its part, said, “PLDT has followed all the appropriate processes, and we’re confident that any investigation will reveal the same.” Rappler’s review of Multisys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) found inconsistencies that make it hard to determine when Almirol actually gave up his Multisys shares. These raise questions about the truthfulness of the Multisys disclosures during Almirol’s transition into government. In some of the eight eGov-related contracts awarded to ePLDT beginning in November 2023, other PLDT-owned subsidiaries such as its mobile arm Smart and data center firm Vitro, or the parent firm PLDT itself, were named as co-contractors. These contracts were sealed when Almirol was already overseeing the rollout of the DICT’s flagship eGov app. Almirol took his oath as undersecretary of e-Government on August 4, 2022. These contracts included projects such as the deployment of the eGov app’s eLGU system, an online platform for acquiring business permits, managing the e-Government cloud services, and data center services. “It is a known fact that Undersecretary David Almirol is the founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Multisys Technologies Corporation, a privately held software engineering and digital solutions firm,” an internal audit report dated June 5, 2025 said. Considering this, the report noted that “a conflict of interest may arise” in the following circumstances: (1) hiring ex-Multisys personnel and 2) awarding contracts to ePLDT. At least one of the contracts referred to was awarded through a “negotiated procurement” process. This was a December 2023 contract worth more than P133 million given to ePLDT. A negotiated procurement is defined as one being “resorted to under extraordinary circumstances whereby the government directly negotiates a contract with a technically, legally and financially capable supplier, contractor or consultant. Negotiated procurement is allowed in cases of two failed biddings…” PLDT currently owns a 45.73% stake in Multisys — where it reportedly invested P2.15 billion in 2018. Of the 2018 PLDT investment, P500 million reportedly went directly to the owners of Multisys, Almirol included. At the time of PLDT’s 2018 investment in Multisys, the latter was expected to strengthen the digital initiatives of ePLDT, Voyager Innovations (Maya), and PLDT Enterprise. Almirol served as president and CEO of the company for over 10 years. He remained listed as president at least until a January 24, 2022 general information filing at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which Rappler obtained in the course of this investigation. Almirol disputed the audit’s findings. Citing data center contracts specifically, Almirol said, “Even before we came in, they were already using [PLDT] Vitro. We’re also using Globe’s MK [data center]. We’re also using Converge. It’s spread out. That’s why Globe and Converge have large contracts too. In fact, PLDT has the smallest share for data centers.” Rappler’s own investigation, however, unearthed inconsistencies in Multisys filings with the SEC. This raises questions over Almirol’s stake in the company. With Almirol at the helm, Multisys’ parent firm PLDT — including its ICT subsidiary ePLDT, mobile and connectivity service provider Smart, and data center arm Vitro Inc. — has since been awarded at least eight contracts involving the eGov app and related projects. The contracts total around P1.55 billion, according to documents obtained from the DICT procurement page. They are as follows, arranged by earliest to latest date: Rappler has reached out to DICT and Almirol multiple times to provide information on claimed eGov contracts with Globe and Converge. DICT is currently processing our freedom of information (FOI) request. Rappler will update this story once we have received the information. To Almirol’s credit, none of these contracts were awarded while he was still on record as owner or a member of the Multisys board of directors. Because of the company’s conflicting filings with the SEC, however, it is unclear when exactly Almirol divested his Multisys shares. Almirol took his oath as undersecretary of e-Government on August 4 2022. A review of Multisys’ submissions to the SEC reveals that the company filed its General Information Sheet (GIS) three times that year (2022). The first GIS filing — notarized on January 24, 2022 and received by the SEC at 8:41 am on January 26, 2022 — still listed Almirol as president with a 54.22% stake. A second GIS–notarized on October 27, 2022 and received by the SEC at 4:12 pm on November 2, 2022 — more than two months after he took his oath as undersecretary — still showed him as a stockholder with a reduced 49.21% stake. The third and final version, notarized on November 18, 2022 and received by the SEC at 3:30 pm on November 21, 2022 removed him from the stockholder list entirely. RA 6713, the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, requires officials to divest within 60 days of appointment. All of the three GIS documents listed December 29, 2021 as the “period covered.” December 29 is also listed as the actual date of the annual Multisys board meeting. The first GIS, filed in January 2022, was signed by Alex Erlito Fider, the corporate secretary of Multisys. The second, executed on October 27 2022, was signed by Faye Encarnacion Bautista, assistant corporate secretary of Multisys. Only a few days later, a third one, filed on November 18, 2022, was also signed by Bautista. Fider was still listed as the corporate secretary in the second and third filings. Section 9 of RA 6713, which concerns divestment of business interests by public officials states thus: “A public official or employee shall avoid conflicts of interest at all times. When a conflict of interest arises, he shall resign from his position in any private business enterprise within thirty (30) days from his assumption of office and/or divest himself of his shareholdings or interest within sixty (60) days from such assumption. The dates above indicate that Almirol was still listed as owner of over 49.21% of Multisys well after these deadlines required by law. The staggered updates also raise questions about the accuracy and timing of the company’s disclosures during his divestment period. After Almirol divested, as seen in the GIS filed by Multisys on November 18, 2022, Belen M. Al-Humayed took on a share percentage of 48.22%. A quick search shows that Al-Humayed is listed as owner of Bison Management Corporation, a licensed recruitment and placement company. Michael Toledo, the director for Government Relations & Public Affairs at Metro Pacific Investments Corporation, took a 1% stake. Meanwhile, PLDT’s stake grew to 50.68%. Incorporated in 2010, Almirol’s software development company Multisys made it to the headlines in 2020 when its app called Staysafe for the 2020 COVID-19 contact-tracing was flagged by critics as “borderline spyware.” The app was scrutinized for allegedly having intrusive and excessive app permissions. The firm’s listed clients include the Villar Group, Robinsons Bank, and Grab — among a claimed 2,000 others. It has also developed cashless payment apps for local governments like Manila and Cauayan City, as previously reported by Rappler. Responding to the criticisms then, Multisys would later remove the required permissions in January 2021 for GPS and Bluetooth. Multisys had a net income of P116.6 million and P42.7 million in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Majority of the revenues in these years were credited to “software licenses.” The company then incurred losses in 2022 and 2023. According to SEC financial statements in 2022, Multisys had net losses of P742 million. This continued in 2023 with net losses of P188 million. In 2024, Multisys finally rebounded with a net income of P209.5 million. As mentioned above, eGov-related PLDT contracts came starting November 2023. All eight contracts listed ePLDT as a co-contractor with PLDT itself or PLDT-owned subsidiaries, Vitro or Smart. In 2023 and 2024, the majority of the company’s revenues came from “managed services” followed by “system fees” and “software licenses.” Multisys explicitly states in its 2024 financial statement that it earned revenues from ePLDT in 2024 and 2023 for “managed services” totaling P514.6 million and P110.8 million, respectively. To date, the DICT procured “managed services” from ePLDT in 2024. In 2023 and 2024, Multisys also had other contracts with PLDT and Smart for consultancy and software development services. But these make up a smaller chunk of Multisys revenues, ranging from P0.04 million to P48 million. Prior to these ePLDT contracts in 2023 and 2024, the largest contract that Multisys had received from PLDT was a P158-million contract in 2021 with Smart for software development. Money had been flowing from PLDT to Multisys, but none matched the more than half-billion-peso contract (P514.6 million to be exact) that it received in 2024 for managed services. According to the ePLDT website, managed services refers to the “end-to-end support for technological infrastructure,” which includes services like cloud management and help desk support services. The DICT’s internal audit report said that while the “procurement has undergone the regular bids and awards process, the award of managed service contracts to ePLDT, given its ownership stake with Multisys, creates a strong perception of a revolving door.” Despite Almirol’s divestment, the audit suggests that the undersecretary’s past ties with Multisys, and by extension, PLDT, may give these companies an unfair advantage in terms of winning these multi-million government contracts. The audit said that the presence of these contracts “suggests that the officer is leveraging their public position to funnel government resources towards entities with which they have prior financial ties.” The audit added, “Even if no direct financial transactions occur, the goodwill generated or the strengthening of business networks through such decisions can be considered a form of personal gain.” Almirol, in an interview with Rappler, disputed the audit’s findings, claiming that other service providers of equal or similar size such as Globe and Converge have also received contracts comparable to PLDT’s. Publicly viewable eGov procurement contracts on the DICT website have not shown Globe or Converge data center deals, based on our review of the available contracts on the DICT procurement page found here. Almirol denied influencing procurement, saying he had “no control” over the bidding process. “I have no control over the biddings…there’s another [undersecretary] who handles biddings.” – with Victor Barreiro/Rappler.com",True,true,Conflict of interest?

"Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer: Please tell me what to do po. I am 36, a single mother with an 11-year old daughter. I am proud to say that my daughter and I have lived a good, meaningful life, with my not needing to depend on anyone except myself and the Lord. Seven years ago I met a good man, 39, never married, who professed his love for me. He knows that I am a single mother, and has shown love and understanding for my daughter. He is also a practicing Christian because of me. It would be perfect except for his mother. His mother says she cannot accept a single mother for her son. What will people say? At first I was very understanding and willing to wait until his mother could see how happy I make her son. I was sure any woman who loved her son would immediately welcome our relationship. Especially since her son (my boyfriend) has never had a serious relationship in his life. But his mother refuses to meet me, so the relationship has not moved. My boyfriend says he wants to live with me (and eventually get married?) but he wants to do it only when he is financially secure. Right now, because he shares a business with his mother (a family business, now run together with the mother since his father died), he does not feel financially insecure. I do not know what to do anymore. I am tired of waiting, and seven years is a long time. Please help. – Mariza Dear Mariza, Thank you for your email. As you say, seven years is a long time to wait, so perhaps now is the moment to explore some options. Let’s first consider the people involved in this drama: Your boyfriend (let’s call him Jay) is 39, single, still presumably living with his mother and obviously unwilling to take any major steps without her approval, despite his age. As a result, while he professes love and was willing to become a Christian, this limited show of independence has not extended to setting up house with you and your daughter, much less marriage. In a nutshell, his No. 1 priority is his mother, not you. Instead of encouraging her son to follow his heart, his mother gives greater importance to what “people” may think of a relationship with a single mother rather than the happiness of her son. In an effort to kill the romance, she refuses even to meet you. Your daughter is growing up, on the cusp of becoming a teenager, and daily more aware of everything going on around her. She will see you as a strong, independent and resourceful woman, but must wonder at your willingness to remain in a seven-year relationship with a man who lives permanently in the shadow of his mother and treats you both as of secondary importance. What is this teaching her about healthy relationships based on mutual respect and trust? Jay’s mother is happy with her son living at home, rather than with you, and unwilling to challenge her refusal to meet you. Jay’s preconditions for a deeper relationship with you — his mother’s approval and financial security — are highly unlikely to be met while she is alive and her life expectancy might well be measured in decades, not years. So where does this leave you? You could decide that the current situation is good enough and just enjoy whatever relationship you already have with Jay — in other words, decide that what you have shared for the last seven years you can continue sharing until his mother dies. Alternatively, and more likely given that you are tired of waiting, you could have a serious conversation with Jay and make clear to him that if he truly loves you now is the time to make you his No. 1 priority, set up house and build a life together. Of course this is a strategy with some risk since he may choose his mother rather than you, and so you should only pursue it if you are willing to live with a negative outcome. However, you are surely entitled to be with someone who is proud of you, willing to fight for you, and not asking you to live merely in the shadows while his mother pulls the strings. If he is not prepared to step up, then he doesn’t truly value you and you shouldn’t waste any more time on this lost cause. All the best, JAF Baer Dear Mariza, Thank you very much for your letter. While it may seem harsh, I agree with Mr. Baer that while Jay may love you enough to become a Christian for you, you do not know exactly how big a commitment that was to him. After all, unless this commitment put something on the line, like insisting he shows his love for you to all and sundry, it is nothing but show. Based on the letters we get from INC members who have fallen in love with partners not of their faith, I know letting others know they love this person means that not only will they be ostracized but so will the rest of their families. However, if all it meant was going to church with you every Sunday and Bible study every Tuesday for example, that conversion is as nothing. I am not trying to belittle his conversion, just hoping you realize that this is not as big a deal as his deciding you have waited long enough and it is time he makes “honest women” of both you and your daughter. It is also time to stop dreaming of being financially secure but to start working towards this goal — either by insisting on better terms working with his mother so he can feel secure or being willing to take a chance and work on his own. This is not abandoning his mother. This is giving her agency. And it is within her remit to still have him in her life and in their business should she decide to do so. You also feel truly loved because of his behavior towards your daughter. First, this is not necessarily a test of love. Any decent person would care for the children of the one he loves. True, there are men who may be so myopic that they cannot treat their partner’s children with decency and love, but you are too bright to fall for a man like that. More importantly, Jay is not that sort of man. I have no doubt he is as you feel: a decent human being. Where you might be a little shortsighted is the meaning of his other behavior: warning you that he cannot move forward unless his mother is happy with his choice and he is financially secure enough to marry you. I describe your unawareness as shortsighted as opposed to blind because already you have stepped out of the Fool’s Paradise you were living with him. Already you are questioning whether your relationship with and commitment to him is worth it. Well done! This shows you are not blind and thus can decide to cut him loose with less difficulty. I agree with you 100%. Seven years is a long time to wait for Jay to put his money where his mouth is: to show the depth of your relationship to his mom, and to be willing to give up the security of working in the business he has with his mom and strike out on his own if that is what she forces him to do. Look around you, dearest Mariza. Decent men are everywhere. But men who have achieved the developmental goals expected of his age — have a mature relationship with a partner or decide he likes living on his own AND have a job good enough to support himself and his family, even if both partners have to earn a living — are not. This is not asking for the moon. This is a realistic expectation of any woman worth her salt…as you are. Please do not feel you have wasted seven years. For seven years you have had the love of a decent man. It is now time for you to accept the love of a decent and mature man or to let the chip fall where they may: either with another man, or with your daughter and you, as you both have done so well in the past.

"“One of the great things about travel is that you find out how many good, kind people there are,” Edith Wharton once wrote. The first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, for The Age of Innocence, Wharton’s words remain true today. Travel not only reveals kindness in strangers; it also uncovers the outstanding stories people carry, tales of struggle, of creativity, and of quiet contributions to their communities that deserve to be told. Like many travelers, I began by focusing on the sights, the landmarks, the landscapes, the postcard views. But over time, as I met more people along the road, my attention shifted. I found myself drawn to the ordinary men and women whose lives, struggles, and small achievements revealed far more about a place’s Instagrammable spots ever could. The people I meet along the road — ordinary individuals whose lives offer fascinating insights — share stories that often get overlooked, yet they contribute to their communities and even preserve the country’s heritage. On a random stretch of beach in Paracale, Camarines Norte, we met Mang Bernardo, one of the town’s remaining magkakabud, solo gold panners who practice a centuries-old form of small-scale sand mining. On a good day, he told us, he might collect a single gram of gold, enough to sell for about a thousand pesos. The method he uses, known as gold panning, dates back to ancient times. With little more than sluices (an apparatus where flowing water traps gold), and shallow pans, practitioners sift black sand for particles of gold no larger than a grain of dust. Spending most of his days on the shallow parts of the beach. Mang Bernardo has grown accustomed to being told away. Some resort owners, he said, drive the few remaining magkakabud like him away. “We don’t even do this on their property,” he told us in Filipino. “We do it on the beach, during low tide.” To outsiders, his trade may appear extractive, even harmful to the shoreline. Yet Bernardo remains protective of his environment. Pointing to a stretch of sea, he spoke of fish and corals he hopes to rally his neighbors to protect. “That part over there,” he said, “should be declared a marine sanctuary.” He mines to survive, but he also watches over the waters that sustain him. “I inherited this job from my father, and he from his father,” he said. In Batac, no visit feels complete without a stop at the row of empanada stalls lining the street in front of the church. Among them, the oldest still in operation is Glory’s Empanada, founded by Gloria Aduana Cocson, now 82, who began making empanadas at just 15 years old. Over decades, Cocson refined her recipe until it became the town’s most popular offering, a benchmark of Ilocano street food. Her story, however, is not only about culinary craft. Left to raise seven children on her own, she relied on her empanada business to support her family, eventually transforming her small stall into a local institution. Today, Lola Gloria, as she is known, is recognized as one of Ilocos Norte’s most respected culinary figures, her work honored with awards including the Kalipi Award and the Gameng Lifetime Achievement Award. Her empanadas remain more than a snack; they are already a part of the province’s tradition, and the power of food to bring together both family and community. In the wheels of the tourism industry, it’s often the overlooked figures who keep moving the circular economy it produces. Among them is Buenvenido dela Cruz Jr., a 71-year-old river guide in Roxas City, Capiz. For more than 17 years, Dela Cruz has been a Department of Tourism–accredited guide along the Cadimahan River, in Roxas City, Capiz, where visitors drift through mangrove-lined waters on lunch cruises. His current life stands in complete contrast to his past. A fisherman since the age of 16, he once roamed as far as Palawan and Masbate, chasing bigger catches and, by his own admission, resorting at times to illegal methods such as dynamite fishing. “Fishing was all I ever knew,” he said. But by his mid-50s, his body could no longer endure the punishing work. When the local government began developing Cadimahan River as an eco-tourism site in 2008, he grabbed the chance to begin a new chapter as a tour guide. The earnings are modest. His income depends on the flow of tourist bookings, and he supplements it by working as a caretaker at one of the river’s fish cages, earning P2,000 a month. “The income has decreased significantly since the pandemic,” he said. Yet beyond guiding, Dela Cruz has become a storyteller eager to share the history of the river, the life it sustains, and the role it continues to play in his daily life and in the community he belongs. Maria “Oyog” Todi, a T’boli cultural ambassador and indigenous artist, founded the Lake Sebu School of Living Traditions in the 1990s with a singular purpose: to preserve her people’s heritage. “When our culture dies, our existence dies,” she said. Perched on a hill overlooking Lake Sebu, the school was built in the style of a traditional T’boli longhouse. Known locally as the SLT, it functions both as an informal cultural center and as a homestay. For a small fee, visitors can stay overnight, share breakfast with the family, and learn directly from Todi about T’nalak weaving, T’boli music, and traditional dances. Todi, a musician, chanter, and dancer, has spent her life teaching and performing. An awardee of the NCCA’s Gawad Gabay, among many other honors, she remains one of the most prominent figures working to keep T’boli traditions alive. In 2001, the SLT was formalized into the School for Indigenous Knowledge and Training, or SIKAT, expanding its reach to elementary school students and offering lessons in weaving, brass casting, theater, literature, and other facets of T’boli culture. “Preservation of culture starts with the family,” Todi said. On the still waters of the Sabang Mangrove Forest, guide Alfie Tejada greets visitors with easy confidence. Only in his 30s, he has spent 13 years leading tours through this 47-hectare preserve just beyond Palawan’s world-famous Underground River. “This river isn’t connected to the Underground River,” he explained, before launching into a successive stream of insights. Over the course of 30 minutes, Tejada described the role of mangroves in protecting coastlines, sheltering marine life, and sustaining biodiversity. Palawan, he noted, accounts for nearly one-fifth of the country’s mangrove cover, some 60,000 hectares out of the Philippines’ estimated 300,000. He pointed out various flora and fauna as the boat glided along, from fruit-bearing mangroves to the birds flying overhead. According to Tejada, a flash of blue signals a kingfisher; hopping softly in the shallows suggests a heron. Birdwatchers, he added, arrive before sunrise to see more. He recalled, with a grin, how he once tasted the mangrove fruit preferred by long-tailed macaques. “It was awful,” he laughed. “Best to leave it to the monkeys.” Proudly, Tejada frames his work within a larger effort. “This is a community-based tourism project,” he said. “Each of us has a role in safeguarding this place.” In Roxas City in Capiz, Jose Arcenas is rewriting tradition, one doll at a time. Through his brand, Lamumu, he threads a simple mantra into every stitch: “support lokal, build lokal, market lokal.” What began as a catchphrase has become the guiding force of a social enterprise. The dolls, hand-crocheted by single mothers, students, and even inmates of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, are far from ordinary toys. Each one is mythology in miniature figures drawn from Hinilawod, the epic of the Panay-Bukidnon, and from the darker corners of Filipino folklore, including the Capiznon tales of the aswang. Arcenas reimagines these stories with care. His mermaid, for example, bears little resemblance to Disney’s Ariel. Instead, she emerges from the precolonial tale of the Kapid twins, in which one sister is cursed to live as a mermaid. It is folklore retold in yarn. The collection is displayed at Casita Juan, a beachfront retreat conceived by Arcenas, an architect by training. Against the backdrop of sand and sea, the dolls stand as both art and archive, inviting travelers and collectors to engage with Panay’s cultural fabric. Along the abandoned rails of Lopez, Quezon, where makeshift wooden trolleys known as “skates” rattle over rusting tracks, backyard workshops exist oozing with craftsmanship. One belongs to Jesus Abatayo, Mang Jessie to his neighbors. During the long lockdown of the pandemic, when his small coconut store slowed, Abatayo began experimenting with the husks and shells he once discarded. “He just started shaping them into little things,” his wife, Avanceña, recalled. “Before we knew it, there were flowers, animals, even tiny houses.” What began as lockdown experimentation grew into an unlikely livelihood. From smiling faces to intricate miniature designs, his pieces sold for a few hundred pesos, have become fixtures in the community. A stroke survivor for more than a decade, Abatayo has done more than carve out an income. In turning scraps into items of beauty, he has shown his neighbors that reinvention, like art, often takes root in the most ordinary materials. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Meeting a ‘magkakabud, a river guide, and more off the beaten path",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/meeting-magkakabud-river-guide-people-off-beaten-path/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — Spanning fields, markets, kitchens, and tables, the slow and intentional rhythm of Filipino food often goes unnoticed — yet it is at the heart of it all. However, it is no secret that digital society has commodified food into picture-perfect content. The depictions we see on social media are curated, filtered, and packaged into trends driven by engagement. Every so often, an ingredient gets its moment in the spotlight, only to be replaced by the next viral flavor. Although “foodie” culture brings attention to what we eat, it often stops at taste and aesthetic. It only scratches the surface, but rarely reflects the deeper stories, histories, and systems that shape what is on our plates. This is the same idea that runs through two literary canons of Filipino gastronomy, Sarap: Essays on Filipino Food & Palayok: Philippine Food through Time, on Site, in the Pot, written by Doreen Fernandez and Edilberto Alegre, the two most enduring voices in Filipino food literature. Even after two decades since they were first published, the pieces remain relevant to how we understand Filipino cuisine today. What local ingredients do we actually know? Do we understand how the palengke operates, or where our food really comes from? Have we ever cooked with a lesser-known Filipino crop beyond the usual chopsuey mix available in our kitchen? These questions nudge us to reflect not just on what we eat, but how we engage with what we eat. And what better way to reflect on our food than revisiting the works of Fernandez and Alegre? Sarap & Palayok both reveal a clear message: Filipino cuisine has always been rooted in the principles of slow food — the very opposite of fast food — meals that are good, clean, fair, and conscious of their impact on people and the environment. These themes and legacies came to life again at the October book launch of the latest editions of the books by Exploding Galaxies in Karrivin Plaza. During a panel discussion, chef Stephan Duhesme of Metiz, Slow Food Negros advocate Reena Gamboa, food scholar Raymond Macapagal, and entrepreneur Bea Misa-Crisostomo shared reflections on how we can approach our cuisine more mindfully — not as something to turn into viral content, but to sincerely approach as a living culture shaped by our environment, community, and tradition. The most straightforward way to embrace slow food is to cook with ingredients that are native to our regions and in season. Doing so not only sustains their production but also protects the crops from disappearing altogether. Slow Food advocate Reena Gamboa stresses that when we stop using an ingredient, we contribute to its decline or even its extinction. She discusses the case of the native dayap, or Philippine lime. Known for its sweet aroma and tartness compared to the calamansi, the dayap has become increasingly rare in markets today. Without the demand for more variety of crops like dayap, farmers are forced to produce the crops that are more common and profitable. “The farmer will only plant lettuce because that’s the only thing they can sell at a high price. That’s not even food that they eat, which is unfair. We want good, clean, and fair food for everyone, especially for the farmer who’s the one planting it,” Gamboa explained. However, what is forgotten can still be revived. Through the reintroduction of forgotten ingredients and recipes, like the ones in the Ark of Taste catalog, there may be potential to rekindle demand. “If there’s a dish that uses dayap specifically — if we get reminded of that dish and we want to resurrect it — the demand for dayap will go back, the farmer will take care of it again.” Seasonality is also a cornerstone in slow food that is meant to be embraced, not ignored. Not only does this support farmers and agriculture as a whole, but it also uplifts the health of biodiversity as a whole. “The world of today says ‘everything must be available right now at the time that I need it and every day when the customer wants it’,” Gamboa said. “But naturally it is not so.” She cites that this is why we have practices like fermentation and jam-making — to preserve and reduce food waste during off-seasons. As such, it is only natural that we work with the timing of nature and work with the ingredients it has to offer at a given season. We are encouraged to incorporate native ingredients into our cooking, even if it is mixed with other influences. “The heart is still there — the local ingredient will show you who you are, that’s the Filipino in you that’s going to come out there,” Gamboa added. Exploring rare and even overlooked ingredients can help resurface forgotten dishes. The more you cook with these marginal elements of our cuisine, the better chance they have at making a comeback. Another important point in the panel is to view Filipino food through our own unique context, instead of measuring it against global standards or outsiders’ expectations. Raymond Macapagal, a UP Professor of gastronomy and food studies, explains that Filipino taste preferences are shaped by environmental and geographical factors bespoke to the Philippines, pushing us to adapt in ways that other countries do not experience. Why are we Filipinos fond of sour flavors when other countries might find it off-putting? Macapagal reframes this ‘unusual’ taste as a product of our circumstances and surroundings. He uses our love of unripe mangga as an example, theorizing that their sourness may be a vital source of vitamin C, or that acidic flavors might give a cleansing sensation to the body or serve as a natural preservative for food. He also highlights the batuan, a native sour fruit, as a fascinating case, wondering why Filipinos don’t wait for it to get ripe before harvesting it. Macapagal recalls a visit to Silay, where he discovered from a local that if batuan is left to ripen, it will be eaten by the bats first. “When you look at our taste [as a country], it is shaped by the landscape but there’s also this aspect of interacting or competing with other animals,” he reflects. “With the bats and the birds in Silay, we took it (batuan) already, and we have to find a way to appreciate it.” In the same way, chef Stephan Duhesme challenges the sentiment of Filipino cuisine being ‘too plain.’ In his view, simplicity is not a weakness. In fact, although seemingly simple, our flavor profiles can even be just as complex and layered as other countries in Southeast Asia. The problem is in comparison and standardization. Filipino food is actually “endangered of becoming simplified,” he warns, pointing out that we risk flattening the richness of our cuisine when we use other countries’ as a benchmark. Instead, the Metiz chef emphasizes the adaptability and customizability of Filipino cooking, which shines in how we make sawsawan or dipping sauces to pair with our meals. “I think we have to remember that we actually like to personalize our food to our taste to all very different varying degrees,” he says, which makes our taste complex. The instinct to mix and balance flavors to our liking just might be one of the quiet strengths of our cuisine. So next time we feel like doubting the depth of our local food, maybe we should reframe our mindsets. Instead of seeing it as inferior to global standards, we might begin to see our cuisine as shaped by resourcefulness, adaptation, and deeply personal taste. To tie it all in, the panel problematized the biggest challenge: the cultural and structural disconnect between consumers and the food supply chain, especially in Metro Manila. Entrepreneur and researcher Bea Misa-Crisostomo emphasized that marginal ingredients and the systems behind them are often ignored because they lack visibility. “Our weakness as a country is not being so cognizant of marginal things,” she said. “It’s not that we don’t value marginal ingredients, but we don’t think about them that much. It’s like out of sight, out of mind.” She pointed out a “broken thread” between farmers, palengkes (wet markets), and consumers that has to be bridged for a more secure food future. Although chefs and businesses like her organic store, Ritual, are trying to find solutions to the structural problems, she stressed, “No retail store, no chef can save the farmers.” Real change, she said, requires a collective effort from across sectors. “If we, as a country, really try to do it together and prop up our palengkes, prop up our small farmers, make it affordable for them to sell their own stuff and to sell a variety of things — connecting the karinderya (small eateries), the school system, government procurement. Then maybe these things can be in broader circulation,” she said. So next time you want to go on a real food crawl around the country, consider taking it deeper: rediscover a lost recipe, try out a rare native fruit, talk to the market vendors, and ask about where your food comes from. Curiosity and interest, after all, are a powerful start. In retrospect, the insights of today’s food experts echo back to Doreen Fernandez’s writing about Filipino cuisine and culture: “From field and river to market, from market to kitchen, then to the table, and finally to the savoring. We have tried to place food in context in its cultural setting. Filipino cuisine is an authentic facet of Philippine culture that invites methodical inquiry. On our tables, rich and poor, are mute — albeit aromatic — testimony to the blending of history and our landscape.” It may be easy to wonder why Filipino food is not “trendy” enough, but maybe it doesn’t always have to be. Classic Filipino food literature teaches us that at its core, Filipino food is meant to be enjoyed the way it has always been: slow, intentional, and rooted in our identity. – Rappler.com",True,true,Beyond ‘foodie’ culture: Reclaiming the slow soul of Filipino cuisine through food literature,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/literature-reclaim-slow-soul-filipino-cuisine/,Rappler
"Microsoft and OpenAI announced a restructuring deal on Tuesday, October 28, that frees the ChatGPT maker to move away from its nonprofit roots and likely go public so it can finance CEO Sam Altman’s ambitious plans to develop data centers and cutting-edge technology. The deal refashions the $500 billion company as a public benefit corporation that is controlled by a nonprofit with a stake in OpenAI’s financial success. In a livestream broadcast, Altman said an initial public offering was the most likely path for the company’s future, given how much money is needed to train and build AI systems like the one that supports ChatGPT. Altman and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki opened the livestream by outlining plans to shift OpenAI from a product company into a platform that lets others build their own tools, services, and businesses on top of its technology. “We can now take this technology and this user base and this sort of framework we’ve built and get the whole world to build amazing new companies and services and applications on top of it,” Altman said. The restructuring has been one of many initiatives under way at OpenAI, which is betting that its generative AI technology will ultimately transform the global economy. The moves have heartened OpenAI’s investors and business partners, including Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, who was asked about the news at a developer conference on Tuesday. “I wish back in the earlier days that we had invested a lot more,” Huang said. “If you told me that OpenAI is going to go public next year, I’m not surprised, and in a lot of ways, I think this can be one of the most successful public offerings in history.” Tuesday’s agreement removes major constraints on OpenAI’s ability to raise capital and secure computing resources from Microsoft that have been in place since the two companies forged their agreement in 2019. Once AI assistant ChatGPT exploded in popularity three years ago, those limitations sparked tensions between the firms. The discussions to restructure OpenAI started after Altman was pushed out of OpenAI temporarily. The episode in late 2023 highlighted how the startup’s unusual structure limited the power of its investors and business partners, including Microsoft. Altman will not get equity in the restructured company, an OpenAI spokesperson said, in a reversal from discussions last year that would have given him a stake. The spokesperson added there will be no changes to his compensation from OpenAI, which pays him some $76,000 a year. Altman said OpenAI has financial obligations of $1.4 trillion to help build roughly 30 gigawatts of data-center infrastructure over the next few years. Eventually, OpenAI would like to build a data center that can produce one new gigawatt of power per week, Altman said, without offering more details. Each gigawatt costs as much as $50 billion to build, and Altman said he would like to help bring the cost down to $20 billion. The new OpenAI Group PBC will function more like a traditional company, cementing Altman’s power and giving him more leeway to strike deals, raise money and shape the broader AI industry. Microsoft will not have rights to any consumer hardware produced by OpenAI, and no longer has the right of first refusal to be OpenAI’s compute provider. Even so, Microsoft will hold a 27% stake in OpenAI and remain a significant player in its future. OpenAI will continue to share about 20% of its revenue with Microsoft for years to come, people familiar with the matter said. Microsoft’s previous 2019 agreement had many provisions that rested on when OpenAI reached artificial general intelligence, and the new deal requires an independent panel to verify OpenAI’s claims that it has reached AGI, the point at which AI systems can match a well-educated human adult. Microsoft will still hold a stake of about $135 billion in OpenAI Group PBC, which will be controlled by the nonprofit OpenAI Foundation, the companies said. The Redmond, Washington-based firm has invested $13.8 billion in OpenAI, with Tuesday’s deal implying that Microsoft had generated a return of nearly 10 times its investment. Microsoft shares rose 2%, sending its market value above $4 trillion again. The deal keeps the two firms intertwined until at least 2032, with a massive cloud computing contract and with Microsoft retaining some rights to OpenAI products and AI models until then, even if OpenAI reaches AGI. OpenAI and Microsoft expect to end the revenue-share agreement once an independent panel declares AGI, but OpenAI can also make those payments later. Both companies declined to say when they expect those commitments to end. With some 800 million weekly users as of October, ChatGPT has exploded in popularity to become the face of AI for many consumers after OpenAI’s founding as a nonprofit AI safety group. As the company grew, the Microsoft deal constrained OpenAI’s ability to raise funds from outside investors and secure computing contracts as the crush of ChatGPT users and its research into new models caused its computing needs to skyrocket. The requirement that OpenAI exclusively rely on Microsoft for computational resources was among the largest sources of tension. “OpenAI has completed its recapitalization, simplifying its corporate structure,” Bret Taylor, the OpenAI Foundation’s board chair, said in a blog post. “The nonprofit remains in control of the for-profit, and now has a direct path to major resources before AGI arrives.” Taylor and other board members — including Altman — have the power to appoint and remove members of the PBC’s board. The OpenAI Foundation has a 26% stake in OpenAI Group and a warrant to receive additional shares if the company hits certain milestones. “OpenAI still faces ongoing scrutiny around transparency, data usage, and safety oversight. But overall, this structure should provide a clearer path forward for innovation and accountability,” said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments. Microsoft also said that it has secured a deal with OpenAI where the ChatGPT maker will purchase $250 billion of Azure cloud computing services. In exchange, Microsoft will no longer have the right of first refusal to provide computing services to OpenAI. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Microsoft, OpenAI reach deal removing fundraising constraints for ChatGPT maker",https://www.rappler.com/technology/microsoft-openai-deal-for-profit-company-october-2025/,Rappler
"Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic forced the country to go on lockdown for several years, many Filipinos have learned to be wary of the tell-tale signs that they’re coming down with a sickness — be it a case of the seasonal cough or cold. Years after the lockdowns were lifted, the same caution continues — especially with the occasional rise in influenza-like cases whenever the flu season rolls around. Workplaces and schools even advise their workers and students to stay home when they feel unwell or begin to develop cough or colds, as germs can spread quickly with a simple sneeze or cough. What more if it’s in a bigger public space with hundreds of people — like kids and senior citizens? All this said, here’s a quick guide to the proper etiquette for coughing when you’re in public. Let’s face it, we’ve all been in the situation where we suddenly get the urge to cough while we’re in the middle of a crowded area. It’s unavoidable, so the best way to go about it is to minimize the spread of germs as much as you can. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that you cover your mouth with a tissue when you cough, and then dispose of it right after. If you don’t have tissue, cough into your elbow — never into your hands or open air, infectious disease specialist Frank Esper, MD told Cleveland Clinic. And when you do let your cough out, make sure you are facing away from other people. South Australia’s public health department also advises against using cloth handkerchiefs, as these are not disposable and can even double as a breeding ground for germs. The next step is to sanitize your hands. According to Cleveland Clinic, our hands are how respiratory illnesses often spread — with bacteria growing with every other hand we shake and surface we touch. Head to the nearest restroom to wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, and if there are no sinks available, lather some anti-bacterial alcohol on your hands. The same thing goes for all the surfaces you touched right after coughing. Wear a mask if you feel unwell. This isn’t just for your own health, but for the safety of those around you, too. The CDC attests that helps prevent the spread of virus transmission from respiratory diseases by containing your own infectious particles, while also protecting you from breathing in that of the people in your surroundings. Unless your reason for going out in public is absolutely necessary, just stay home. This way, you can recover from your cough safely, and you can lessen the risk of passing it on to other people — especially individuals with weaker immune systems, like children and senior citizens.

"On Thursday, October 9, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Francis Lim apologized for citing a “fictitious” industry report that claimed the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) lost P1.7 trillion in market value in just three weeks in August. August was when President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. shared that just 15 contractors bagged contracts to 20% of all flood control projects nationwide. The chief of the corporate watchdog cited the fake figure during a speech at a Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines forum this week, where he also noted that investors were leaving the Philippines due to weak integrity. Lim has since retracted his statement, saying he fell victim to the fake report that was circulating within business circles. “I deeply regret any confusion or concern that my statement may have caused. My sole intent was to underscore the vital importance of integrity in our markets and the devastating impact corruption can have on investor confidence,” he said in a statement on Thursday, October 9. Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs Frederick Go, earlier on Thursday, dismissed Lim’s claims, saying that the SEC chief cited a fake report that has since been disowned by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) market intelligence unit. So, how much market value was really wiped out in the weeks Lim referenced in his speech? PSE president Ramon Monzon clarified that the PSE lost around P185 billion in market capital in those three weeks. The local bourse’s weekly reports logged the following market capitalization figures since Marcos launched the Sumbong sa Pangulo website: Despite the erroneous figure in Lim’s speech, Monzon agreed with the SEC chief’s sentiments that corruption has hurt investor confidence. “​​That being said, SEC Chairman Francis Ed. Lim is correct in assailing the level of corruption in the country, and its adverse effects on the economy and financial markets,” he noted. According to Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation’s chief economist Michael Ricafort, the PSE’s composite index PSEi declined by at least 5% since Marcos’ fourth State of the Nation Address in July. Waning business confidence also led the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to cut the country’s policy rate by 0.25% to just 4.75% in its latest monetary policy meeting, in a bid to reverse the fall. “The stock market has declined, and there are now fewer companies with expansion plans. Weaker growth means weaker demand and lower inflation,” said BSP Governor Eli Remolona Jr. Ricafort explained in an email to Rappler that the latest rate cut was one of the offsetting factors for the PSEi on Thursday’s trade. He emphasized the importance of boosting economic growth through monetary easing measures in order to make borrowing costs cheaper. This, in turn, will increase demand for credit to spur investments, employment, and other activities that will boost economic growth. In a Thursday press briefing, the BSP also called for what Remolona described as a credible resolution to the corruption scandal. BSP Deputy Governor Zeno Abenoja also mentioned reforms in the implementation of future national budgets that ensure projects are properly implemented. “We would like to see, for example, for the 2026 to 2027 budget, in the implementation, what is allotted for certain key items will result in full implementation of this project, less leakages. That would improve the outlook for domestic demand, and that could support the economy moving forward,” he said. – Rappler.com",True,true,How much market value did the PSE really lose amid flood control projects mess?,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/pse-market-value-lost-flood-control-projects-scandal/,Rappler
"Qilin, a ransomware group with a track record of intrusions against major entities around the world, claimed responsibility on Tuesday, October 7, for a hack on Japan’s Asahi Group Holdings, which disrupted production at the beer and beverage giant. Asahi Group’s beer-making subsidiary, Asahi Breweries, said on Monday that it had restarted production at its six Japanese beer plants on October 2. It first said it had been hacked on September 29. Qilin posted 29 images to its website on Tuesday of what the group claims to be internal Asahi Group documents. The group claims to have stolen more than 9,300 files, or roughly 27 gigabytes of data, according to the entry on its website. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the documents. Asahi’s European subsidiary referred questions to Asahi Group, which did not respond to an emailed comment outside of office hours. Qilin did not respond to a request for comment. Qilin operates a ransomware-as-a-service platform that allows malicious users to carry out hacks in exchange for a percentage of extortion proceeds. It first emerged in 2022 and boasts nearly 870 attacks, according to data compiled by eCrime.ch, a cybercrime research platform. The group was behind the June 2024 hack of British diagnostic services provider Synnovis, which officials said in June 2025 contributed to the death of a London hospital patient.

"CEBU, Philippines — At a funeral home in Liloan, Cebu, 31-year-old Krizza Espra searches for clothes, something decent for her children to wear in their coffins. Her arms bore visible scratches. Her face was blank, eyes distant, as if her body was there but her mind was still caught in the flood that took everything from her.

"What stands out immediately in the PrimeWater-Crystal Bridges transaction is not what is disclosed, but what is conspicuously absent. In Philippine capital-market practice, silence can be as revealing as disclosure — and here the buyer’s lack of submitted financial statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is itself a material signal that deserves scrutiny. From a governance and market-integrity perspective, Crystal Bridges’ failure to file any financial statements raises a clear red flag, even if it is technically defensible under a narrow reading of SEC rules. While privately held investment vehicles are not always required to publish audited financials in the same way as publicly listed firms, the moment such an entity acquires control of a regulated infrastructure operator with nationwide concessions, the disclosure bar rises — not legally by default, but practically, reputationally, and regulatorily. Water utilities are quasi-public assets. They sit at the intersection of consumer welfare, long-dated concession contracts, and systemic credit exposure. A buyer stepping into that role without any publicly verifiable financial trail forces regulators, lenders, and consumers to take solvency, funding capacity, and related-party risk largely on trust. The Villar family’s decision to walk away from PrimeWater is being framed as fatigue — too many complaints, too much politics, too little reward. But viewed through the full record, the exit looks less like exhaustion and more like a calculated retreat from a business that became impossible to defend in public, regulatory, and electoral terms. (READ: Voters in hardest-hit PrimeWater service areas decisively reject Camille Villar) PrimeWater did not implode financially. It imploded reputationally. By the time former senator Cynthia Villar told reporters on July 31 that PrimeWater had turned out to be a “bad investment” that “doesn’t earn much” and had become “just being used against us in politics,” the damage had already been done. An estimated six million customers were affected, many of whom were paying on time while experiencing dry taps. READ: [Vantage Point] Taps go dry with expensive, inefficient PrimeWater service A Rappler team had solidly documented that water shortages in San Jose del Monte and other areas were not works of fiction. Also, a Thomson Reuters Foundation report published in August 2023 via Reuters documented residents describing “murky” or unusable water alongside higher bills, plus complaints that fell “on deaf ears,” and it noted Commission on Audit (COA) scrutiny of several PrimeWater-related partnerships. The situation had turned into a ‘daylight nightmare,’ if there is such a word, that became a major campaign-stage issue. President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. had publicly acknowledged the complaints. The Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) had assembled volumes of documentation and openly cited lack of investment as the root cause. (READ: [Local Vote] In vote-rich Calabarzon, PrimeWater makes a killing) In utilities, that is the point of no return. More telling is that PrimeWater’s financial record contradicts the narrative of a money-losing venture, as the Villar family matriarch claimed. Its profits climbed steadily, breaching ₱1 billion as early as 2022. According to its latest financial statement obtained by Vantage Point, the company’s profits rose further by 2024. PrimeWater’s 2024 audited financial statements, signed off by Punongbayan & Araullo with an unqualified opinion, show a company that is capital-intensive but operationally cash-generative. Total assets rose to ₱42.37 billion, liabilities to ₱26.04 billion, and net income to ₱1.35 billion. More importantly, operating cash flows reached ₱6.08 billion, broadly matching the scale of reinvestment needs, with ₱5.85 billion plowed back into infrastructure. This is not cosmetic profitability; it is a utility throwing off real cash, albeit one that must constantly reinvest just to stand still. Yet the PrimeWater statements also reveal why the identity and balance-sheet strength of the buyer matter so much. Service concession assets account for ₱26.1 billion of carrying value — by far the dominant asset class. These are long-dated, amortized over 25 years, and economically viable only if financing remains stable, lenders stay supportive, and regulators retain confidence in the operator’s backers. Any question regarding the ultimate owner’s financial depth becomes a question about the sustainability of the concessions themselves. The accounting policy shift in 2024 — from the revaluation model to the cost model for property and equipment — adds another layer to this story. The retrospective restatement wiped ₱1.3 billion off assets, increased liabilities by ₱321 million, and cut equity by ₱905 million as of 2023. While this move arguably improves conservatism and comparability, it also underscores how sensitive PrimeWater’s balance sheet is to accounting judgments. In such a context, the financial capacity of the controlling shareholder is not a footnote; it is a risk mitigant. If the public will be kept in the dark about Crystal Bridges’ financials, consumers, investors, and regulators alike cannot assess whether the parent company can absorb shocks, inject equity, or refinance debt if assumptions proved optimistic. There are also softer but no less important signals embedded in PrimeWater’s numbers. Advances from related parties remain at ₱3.58 billion, and management fees of ₱350 million continue to flow within the group. Accrued expenses nearly doubled year-on-year. Fully depreciated assets worth ₱947 million are still in use — normal for utilities, but a reminder of capital-replacement risk. These are manageable issues under a transparent, well-capitalized ownership structure. They become more concerning when the new owner’s own financial standing is effectively a black box. Enter Crystal Bridges — and the discomfort deepens. The buyer’s financial silence is not illegal, but it is destabilizing. A holding company acquiring a nationwide water portfolio without publicly filed financial statements asks customers, regulators, and markets to accept a leap of faith precisely when trust is already depleted. This is the worst possible sequencing for a utility transition: service failure first, ownership opacity second. And then there is the baggage — unavoidable, contextual, and impossible to ignore. Lucio Co’s public record is not one of conviction, but it is one of persistent allegation. For more than two decades, across multiple administrations, his name has surfaced in smuggling and tax-related controversies. Former Philippine National Police (PNP) chief and now Senator Panfilo Lacson had spoken openly — if carefully — about long-standing suspicions, always underscoring the same refrain: no arrest without evidence, no warrant without a paper trail. Senate hearings, customs intelligence lists, and media reports repeatedly cited Co, even as cases stalled or collapsed for lack of proof. Courts ultimately ruled in his favor in major tax disputes. No criminal conviction stands as of 2025. That history matters not because it proves wrongdoing — it does not — but because it illustrates a pattern that regulators and markets understand all too well: businesses that operate in gray zones of perception accumulate risk even when they clear legal hurdles. Repeated allegations, even unresolved ones, raise the bar for transparency. They do not lower it. Which is why Crystal Bridges’ invisibility is such a poor fit for a water utility acquisition. PrimeWater is not a supermarket chain or a real-estate holding company. It is a monopoly service provider whose legitimacy rests on three pillars only: service delivery, investment discipline, and trust. The Villar family lost the first two in the public eye. The new owner has yet to establish the third. Put bluntly, this is not about whether Lucio Co is guilty of anything. It is about whether a sector — already bruised by underinvestment and political fallout — can afford an owner whose financial capacity is not publicly verifiable. When millions of households are paying for water that does not reliably arrive, the market does not care about legal technicalities. It cares about accountability. The deeper lesson from PrimeWater is not that privatization has failed. It is that privatization without sustained capital, transparency, and consumer-centric enforcement inevitably collapses under its own contradictions. Utilities cannot be run like political side-businesses or balance-sheet conveniences. They demand patience, visibility, and a tolerance for scrutiny that many conglomerates underestimate. If the Villar family exited because PrimeWater became a liability rather than an asset, the question now shifts to Crystal Bridges: will it confront that liability head-on or merely inherit it quietly? PrimeWater’s rising revenues amid documented service complaints are not, by themselves, a smoking gun. But in a public-utility context, the combination of (1) growing collections, (2) allegations of chronic service failures and ignored complaints, and (3) a change of control into an ownership vehicle whose financials are not publicly visible is enough to justify the sharpest, most pro-consumer regulatory posture. (READ: PrimeWater allegedly not paying contractors, water districts: ‘Dami ’nyong nabudol’) The deal may be legal. The deal may even be strategically sound. But until tap water flows reliably and clearly — and until the new owner stops operating like a ghost — the market should treat the transaction for what it currently looks like to the paying public: a transfer of billing rights, and not a restoration of service. – Rappler.com Click here for more Vantage Point articles.",True,true,[Vantage Point] PrimeWater’s sellout: A ghost buyer and a broken utility,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-primewater-sale-lucio-co-ghost-buyer-broken-utility/,Rappler
"BAGUIO, Philippines – At a gallery in Barcelona, images of the Cordillera’s mountains, rituals and faces now stand in quiet dialogue with Catalonia’s own story of identity. The Philippine Consulate General in Barcelona has opened a photo exhibition honoring Eduardo Masferré, the photographer whose lens captured the spirit of the Philippine highlands and whose life embodied the intertwined histories of the Philippines and Spain. The exhibit, titled Lights and Legacy: Contempla las imágenes inmortalizadas a través del objetivo de Eduardo Masferré, which opened on October 24 runs until November 21, at the consulate’s gallery on Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes. It celebrates National Indigenous Peoples Month by showcasing Masferré’s timeless photographs — portraits of Cordillera elders, scenes of rice terraces, rituals and village life — works that have become visual testaments to indigenous dignity and endurance. “Our family is deeply honored to see Eduardo Masferré’s photographs celebrated in Barcelona. Having been raised in Sant Feliu de Guíxols, Spain always held a special place in his life. His work was a lifelong tribute to the dignity and spirit of the Filipino people, and seeing his images return to the land of his childhood reminds us that art, like love, bridges nations and generations,” the Masferré family said in a message shared with Rappler. Eduardo Masferré (1909-1995) was born in Sagada, Mountain Province, to a Spanish-Catalan father and a Kankanaey mother. His father, Jaime Masferré, had come from Spain as a soldier, while his mother, Mercedes Langkew, was from the uplands of Sagada. (Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article misstated that Jaime Masferré came from Spain as a teacher. This has been corrected.) Their union symbolized the convergence of two worlds, and Eduardo grew up between them — educated in Spain, rooted in the Cordillera, and fluent in both cultures’ ways of seeing. Returning to Sagada in the 1921, Masferré began photographing his community — not as an outsider but as a son documenting his own people. Over the next two decades, he created a visual chronicle of the Cordillera that would later define ethnographic photography in the Philippines. (Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article misstated that Eduardo Masferré returned to Sagada in the 1930s. This has been corrected.) His grandson, Albert Masferré, speaking at the exhibit opening, reflected on this interwoven heritage: “What makes tonight even more meaningful is that we are gathered here in Barcelona, the homeland of his father. In many ways, my grandfather’s own life was a bridge between Spain and the Philippines, between past and present, between two cultures that met in him and found expression through his lens. It feels fitting that his story should return here, across generations, to be shared with a new audience.” From Bontoc to Kalinga, from Ifugao to the remote villages of Abra, Masferré carried his camera with patience and reverence. His portraits — such as the iconic image of Lakay Kabayo, an elder’s face etched with time and pride — captured not just individuals but the collective soul of a people in transition. His landscapes, too, spoke of harmony between human hands and the highland earth: terraces carved like verses, rituals framed by mist. “Eduardo Masferré was a quiet man,” Albert said, “but through his camera he gave voice to a whole culture. His photographs are not just art; they are memories. They are testimony. They remind us that identity is carried not only in history books, but in the faces, rituals, and landscapes of a people.” First exhibited in his modest studio in Bontoc, Masferré’s work later reached the Cultural Center of the Philippines and traveled to cities including Copenhagen, Tokyo, and Arles. In 1992, his solo show at the Smithsonian’s Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC, cemented his place as one of the Philippines’ most significant visual chroniclers. The Smithsonian now holds part of his archive — a rare honor for any Filipino photographer. Masferré’s photographs were more than aesthetic achievements; they were anthropological records. His long friendship with American anthropologist Harold Conklin, which began in 1946, reflected a shared mission to document the Cordillera’s material and spiritual culture before modernity reshaped it. Using early photographic methods such as calotype and silver-gelatin printing, Masferré developed his work with meticulous care, treating photography as both art and science. Through his lens, indigenous life — often misunderstood or marginalized — became visible with dignity. He photographed not for spectacle but for remembrance, leaving an archive that scholars, artists and Cordillerans continue to draw from. As Albert reminded those in attendance, the legacy of Masferré’s work transcends his own name. “These images do not only belong to our family. They belong to the Cordillera communities whose lives he captured with respect and intimacy. They belong to the Filipino people. And tonight, in this place, they belong to the wider world.” Three decades after his death, Masferré’s images return to Spain — not as colonial artifacts but as shared heritage. In Barcelona, visitors walk among the faces of Sagada elders and Ifugao farmers, their presence reminding viewers that culture transcends borders. “I hope that as you walk through this exhibition, you will see more than photographs,” Albert said in closing. “I hope you will feel what my grandfather felt — the strength, resilience, and humanity of the people of the mountains, the Igorot people.” In these portraits, one sees not just the Philippines or Spain but the enduring human quest for identity, belonging and respect. It stands as a bridge between two histories — and as a tribute to a man who, through his camera, helped the world see the mountains and their people not as distant subjects, but as kin. – Rappler.com",True,true,Bridging worlds through the lens of Eduardo Masferré,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/eduardo-masferre-cordillera-photo-exhibit-spain-2025/,Rappler
"BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – Few things unite people the way food does. And in Baguio on Thursday, October 2, it was pasta — enough to feed 15,000 people — that brought chefs, students, and the community together at Pasta Mania: An HRAB Pasta Festival at the SM City Baguio Atrium. The giant pasta celebration opened the 18th Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourism (HRT) Month and the 16th National Food Showdown (NFS)–Regional, setting a deliciously festive tone for the city’s hospitality industry. “This is not just about pasta,” said Baguio Vice Mayor Faustino Olowan during the opening program. “Events like this highlight hospitality. Food is meant to be shared. Prosperity and success mean more when it is shared with others, when it is enjoyed by the whole community.” With a 28-foot pan divided into 16 sections, the chefs cooked 2,800 kilos of assorted raw pasta — translating into 5.6 tons once combined with local and imported ingredients. The recipe list read like a festival itself: 100 kilos of fresh tuna, 300 liters of olive oil, 300 kilos of pork lengua, 150 kilos of chicken, 50 kilos of kiniing, 20 kilos of etag, 500 cans of Spanish sardines, 150 kilos of cheese, 80 kilos of sun-dried tomatoes, 30 kilos of pesto leaves, and even Cordilleran hamonado longganisa. “This year, we wanted to spotlight not only flavor but also the way we, Cordillerans, cook — slow, patient, and layered,” said chef Rodin Raoul Florendino, one of the chefs-in-charge alongside chef Arthur Nucaza. Hotel and Restaurant Association of Baguio (HRAB) chairman Jeffrey Ng opened the festival with a short history of pasta’s global roots — from ancient Etruscans to Arab traders — before presenting the unique Cordilleran spin of today’s menu. Participating hotels and restaurants each brought their signature dish: For many festival-goers, it was a one-day passport to the Cordillera’s culinary ingenuity. Brian Galang, a local resident who attended last year’s giant fried rice cook-off, said, “I’m excited to try the different pasta dishes!” The event also highlighted HRAB’s community work, recognizing its scholars from eight local colleges and universities — future chefs and hoteliers whose education is supported by HRAB. “This festival reflects HRAB’s story,” said Anthony de Leon, HRAB president and general manager of Baguio Country Club. “From our beginnings to now, it’s always been about uplifting our industry while giving back to the community.” The SM Atrium brimmed with aromas of garlic, herbs, slow-cooked meats, and the earthy smokiness of kiniing and etag — proof that even an Italian staple can feel at home in the Cordillera. Pasta Mania served as both a communal table and a prelude to the rest of the 18th HRT Month festivities happening October 9-11 at Baguio Country Club. As Olowan reminded the crowd, “Food tastes best when shared.” Judging by the smiles and the giant 28-foot pan of pasta, Baguio started its HRT Month the best way it knows how — together. – Rappler.com",True,true,5.6 tons of pasta with unique Cordilleran spin bring Baguio together,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/tons-pasta-unique-cordilleran-spin-bring-baguio-together/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — Takoyaki lovers in the north, rejoice! Japanese takoyaki chain Gindaco has opened its second branch at SM North Edsa, Quezon City, in October, a few months after opening its first one at SM Mall of Asia. Executive chef and Gindaco Philippines’ franchise partner Jun Watanabe decided to bring the popular street food chain after his own personal experiences of eating Japanese food in the country. “On my YouTube channel, I used to rate ramen in the Philippines. Some of them were masarap (delicious). I could be satisfied. But I never found a takoyaki shop that satisfied my happiness. So I wanted to bring the best of our quality takoyaki here,” the Japanese chef shared during the chain’s launch in July. Another experience that he drew inspiration from when bringing Gindaco to the country is his time as a cabin crew translator for Philippine Airlines, reminding him of the stoic customer culture that he’s used to in Japan. “Of course, the flavor is important, but what matters just as much is the fusion of two cultures — the best of Filipino and Japanese values coming together. I believe that’s what makes Gindaco Philippines truly special, and it’s the heart of what we’re trying to create.” “Everything is from Japan. Our concept is like [the stores] in Japan, and we want to bring [it] here in the Philippines. Without flying [to] Japan, you can enjoy [it] here,” Watanabe told Rappler. Watanabe also went back to Japan in order to perfect the cooking techniques, taking from the store’s mantra that no takoyaki sits for more than 15 minutes. After being personally trained by Gindaco chefs in Japan, he brought his knowledge to the Filipinos so they can recreate the dish from these Philippine branches. All ingredients, machinery, and tools are imported from Japan. The takoyaki store has four flavors on its menu, including a Philippines-exclusive Triple Cheese (P329) that puts torched mozzarella, red cheddar, and parmesan as a rich topping. Original (P199) is the store’s take on the classic street food that’s topped with their signature sauce, dried seaweed, and bonito flakes, while Teritama (P249) adds cool and chunky egg salad on top of freshly cooked takoyaki. Mentai Cheese (P319) mixes melted cheese with mentaiko sauce, made by mixing cod roe and Japanese mayonnaise together. Gindaco is a Japanese takoyaki food chain founded by Sase Morio under Hotland Co. Its first store opened in 1997 in the Gunma prefecture. Morio formulated the recipe for the street food while he was searching for products to feature in his fast food chain called “HotLand.” Up to this day, Gindaco’s branches use the same recipe. Aside from 300 stores across Japan, Gindaco has branches in other countries like Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Indonesia. – Steph Arnaldo and Juliana Chloe Gonzales/Rappler.com Juliana Chloe Gonzales is a Rappler intern studying AB Communication Arts at De La Salle University.",True,true,Japan’s takoyaki chain Gindaco opens second PH branch,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/japan-takoyaki-gindaco-second-metro-manila-branch/,Rappler

"MANILA, Philippines – The team of upcoming romantic comedy film The Last Resort, which stars Daisy Ridley and Alden Ehrenreich and is being shot in the Philippines, paid a courtesy call on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in Malacañang on Wednesday, May 21. Ridley and Ehrenreich — known worldwide as Star Wars heroes Rey Skywalker and the young version of Han Solo, respectively — are set to lead a prominently Filipino cast for their latest project, shot in the Philippines and directed by Donald Petrie, the man behind hit films Miss Congeniality, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, and Grumpy Old Men. According to a Variety report, The Last Resort is about a hotel executive who goes to the Philippines to look for a resort location, and along the way meets an expatriate charter pilot. Joining the pair in the cast are a who’s who of Philippine entertainment, like Tonton Gutierrez, Mylene Dizon, Tetchie Agbayani, and Fil-Am stand-up comedian Jo Koy. Marcos praised the film upon being shown a few minutes of finished scenes by The Last Resort production team, saying they “hit all the high spots.” “It’s all terribly exciting for all of us,” he said. “Thank you for coming to the Philippines, hopefully helping us project the Philippines to the world the way Filipinos see our own country.” The President added that the Philippines is a “natural film location,” referencing the 1979 Francis Ford Coppola hit war film Apocalypse Now, which filmed several scenes in the country. Other major Hollywood films that also featured the Philippines are The Bourne Legacy and Avengers: Infinity War. Filipino business magnate Manny V. Pangilinan, and producers Ernesto “Bong“ Sta. Maria Jr. and Raja Collins joined Petrie and the rest of the cast in the courtesy call. Ecstatic in meeting Ridley and Ehrenreich, Marcos is also in all likelihood a Star Wars fan, having once cosplayed as a Jedi Knight to celebrate “Star Wars Day” or “May the Fourth.” – Rappler.com",True,true,"‘The Last Resort’ stars Daisy Ridley, Alden Ehrenreich, team pay call on Marcos",https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/daisy-ridley-alden-ehrenreich-the-last-resort-malacanang-call-marcos/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Art, literature, and their impact can outlive their creators. Over the decades, the efforts of the Maningning Miclat Art Foundation, Inc. (MMAFI) have proven this true. The foundation was established in 2001, a year after award-winning novelist Dr. Mario Miclat and Alma Miclat lost their daughter Maningning. The Filipina painter, poet, interpreter, and teacher was only 28 years old. “May kasabihang ang pighati ay parang dagat na ang mga alon ay taas-baba. Kung minsa’y tahimik, mapayapa; minsa’y marahas, nakakalula. Ang puwede lang natin gawin: sa agos na ito’y matutong lumangoy,” Alma Miclat shared. (They say that grief is like the sea, waves rising and falling. Sometimes it’s calm, peaceful; other times, it’s violent and overwhelming. The only one thing we can do is to learn to swim and brave the current.) And so the couple adapted to the current, as they transformed their pain into power with MMAF, a non-profit organization established in their daughter’s honor to empower the next generation of artists and poets. This includes the biennial Maningning Miclat Poetry Awards, which had recognized many budding talents. Dr. Mario passed away in 2021 at the age of 71. But Alma continued the foundation’s work as its president with the help of their other daughter Banaue. This year, MMAFI held “Alaala/Alang-alang sa Sining 2025,” a joint event of the Maningning Miclat Poetry Awards and the launch of the special coffee book edition of Mario Miclat’s Secret of the Eighteen Mansions. The novel, which was long-listed for the 2009 Man Asian Literary Prize, recounts the years the family spent in China. It includes an introduction written by National Artist Virgilio Almario, who is a close friend of the couple. He describes it as “one of the most creative histories of the rise and fall of the Maoist movement in the Philippines.” While revisiting past works with the novel’s newest edition, MMAFI also recognized the work of young artists, including Tresia Traqueña (winner, Filipino poetry category) and Vince Raphael Agcaoili (winner, English poetry category). “Today is really a celebration, a celebration of lives well-lived,” said Alma. “Kaya tayo nagbibigay ng tribute sa aking mag-ama. Inaalaala natin sina Mario at Maningning, at ang pagbibigay-pugay sa kanila ay alang-alang sa kanilang naiambag sa sining.” (That’s why we give tribute to my husband and daughter.

"MANILA, Philippines – Columnist and longtime Ateneo de Manila University professor Queena Lee-Chua, known for her contributions to mathematics education, psychology, and science communication in the Philippines, died on November 26. She was 59. Her son, Scott Lee-Chua, confirmed her death in a Facebook post. Her wake will be held at the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception, Gonzaga Hall, Ateneo de Manila University, from December 5 to 8, 10 am to 9 pm. Lee-Chua was a respected academic who taught mathematics and psychology at Ateneo for decades. She was also widely recognized as a columnist for the Philippine Daily Inquirer, where she wrote extensively on education, learning, family life, and social issues. “She was a proponent of problem solving in mathematics from the basic education to college levels, a mental health advocate, a good listener, columnist, writer, and an outstanding teacher with a larger-than-life presence both inside and outside the classroom,” the Ateneo Department of Mathematics said in a social media post. Anvil Publishing also paid tribute to the well-respected educator. “A leading voice in math and science education, learning psychology, parenting, and youth studies, Dr. Queena dedicated her career to helping Filipino students and families thrive. She also led research teams on the best practices of high-achieving Filipino learners and the media habits of Filipino youth,” the publishing firm said. A top-performing scholar, Lee-Chua graduated summa cum laude with a BS Mathematics degree from Ateneo. She went on to earn a master’s degree in Counseling Psychology and a doctorate in Clinical Psychology from the same university.

"MANILA, Philippines – Striking, bold, luxurious. Three Filipino designers turned chocolate into couture at the recent Philippine Fashion Week x Toblerone runway show at the Ayala Museum. The show, themed “Diamond Heist,” brought together esteemed fashion designers Jerome Salaya Ang, Ram Silva, and Jaggy Glarino to create exclusive five-piece collections inspired by the new Toblerone Truffles, diamond-shaped pralines with the brand’s signature milk chocolate and honey-almond nougat. “We’ve always dedicated our platform to Filipino designers who are unafraid to challenge convention, and the Never Square campaign is a bold declaration of that shared vision,” says Nikky Nicandro, chief vision officer of Philippine Fashion Week. “We were thrilled to give our designers the freedom to interpret this philosophy, resulting in a display of local artistry that is distinctly bold, luxurious, and ready for the global stage,” he added. This collaboration marks the brand’s first innovation beyond its iconic triangle shape, inspiring the designers, along with lookbook photographer BJ Pascual, to think completely outside the box. Each designer offered a unique take on indulgence and transformation. “I created a personality that is both soft and feminine, while also being fierce and feisty,” Jerome Salaya Ang shared with Rappler after the runway show. His inspiration follows the flexible form of chocolate — it could either be silky smooth or multi-faceted like a diamond. For him, Never Square meant embracing a state of transformation. His designs featured flowy fabric, sculpted organza, and leather ensembles. His standout piece is a diamond-cut patterned cocoon top and pants. Ram Silva, meanwhile, celebrated feminine mystery and elegance with his designs using intricate embellishments and a palette of deep plum and maroon. His pieces were perfected by the gold flakes and accessories worn by the models. Jaggy Glarino’s collection explored architectural elements blended with earthy and copper tones, resulting in sculptural yet dynamic pieces. His signature look is a spiral pattern dress with a deconstructed vest. “I was drawn into rough edges for this collection, but I contrasted it with fluid and velvety drapes. I wanted it to be sharp and bold while still feeling luxurious,” he said. The fashion show’s guests, including personalities BJ Pascual, Liz Uy, and Janine Gutierrez, flaunted their own Never Square looks. Pascual, who photographed the official lookbook, said the collaboration challenged him to merge fashion’s artistry with product storytelling. “For this shoot, we featured a lot of geometric shapes and I played on wide, low angles to give it a bold, but fun and bright vibe,” he shared. “It was exciting because it’s both a fashion and a commercial shoot and that doesn’t come very often.” Uy, a stylist herself, also shared her thoughts about the collections. “It’s all about the silhouette, texture, shape, and the embellishments that you can see. I loved the show and it was very interesting to see the chocolate worn by the models,” she said. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Filipino designers reinvent runway with food, fashion",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/filipino-designers-reinvent-runway-food-fashion/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Porac, Pampanga Mayor Jaime “Jing” Capil has been ordered arrested by a court for a criminal graft case in connection with the raided Lucky South 99 compound in his town. The warrant was issued by the Pasig City Regional Trial Court on Friday, November 28. As of posting Monday, December 1, the Philippine National Police (PNP) was still locating Capil to serve the warrant. The bail is set at P90,000 for seven counts of graft. Capil posted bail on Tuesday, December 2, and secured temporary freedom. Capil has been charged with violating Sections 3(e) and 3(j) of the anti-graft law, which prohibit granting government permits to entities not qualified to it, and causing undue injury to the government. Capil is accused of granting permits to the Lucky South 99 POGO (Philippine offshore gaming operator) despite allegedly being aware of suspicious activities there. Lucky South’s officer, Cassandra Ong, and Harry Roque, who helped Ong renew their POGO license, are both evading their warrants for human trafficking. Ong has gone into hiding, while Roque is seeking asylum in The Netherlands — his application now referred to Austria, which granted him his Schengen visa. He is claiming that the charges are political persecution. Capil was reelected mayor of Porac in the May midterm elections, although his hold on the office is precarious due to legal hurdles stemming from the same case. The Ombudsman has disqualified him from public office, and a division of the Commission on Elections has declared his votes stray. He has been appealing these decisions, which have allowed him to maintain the status quo. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Porac, Pampanga Mayor Jing Capil ordered arrested for graft",https://www.rappler.com/nation/porac-pampanga-mayor-jing-capil-ordered-arrested-graft/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Audit (COA) flagged the Social Security System (SSS)’s failure to collect the entire P93.747 billion in unpaid or unremitted premium contributions from employers. State auditors discovered that the state insurer has only collected 4.89% or only P4.58 billion out of the total outstanding balance. This leaves at least P89.17 billion that are yet to be collected from 420,627 employers. COA said that this has a direct impact on the agency’s ability to carry out its mandate, adding that it “deprives SSS of much-needed funds for the timely delivery of social security protection, claims, and benefits, to its members and their beneficiaries.” It also pointed out that majority of these employers — at least 349,189 — did not avail of the installment plan offered by SSS, practically ignoring the government’s efforts to help them fulfill their obligation. Meanwhile, at least 70,975 employers were tagged as “inactive, under temporary suspension, or with closed/dormant accounts” which totaled P25.774 billion. SSS said it cannot force employers to pay and blamed the delay in cases filed before courts against delinquent employers. These factors also include the non-apprehension of company leaders as well as the changes in judges. Among the factors it blamed for the delay are non-apprehension of company executives, dilatory tactics being employed by the counsel of defendant companies, and the retirement, transfer or promotion of judges who are handling the cases. These huge amounts of uncollected payments exist in the face of another increase in contributions of private sector workers scheduled by January 2025. Despite this, it is stated in the Social Security Act of 2018 that failure to remit contribution “shall not prejudice the right of the covered employee to the benefits of the coverage.” COA, however, stated that this weak performance in collecting premium would require SSS to exert more effort to pay for benefits. – Rappler.com",True,true,COA hits SSS’ continued failure to collect P89-billion contributions from employers,https://www.rappler.com/nation/commission-audit-hits-social-security-system-continued-failure-collect-contributions-private-employers/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Pasta has always been a staple in Filipino celebrations, from birthdays to fiestas and Christmas gatherings. And while most households stick to the familiar trio of sweet-style spaghetti and a glass of soft drinks or iced tea, Chef Wado Siman wants Filipinos to look beyond the usual pairings. That idea took shape in a tasting menu he curated for a pairing event last October at Brutal by Wadoughs in Quezon City. Siman, a self-taught chef with a communication degree, eventually found his way into the culinary world through experimentation and storytelling — a mix reflected in his dishes. Aside from Brutal, he owns Wadoughs, a cake studio in Maginhawa, Quezon City known for creative pastries. He is also the co-owner and executive chef of Atina Café in Fairview, Quezon City. Through his cooking vlog series KAYA sa Kusina!, he merges his backgrounds in communication and cooking by breaking down recipes in a fun, accessible way. For this menu, Siman crafted five dishes — each with a different pasta style — that leaned into Filipino flavors, but were layered in ways unique and typically unheard of. Textures ranged from creamy and nutty to savory and sweet, while paired drinks brought bright acidity, citrus, sweetness, or fizz. For starters, the Majaroni Salad gives a zesty twist to two Filipino party staples. As its name suggests, it playfully merges maja blanca and macaroni salad. Maja blanca is a coconut milk-based pudding that’s traditionally served during Pinoy fiestas and holidays, while macaroni salad is typically made with macaroni and mayonnaise, which is another Pinoy favorite. Siman’s version is creamier and more layered, mixing shredded chicken, corn, carrots, raisins, and pineapple. The sweetness of the maja combined with the tang of the fruits gives the salad a dessert-like, nostalgic quality. Siman said that he believes that cream and fruit work really well together, so he paired that dish with a Peach Mango Butterfly Pea, a lemon juice–based drink blended with peach mango spread, butterfly pea extract, and soda water. The bright acidity and fizz cut through the creaminess to refresh the palate. The appetizer featured the Viet Kung Pao Canape with Cranberry Sangria. The canape brought together a bite-sized combination of shrimp, angel hair pasta, carrots, cucumber, lettuce, nuoc cham, and nuts. The dish drew from the flavors of Kung Pao but replaced chicken with shrimp and was presented in Vietnamese-style rice paper. The accompanying drink is a fruity mix of cranberry juice, lemon, apple, and grapes. For those with low tolerance for spice, the sweetness and light acidity of the sangria helped divert the palate from the subtle spicy taste of the shrimp. “It’s a nice pairing! Something fruity and something seafood with a hint of spice,” explained Siman, who also suggested pairing the canape with red wine. The next pairing takes a Korean-inspired turn with the Jajangmyeon Grilled Cheese and Apple Calamansi Ale. Jajangmyeon is a noodle dish known for its black bean sauce, often spotted in K-dramas. Siman shared that his version was inspired by the common Filipino habit of turning our pancit canton into a sandwich filling, commonly with pandesal (bread). He swapped focaccia for the pandesal and stuffed it with spaghetti tossed in black bean paste, smoked bacon, and cabbage, then sealed with melted cheddar and mozzarella. The thick and savory bite came with a black tomato soup that highlighted the jajangmyeon flavor. The refreshing ale beverage brought a light and crisp sweetness from the mix of apple and calamansi that balanced the heavy flavor of the sandwich. “You need something to wash off dishes that are rich and cheesy. That’s why an apple-calamansi drink is the perfect partner,” said the chef. For the main course, the Bagnet Penne Kare-kare is the dish that leaned most into classic Filipino comfort. It reimagined the peanut-based stew into a pasta entrée, with penne coated in a nutty sauce. Crispy bagnet added crunch and salt, while bagoong tied the flavors together. Siman said that such a rich dish should have a palate cleanser to accompany it. He paired it with a Samalamig Cooler, inspired by the street-favorite sago’t gulaman, but made richer with vanilla cream, coconut milk, and a hint of cinnamon. Its slightly sweet and creamy flavor tempered the thickness and heaviness of the pasta dish, mirroring the Filipino dining rhythm of balancing something savory with something lighter and cooler. Dessert came in the form of Bowtie Churros with Hot Cho-Co, but instead of the usual long churros, Siman’s version used bowtie pasta coated with cinnamon sugar. The pasta had a firm, slightly tough bite at first, but softened once dipped into the caramel sauce or the hot chocolate mix from pancake syrup and cocoa powder. Siman believes that sweet treats can also be transformed into drinks. The Hot Cho-Co dip also worked as a comforting beverage, mirroring the familiar churros and hot chocolate duo. It wasn’t too sweet, which worked well with the sugary coating of the pasta. Through his five-course menu, Siman shows there is no limit to pairings. Beyond the typical red meat with wine or seafood with white wine, Filipino flavors and ingredients can meld with other cuisines—as long as creativity, bravery, technique, and respect proudly remain at the table. – Steph Arnaldo and Alessandria Corral/Rappler.com Alessandria Corral is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Speech Communication at the University of the Philippines Diliman.",True,true,The perfect match: Chef Wado Siman on creating unique pasta and drink pairings,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/chef-wado-siman-pasta-drink-pairings/,Rappler
"With e-commerce platforms continuing to offer cheaper goods than many of those sold in bricks and mortar, big Philippine retailers continue to adapt in a bid to attract more consumers to physical stores. And the way they’re doing it is by making retail experiential. Here are some recent cases in the Philippines: In the age of experiential retail, buying a Teddy Bear isn’t the way it used to be. For the longest time, buying a huggable teddy bear was just picking one from store shelves and paying for it. Now, they’ve made buying that plush toy a more emotional experience. In select malls in Metro Manila, create-your-own plush toys brand Hello Bear has set up operations that let people partly create their own huggable plushies. First, you choose a plush toy animal that’s not filled with stuffing material. Second, you attach the plush toy to a machine and by pressing on a foot pedal, the machine blows the fluff into the plush toy. You can fill it up or leave it half-filled, depending on how soft you want it. Third, you can choose to add a battery-operated small red heart into the plush to give it an artificial heart beat. It stops automatically when the toy is not being used. You can also add a small voice recorder that can record any message you want the plush to repeat. A post shared by Hello Bear (@hellobearph) Fourth, you or the attendant stiches the hole. Fifth, you can opt to buy accessories for the plush toy such as clothes, toy head phone, toy camera, sunglasses, or head band. Sixth, give the plushie a name, which will be written on an ID card. The plush toy will cost a minimum of P1,000. The cost increases with more gadgets and accessories. There are Hello Bear outlets at Century City Mall in Makati; Venice Grand Canal in BGC; Newport World Resorts, Pasay City; Toys R Us Power Plant Mall in Makati; and Toys R Us Opus Mall in Quezon City; Promenade, Greenhills in San Juan City.

A lot of spending, a lot of revenue is now directed into fast purchases from that social channel,” Dee said. “TikTok is mostly live selling, pushing, explaining price products and much cheaper. We’re doing a lot of both [physical and digital].” A post shared by Bonifacio High Street (@bonifaciohighstreet) Sunnies has also set up two big outlets — one in SM Mall of Asia and the other in Bonifacio Global City — that combine all their brands – Sunnies eyewear, Sunnies Face makeup, Sunnies Flask, and Sunnies Coffee — so that customers can “seek the full Sunnies experience…,” a place where people can “meet, drink, read, and engage.” ​SM Megamalls president Steven Tan, in a recent interview on the ABS-CBN News Channel, cited the case of the Sunnies World outlet in SM Mall of Asia as a prime example of how enterprises stay relevant in the digital age. “Filipinos, especially the younger ones, GenZs and Gen Alphas, they look for experiences nowadays. It’s no longer, you put out your wares, they come, they buy. You really have to entice them, make it really pleasurable and enjoyable for them,” he said. “In Sunnies World in MOA, you can do personalization, emboss your initials, they even have a café inside, they have a make-up consultant for you. All these things you cannot do online. These are things online cannot replace.” And then, there’s cinema 3.0, supposedly better than IMAX. SM Prime, the biggest cinema operator in the country, hasn’t given up on the cinema business, even though more people continue to shift to streaming platforms for movie-going. Last September, it opened the country’s first SCREENX theater in the Philippines’ largest mall, SM Mall of Asia (MOA). “SCREENX enhances the traditional movie experience by extending the image across the main screen onto the theatre’s right and left walls, creating a fully immersive viewing environment unlike any other,” said SM Cinema in a press release. Below are some videos that show what watching on SCREENX is like. SM partnered with South Korean-based CJ 4DPLEX, a company that has developed film technologies such as 4DX and UltraDX. If you want to experience SCREENX during the long holiday break, you can watch Avatar: Fire and Ash at SM MOA. Tickets cost P700 each. SM Supermalls president Steven Tan said SCREENX could attract the younger generation back to cinemas. “You just have to create a different experience, they want immersive experience. Screen X, the latest technology, [the screen is] is not just in front of you but goes all the way to the sides, like a 360-degree experience…,” Tan said in a recent interview with the Manila Bulletin. “Gone are the days of big cinemas. They’re not after that.” Whether these business innovations will succeed for the long term remain to be seen, especially since they make the retail experience more expensive. But one thing’s for sure: we’re going to see more experiential retail in 2026 and in the years to come. – Rappler.com",True,true,[BizSights] Malling 3.0: How retailers are upgrading your shopping experience,https://www.rappler.com/voices/rappler-blogs/bizsights-how-retailers-upgrading-shopping-experience/,Rappler
"We are what we are now as a country because of Martial Law. So profound and lasting was the Marcos dictatorship (1972–1986) that much of our current underdevelopment in the 21st century can still be attributed to it. This is the main takeaway from a recent journal article that I wrote with Professor Emeritus Emmanuel S. de Dios of the University of the Philippines School of Economics. Titled “Debt, Dictatorship, and Decline: The Enduring Economic Impact of the Philippines’ 1980s Crisis,” the paper recently got published in the journal Review of Development Economics. Our goal was to quantify the lasting impact of the full-blown debt crisis caused by the Marcos dictatorship. If you didn’t know yet, this debt crisis paved the way for a full-blown economic crisis — the worst in the postwar era, even surpassing the more recent COVID-19 crisis. The Marcosian debt crisis was quite distinct from the subsequent economic crisis. The debt crisis came from the fact that Ferdinand E. Marcos was a glutton for external debt: from 1965 (the first year he was ever elected president) all the way up to 1985 (his last full year in office), the Philippines racked up $25.45 billion in external debt. That’s an astonishing amount of money, needless to say. And much of it went to the infrastructure projects of the dictatorship (overdesigned and corrupted, much like the modus in the current flood-control brouhaha) as well as government corporations and equity infusions in cronies’ businesses. Debt accumulation was so unsustainable that we reached a tipping point in 1983. The economic managers then declared a “debt moratorium,” signaling to our creditors we can no longer pay our debts. Much like an insolvent debtor who loses face with their creditor, this event left a black mark on our record. Nobody wanted to touch us with a ten-foot pole, and yet we still had to negotiate a way to repay our massive outstanding debt. [ANALYSIS] Marcos debt: Ano ang katotohanan? In contrast to the debt crisis, the economic crisis in 1984–1985 was largely the result of the painful remedies we had to take to fix the economy. Our only lifeline was the International Monetary Fund, but they wouldn’t give us much-needed dollars unless the Marcos dictatorship fixed some parts of the economy that up to that point had been badly managed. For instance, we had to finally let go of the unsustainably strong peso and let the peso-dollar exchange rate be determined by market forces. This led to a severe depreciation of the peso that led to much more expensive imports and an astonishingly high average inflation rate of 50% in 1984. To combat this, the old Central Bank had to issue so-called “Jobo bills,” named after former governor Jobo Fernandez. These were short-term, high-yield debt instruments with flexible interest rates, that aimed to pull money out of circulation and attract investments here rather than have them flee abroad. But this move ended up raising interest rates across the economy(adjusted for inflation), and this choked off borrowing in the private sector — hence, the economic crisis that resulted from the debt crisis. I have more of the juicy details in my 2023 book, False Nostalgia. This brings us back to the journal paper. How did Noel de Dios and I quantify exactly the long-term impact of the debt crisis? Crucial here is the observation that the debt crisis of the Philippines in the 1980s was unique in this part of Asia. While other countries also faced the spike of interest rates globally in the 1980s, none suffered a full-blown debt crisis. This suggests that the policies of Marcos made all the difference. We used a quantitative technique called “synthetic control method,” which allowed us to ask: What would have happened to the Philippine economy had the crisis never occurred? Think of it as creating a hypothetical Philippines (or more accurately counterfactual Philippines). In pop culture, think of the Marvel multiverse where things would have been different from the main (canonical) storyline. What if Captain America was not Steve Rogers but Peggy Carter? What if the members of the Avengers were killed before they famously assembled? Applied here, what would the Philippines have looked like if it did not suffer a debt crisis in the 1980s? We were able to do this quantitatively by piecing together the characteristics of nearby economies like Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia which did not experience a similar debt crisis back then. Using this technique, we created the economic trajectory of this “synthetic Philippines” (the technical term), and compared that against the trajectory of the actual Philippines, the one that really existed. The crux of the paper is summarized by the graph below. Note that until the early 1980s, there’s practically no difference between synthetic and actual Philippines. But look how drastically their paths diverged since then, and how wide the gap has grown in the subsequent decades. By 2019, the synthetic Philippines had a GDP about 130% higher than the actual one. On average, from 1981 to 2019, the synthetic Philippines’ economy was more than double the size of what we actually had. In short: the crisis didn’t just cause a short recession. It permanently lowered our growth trajectory. We ran a bunch of tests to check if the method would produce false alarms, but they didn’t. The divergence decidedly happened in the 1980s, reinforcing the idea that it was a historic and decisive turning point for our economy. Fast-forward to 2025, why does this empirical result matter? Apart from the fact that we’re living under the rule of yet another Marcos in Malacañang, red flags are starting to reemerge where our debt is concerned. Sure, we’re still far from a debt crisis. But the debt-GDP ratio is inching up rather than down, and the most recent data says it’s at 63.1% (I’d be really worried if it exceeded 70%). And how much of that debt was accumulated because of overdesigned and corrupted public works projects like for flood control and road networks? Luckily, there are no indications that our dollar supplies are going to get depleted or that we’ll have to declare a debt moratorium. In many ways, the economy inherited by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is miles away from the one that was mangled by his father. But still, the journal paper shows that the Philippines today could be a lot richer had it not been for his father’s historic pillaging and mismanagement of our economy. We could be as rich as (or even richer) than Malaysia or Thailand, some of the region’s leaders. Above all, our paper is a stark reminder that we are now paying the price of massive corruption and mismanagement almost half a century ago. Amid the flood control scandal, if we also let massive corruption go unnoticed and unpunished, we’re likewise putting a huge burden on our children and grandchildren for decades to come.

"Amazon said on Tuesday, October 28, it will reduce its global corporate workforce by about 14,000 people, with more cuts expected next year, in a major shakeup driven in part by adoption of artificial intelligence at the tech giant. The online retailer began laying off employees across multiple divisions as part of a plan, first reported on Monday by Reuters, to cut as many as 30,000 employees. The company has not confirmed the broader layoff plan, but in a companywide email indicated further cuts were planned. Amazon is working to compensate for over-hiring during the peak demand of the pandemic and to limit costs as it enters its crucial holiday selling season. The layoffs offer an early look at the possibly broad effects of AI on workforces. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy flagged the potential for such losses in June, saying increased use of AI tools and agents would lead to more corporate job cuts, particularly through automating routine tasks. Amazon had about 1.56 million full-time and part-time employees at the end of last year. Its corporate workforce includes roughly 350,000 employees. Workers told Reuters they learned their jobs were eliminated from letters sent to their personal email addresses early on Tuesday morning. “You are no longer required to perform work on Amazon’s behalf,” reads the email from Beth Galetti, senior vice president of People Experience and Technology, which was sent to impacted employees and seen by Reuters. She said those workers would be given the option to meet with a human resources employee via video call. “Unfortunately, your role is being eliminated and your employment will end after a non-working period.” Amazon will offer most affected workers 90 days to look for a new role internally and said its recruiting teams would prioritize those candidates. Jassy is undertaking an initiative to reduce what he has described as a surfeit of bureaucracy, including by reducing the number of managers. He spun up an anonymous complaint line for identifying inefficiencies that has elicited some 1,500 responses and over 450 process changes. This week’s move represents the deepest job cuts since 27,000 jobs were eliminated in late 2022 and early 2023. Departments affected on Tuesday include devices, advertising, Prime Video, HR, operations, Alexa and Amazon’s cloud computing unit Amazon Web Services (AWS), employees told Reuters. The full scope of departments affected could not be learned and when contacted for clarification, Amazon redirected Reuters to the post on its website. It was not immediately clear over what period the full extent of job cuts will take place, but Galetti said in the note that Amazon would continue hiring in certain areas and reducing headcount in other divisions heading into 2026. Over the past two years, the company has been carrying out piecemeal job cuts across divisions including books, devices and its Wondery podcast business. The layoffs so far have already helped teams move faster, Galetti said. Shares of the Seattle-based company were up 0.8% at midday on Tuesday. The stock has risen about 3.5% this year, making it the worst performer among the “Magnificent 7” group of megacap tech stocks. Galetti’s note reiterated CEO Jassy’s push to reduce management layers and lean more on AI. Corporations are increasingly using the technology to write code for their software and adopting AI agents to automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Galetti said. Amazon is expected to shell out roughly $118 billion in capital expenditures for the year, with much of it going toward building AI and cloud infrastructure. The company will report third-quarter earnings on Thursday. Separately, US Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday called on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to account for what he said were hundreds of thousands of potential lost jobs due to automation. Sanders was referring to a New York Times article published earlier this month that reported Amazon executives believe 500,000 jobs could be cut over time by replacing warehouse workers with robots. Two US senators have also asked Amazon to explain why it is the nation’s largest employer of foreign workers using H-1B visas while also cutting jobs. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Amazon to cut about 14,000 corporate jobs in AI push",https://www.rappler.com/technology/amazon-cuts-corporate-jobs-ai-push-october-28-2025/,Rappler
"Last week, Chinese-Filipino tycoon Lucio Co pulled a surprise by acquiring 100% of Manny Villar’s troubled PrimeWater Infrastructure Corporation, one of the Philippines’ largest water utility firms, covering 1.7 million households. The transaction surprised many since it had been reported weeks earlier that PrimeWater had been in talks with Maynilad parent firm, Metro Pacific Investments Corporation headed by Manny V. Pangilinan. No less than the Maynilad chairman had confirmed the talks, telling reporters in Hong Kong, “I think if it works for us, if it’s commercially feasible for the group, then obviously we will take a look at it more seriously.” (READ: What’s next for Maynilad after its stock market debut?) Lucio and wife Susan are well-known for being the couple behind the “grocery of the masses” — Puregold — which grew from a single store in Mandaluyong City in 1998 to 511 stores, as of December 2024, mostly in Luzon. Puregold Price Club Inc. is now the second largest Philippine retailer in terms of revenues, next to the Sy family’s SM Retail. While Puregold caters to the lower-income classes, the Cos also own the high-end S&R Membership Shopping Warehouse. The Co family bought this in 2006 and has steadily grown the retail chain that caters to the upper-income classes. From only six stores in 2011, there are now 29 S&R stores that sell mostly imported goods, largely from the US. They also own Office Warehouse, a retail chain that focuses on selling office and school items. The Cos’ other high-profile businesses that consumers may know are: These business ventures have largely made Lucio and Susan among the richest Filipinos on the Forbes’ World’s Billionaires list. But there’s one family business that’s not been widely mentioned as being part of Lucio Co’s business empire: his water utility business. Co owns Pamana Water Corporation, a water utility firm with around 15 branches in six provinces: Pangasinan, Tarlac, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Laguna, and Pagadian City in Zamboanga del Sur. Co’s publicly listed conglomerate Cosco Capital Incorporated lists the 71-year-old businessman as a member of the board of directors of Pamana Water. Pamana started in 2017 or eight years ago, promising its customers that it was “committed to be one of the best utility companies in the country by providing and maintaining clean, safe and adqquate water supply.” Mr. Co has chosen to play a visible role in Pamana’s biggest branch, in Dagupan City, Pangasinan. Pamana Water District Dagupan City recently posted a Facebook reel showing its “chairman Lucio Co” visiting the branch and even joining the employees and some customers in a boodle fight. It’s one of the rare public appearances of Co that’s accessible on the web. Pamana Water’s joint venture with Dagupan City dates back to 2020, and the utility firm claims to have expanded its service there from 27,677 concessioners in 2020 to 32,181 in 2025. It has laid out an additional 20,310 meters of pipes and increased its pumping stations from 18 to 24 over the five-year period. Pamana Water Dagupan City says Co’s visit reinforces the “high quality of service being provided to all customers and ensuring continued operational excellence.” Pamana Water’s joint venture with Dagupan City was inked on December 4, 2020, with Co himself present during the signing in his PBCOM Tower, one of the tallest commercial buildings in the Philippines. He has also graced joint venture agreement signings with other water districts, such as the one with Candaba Water District, Pampanga, in 2021 or during the COVID-19 pandemic. The anti-privatization group Water for the People Network (WPN), in a December 18 statement, says Pamana Water has 15 joint venture agreements in the provinces where they operate. It also criticized PrimeWater’s sale to Co’s Crystal Bridges, claiming Pamana Water hasn’t been a good partner for water districts, citing alleged “consumer complaints” in Nueva Ecija and Tarlac. “Pamana is no saint. Like PrimeWater, consumers have criticized Co’s firm for entering previously well-performing water districts, delivering low to no water in Nueva Ecija, and providing dirty or yellowish water in Tarlac, all while imposing rate hikes such as those seen in Pangasinan,” said WPN spokesperson Leo Espelimbergo. Pamana Water, however, has claimed to be the “preferred water provider” in areas in Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, as well as in Pangasinan, Pampanga, and Laguna. Like many Tsinoys, Co and his wife Susan are media-shy, with hardly any press interviews. He was even absent when his friend, then-Bacolod mayor Albee Benitez, conferred on Co the title of “adopted son and honorary mayor of Bacolod City in February 2024. Co’s daughter Camille Clarisse Co-Lao and her husband Michael Stephen Lao represented Co in the ceremony. (READ: Lucio Co’s takeover of PrimeWater ‘injustice’ for Bacolod consumers – watchdogs) “The title of Honorary Mayor serves as a distinguished recognition for individuals who have made exceptional contributions to the city’s economic growth and progress,” the city said, citing Co’s projects, such as the Bredco port facilities, Puregold, and the S&R Membership Shopping. Lucio Co will probably have to be more transparent and accessbile to the public after buying PrimeWater, what with the numerous complaints from consumers and lapses confirmed by regulators. As Rappler’s business columnist Val Villanueva says, when consumers’ trust is lost, the new owner must work hard to rebuild it, starting by being more transparent and open in its dealings.

"In my last article, I mentioned that there were three key factors blamed for the market’s continued weakness which made it as one of the world’s worst performing markets. The first was about the imminent threat on the country’s political stability as precipitated by the corruption scandal in the government’s flood control program and now compounded by the recent divisive playbooks mounted by the political opposition designed to undermine – if not oust – President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. and his administration. This is followed by the government’s weak spending or underspending activity to spur the economy and by the structural issues confronting the market. These factors also basically explain why the market has become a value trap. A value trap is about a stock or market that appears cheap based on traditional metrics but is actually a poor investment. The reason behind this is that because of its underlying fundamental weaknesses, a stock or market’s valuation will continue to fall. As such, buying a stock or into the market solely based on its low-price metrics, without regard to examining why it is cheap, makes investors fall into what is called a value trap. A comparative look at the performances of the other ASEAN markets in the region, namely Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, may also add to our further understanding on why our market is doing this badly. A cursory review on the performance drivers of these markets may show us enough why. Let us then take a look at what these markets have that our market does not. Based on data from the World Bank, IMF, and regional banks, as gathered by Joel de la Peña, chief trader and market strategist of H.E. Bennett Securities Incorporated, the market status of Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines show a massive performance divergence in 2025 while manifesting a competitive picture of economic growth. Vietnam Exchange Vietnam’s growth is reportedly the most robust, supported by its proactive policy reforms. Its gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been leading in the region, with projections reaching as high as 8.3% for the full year of 2025, driven by exports, investment, and strong domestic consumption. Its foreign direct investment (FDI) is its single biggest driver. FDI reached US$21.52 billion in the first half of 2025, a record of +32.6% year-on-year. (In This Economy: Did PH miss being an upper middle-income country by just $26?) In Vietnam, global companies continue to relocate manufacturing and supply chain operations, especially for high-tech companies for its lower costs and stability. Foreign investors are also piling in investments ahead of a potential upgrade to its stock market by FTSE Russell to Emerging Market status, which could unlock significant new passive capital inflows. The total number of companies listed across Vietnam’s three main stock markets is approximately 1,700 divided into 400 large-cap, 330 mid-cap, and 870 to 900 small-cap business firms with about 393 stockbrokerage houses operating to handle transactions. Liquidity in is exceptionally high. Average daily trading value has been fluctuating between US$1.3 billion to $2.1 billion. In August, Vietnam’s stock market was able to register a single-day record of over $3 billion. Indonesia Stock Exchange As supported by strong domestic economic fundamentals and a healthy capital market, Indonesia has a large and diverse list of firms, consisting of over 903 companies and about 558 stockbrokerage houses. Its large and growing consumer base provides a stable anchor for economic growth and corporate earnings, making it less vulnerable to global trade shocks than its peers. GDP growth has been steady, backed by high commodity prices and sustained domestic consumption. Needless to say, Indonesia is a major commodity exporter. Indonesia has also dominated the initial public offering (IPO) activities in the region, bringing fresh, high-growth listings to the market and maintaining investor confidence. Based on early 2025 data from the Indonesia Capital Market, the average daily trading volume for Indonesia’s stock market is around 18 billion shares and the average daily trading value is approximately $700 million. The Stock Exchange of Thailand Thailand’s stock market has been in a long-term downtrend. Its earnings multiple (P/E ratio) has barely increased for a decade, too. Its economic growth has been suffering as well, averaging to only about 1.9%. Thailand’s market has 860 listed companies with 548 stockbrokerage houses. Thailand’s present market struggles are tied to structural economic growth challenges. Also, foreign investors have been net sellers, contributing to the market’s decline. While tourism is recovering, overall growth has been relatively soft compared to its ASEAN rivals, leading to a downgrade of Thai stocks by major global investment banks. (In This Economy: How traveling abroad made me see the real state of the nation) Bursa Malaysia Malaysia’s economy has shown robust growth in the past, driven by the services and manufacturing sectors that make up to 59.2% and 23.4% of the country’s GDP, respectively. This performance was supported by a strong recovery in domestic demand, exports, and investments, alongside a resilient labor market. Malaysia’s economy is likewise more diversified and less exposed to some external vulnerabilities compared to the Philippines. Yet, as of mid-November 2025, Malaysia’s stock market has seen a year-to-date (YTD) loss of approximately 0.91%. As of November, too, there are a total of approximately 1,091 listed companies across three markets on Malaysia’s stock exchange, namely 808 on the primary “Main market,” 236 on the secondary ”Ace market,” and 236 companies on the tertiary “Leap market.” There are at least “12 primary stockbrokerage houses” offering stockbroking services in Malaysia’s main market. Some of these include major local and international banks and investment firms. While future economic growth is expected to be positive, forecasts indicate that this may be moderated by global factors like trade tensions and rising inflation concerns. Philippine Stock Exchange The Philippines has been consistently reported to be among the fastest-growing economies in the region largely driven by robust domestic demand. However, its stock market’s underperformance is the most severe due to the confluence of at least three major issues relative to governance issues, economic slowdown, and structural flaws. Amid these issues, the country’s foreign direct investment (FDI) also dropped sharply. In August 2025, FDI declined by as much as 40.5% — suggesting that foreign capital is fleeing due to instability and political risk. Together with the recent weather disruptions, the country’s 3rd quarter GDP growth slowed down to 4%, its lowest pace in four years. With about 285 listed companies and 122 stockbrokerage houses, the market’s daily trading volume has been fluctuating significantly from about 110 million shares to 291 million shares while daily value turnover has remained low at no more than $110.0 million. Vietnam is the undisputed star performer among the four other ASEAN markets. Its performance is driven by robust economic growth (the best in the region), by strong FDI, and by regulatory reforms aimed at achieving Emerging Market status, which is expected to channel billions of dollars into the market. Additionally, its yield-to-date (YTD) returns are well over +30%. Indonesia has a “solid” stock market. It is fueled by its large market and strong liquidity, as a reward for its structural reforms and equally high economic growth. It has dominated regional IPO activity, bagging the status of being the second-best stock market performer. Thailand is facing headwinds that its economy is in a “moderate decline.” Growth is also moderated due to softer tourism and consumption. Comparatively, while Thailand’s stock market is slightly underperforming, it is better balanced in composition which is why it is better performing than the Philippines. Malaysia presents a more stable, mature economic picture, with steady growth, lower inflation, a robust labor market, and a better-performing stock market. Its economy is more diversified and less exposed to some external vulnerabilities compared to the Philippines. Like the Philippines but having the better edge, it is currently underperforming, penalized for slow structural growth, unbalanced corporate and market concentration. The Malaysian ringgit also demonstrated greater strength against the US dollar in comparison to the Philippine peso during the year. The Philippines clearly lags behind despite of its reported higher real GDP growth rates as one of the fastest-expanding economies in the region, which is largely driven by resilient household spending and a strong services sector, and remittances from overseas workers. Nonetheless, this growth has been accompanied by a weaker currency and volatility in FDI inflows. To catch up, it’s clear that the Philippines has to immediately take drastic measures to address the negative pressures from its structural issues, low market diversity, and weak investment flows due to low investors’ confidence arising from political and governance issues.

"MANILA, Philippines – Omi Wagyu, a name that doesn’t get as much mainstream attention as Kobe or Matsusaka, belongs to the same elite group of Japan’s “Sandai Wagyū” or “Three Great Wagyu.” Considered a premium cut, especially for Japan’s yakiniku grilling experience, A5 Grade Omi Wagyu is the highest possible grade for Wagyu beef in Japan, according to the Japanese Meat Grading Association (JMGA). Omi Wagyu hails from Shiga prefecture and is produced by some of Japan’s oldest and most respected cattle-farming families, many tracing their craft back hundreds of years in the Edo era. Among them is Daikichi Japanese Black Wagyu Farm, known for its slow fattening process and emphasis on animal welfare. These practices directly affect how wagyu develops marbling, texture, and flavor. The farm is in collaboration with homegrown yakiniku chain Hiro Premier, which opened its newest branch in SM Aura, Taguig City. Hiro Premier’s chefs are fully Japanese-trained, led by MasterChef Shogo Izawa, a Tokyo-born, award-winning chef with over 40 years of experience. Having cooked for world championships in England and Taiwan to the GRAMMYs, Izawa’s quiet skill is grounded in discipline and respect for every ingredient. The spirit of “omotenashi” (the Japanese philosophy of hospitality) fires up Hiro Premier’s yakiniku experience — each grill temperature is monitored with precision by the staff. Servers help angle the tongs for you, adjust heat zones, and can even grill each meat slice for you until it reaches your desired sear and doneness. Smoke doesn’t get too in the way of cooking and conversations, either. Yakiniku looks simple — grill beef, eat, repeat — but there are reasons for the precision. The heat level determines whether the fat melts cleanly or pools, the cut thickness affects tenderness, and even the grill placement changes flavor. Each grade actually combines two evaluations: the yield grade, which measures how much usable meat comes from the cow (with A being the highest, followed by B and C), and the quality grade, scored from 1 to 5 based on marbling, meat color and brightness, texture and firmness, and the fat’s color and luster. An A5 rating means the beef has achieved both the top yield and the highest possible quality score, a combination that results in the intricate marbling and tenderness wagyu is famous for. But where the beef is extracted can change a lot. At Hiro Premier, beautifully presented platters of different cuts provide for an exploratory dive into a variety of flavor profiles and textures, but all within Izawa’s range of high-quality standards. Karubi, or short rib, is the juiciest and most well-marbled of the basics, especially the premium Jo Karubi, and it’s best given a quick sear; a familiar, reliable “intro” cut. Chuck roll sits comfortably in the middle with even marbling and a balanced fat-to-lean ratio for a straightforward bite. Misuji (top blade) is considered a prized cut for its fine marbling, tenderness, and slight natural sweetness. Chuck ribs lean richer, with moderate fat and a fuller beef flavor, while Tokyo Karubi is a leaner short rib variant that delivers a robust, beefier taste, ideal for diners who prefer less fat. And then there’s the ribeye — including the sought-after Omi ribeye — soft, buttery, and quick to cook, often the star of any wagyu set. Yakiniku is meant to be slow and intentional, not rushed or focused on quantity. The Japanese typically choose methodical grilling and premium ingredients over unlimited servings, and Hiro Premier embodies this practice: the restaurant’s minimalist and clean interiors feature bonsai trees, wood-and-stone textures, soft and warm pendant lights, and leather couches that surround authentic Japanese grills, providing an elegant space to match a coveted cut of Japanese beef. – Rappler.com",True,true,"What is Omi Wagyu, and why is it ideal for yakiniku?",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/omi-wagyu-yakiniku-hiro-premier-taguig-city/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The wait is over: La Lola’s churros are back. After a long hiatus, La Lola Churreria — a beloved homegrown brand known for its authentic Spanish-style churros — has returned, launching its first comeback store on October 1 at Evia Lifestyle Center along Daang Hari Road in Las Piñas. La Lola first opened in Rockwell, Makati, in 2014 and quickly expanded across Metro Manila, gaining attention for its extra-long churros made with 100% olive oil, and high-quality chocolate and flour. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced its stores to quietly close across the country. According to The Bistro Group, which is now behind La Lola, the pause provided them the opportunity to reassess and reimagine La Lola. “We really listened to the market, to trends, and to our customers. We studied new eating behaviors and took our time in research and development. The goal was simple: bring back the classics people missed, refine them to fit today’s snacking habits, and add innovations that spark curiosity,” they said. Now, with the churros back in the fryer, the brand’s return brings back the familiar flavors that fans missed — but this time, with new twists to discover. Located on Evia’s ground floor, the new La Lola Churreria introduces a sleek, refined, minimalist look — with rounded concrete corners and soft-colored seats — compared to its previous stores, which embodied vibrant patterns and playful designs. The booth’s clean lines and open setup make it especially inviting for every mallgoer who wants to carry around a snack efficiently at hand. For those who’d like to take a break from strolling, the seats are more snug than spacious, so individuals and smaller groups enjoy their stay better. “We knew people’s tastes were shifting, so we asked ourselves: How do we make La Lola even more relevant today, especially for a younger generation?” said The Bistro Group. “That mindset shaped everything about this comeback.” This time around, you have nine dips to choose from: chocolate, mocha, ube, salted egg, matcha, choco peanut butter, salted caramel, Belgian chocolate, and award-winning Auro‘s dark chocolate. Auro is a proudly Philippine chocolate brand that works directly with Filipino farmers. La Lola still features its Freshly-Cooked Churros in Regular (30 centimeters for P75) and Long (40 cm for P95), sugar-dusted and served with your choice of dip. The churros still carry the signature crunch, with the center softer than expected. Dipping them in salted caramel provides a sweet-and-salty combination. Among the drinks, the Creme Brulee Latte (P155 for hot and P165 for iced) is the most memorable. The bold, rich espresso softens into a custard-like creaminess. The caffeinated kick comes with a smooth aftertaste. One of the more interesting additions to the menu is the Churro Dog (P185), a Japanese hotdog twisted in a churro blanket. Unlike the usual hotdog sandwich with its soft bread, this version comes wrapped with crispy churro swirls. Sweet tooths can also match a crisp bite with a spoonful of ice cream. The new Soft-Serve Ice Cream with Churros (P45) serves vanilla ice cream with two churros, in either Salted Caramel Crunch or Chocolate Fudge. Adapting to the latest trends, the new menu leans into what many Filipinos crave with merienda: coffee. Aside from their usual selection of lattes and cappuccinos, La Lola Churreria now offers more flavors: Spanish Latte (P165 for hot and P145 for iced), Vanilla Cinnamon Latte (P145 for hot and P165 for iced), Sea Salt Caramel Latte (P165 for hot and P195 for iced), and Double Dark Mocha (P165 for hot and P195 for iced). For the non-coffee drinkers or those who’d like to try something new, their lineup also includes the Mango Milk Cloud (P195), Calamansi Burst Tea (P145), Passionate Peach Tea (P165), Strawberry Dream Tea (P165), Lychee Berry Tea (P165), and Yakult Iced Tea (P120). Bistronomia Spanish brand ambassador Marta Aranda expressed that the most challenging experience for La Lola Churerria was when its stores had to close during the pandemic, but she emphasized the hope and optimism behind the brand’s return, noting that Evia Lifestyle Center provided a family-oriented community where they can study the market even more and rebuild “step by step.” “This reopening is truly special because it comes with a fresh rebranding. More importantly, we’ve taken the past years as a time of learning and growth. We’ve refined the recipes, focused on even better quality, and elevated the product,” she shared. For now, there are still no official announcements on whether La Lola will branch out to other areas, making the Evia reopening its flagship comeback store. The Bistro Group is the same company behind TGI Fridays, Italianni’s, Denny’s, and Texas Roadhouse, as well as Spanish concepts under Bistronomía such as Las Flores, Rambla, Tomatito, and Rumba. – Jaella Magno/Rappler.com Jaella Magno is a Rappler intern studying AB Literature major in Creative Writing at De La Salle University.",True,true,Calling all churro lovers!

"Water concessionaire Maynilad made a splash in its Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) debut on Friday, November 7, raising P34.3 billion to fund its massive capital expenditure (capex) program. This makes Maynilad’s debut the PSE’s largest since Monde Nissin’s P48.6-billion public offering in 2021. With such a debut, Maynilad president and chief executive officer Ramoncito Fernandez said the proceeds will fund expansion and service improvements. One thing’s for sure, though: Buying the Villars’ controversial water utility company, PrimeWater, is not in the expansion picture for now. Reports from early October said Maynilad was looking to acquire PrimeWater from the Villars. But Fernandez, in a Friday press conference, denied Maynilad is in talks to acquire the Villar water concessionaire. But he did not completely shut the door on acquiring PrimeWater. The Maynilad chief, however, said that an acquisition could happen if it’s “value-adding” for the water concessionaire. He added that PrimeWater may be in talks with its affiliates. “We are not the ones being talked to, but we don’t know. Our other affiliates can be talked to,” he said. In a press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday, November 13, Fernandez said it was Maynilad’s parent firm, Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (MPIC), that was holding talks with PrimeWater. MPIC owns 53% of Maynilad. “We are not in talks with us, we are not in talks with them, they are in talks with our shareholders,” Fernandez said in a news video aired on the One News business show, Money Talks. One News is part of the MVP Group of Companies. Maynilad board chairman Manny V. Pangilinan (MVP), who is also chair/president/CEO of MPIC, said in the press conference, “I think if it works for us, if it’s commercially feasible for the group, then obviously, we will take a look at it more seriously.” In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Friday, November 14, Maynilad said: “We confirm that exploratory discussions regarding PrimeWater are being undertaken at the Metro Pacific Investments Corporation level. As reported, MPIC has entered into a non-disclosure agreement and has begun preliminary due diligence. Maynilad, however, is not a party to these discussions.” One sister firm that everyone has their eyes on is MetroPac Water Investments Corporation (MWIC), which provides bulk water supply and distribution services to Dumaguete, Iloilo, Cagayan de Oro, and industrial water projects in Vietnam. Former senator Cynthia Villar previously said her husband Manny wants to dispose of PrimeWater since it was being used against them in politics, and it wasn’t making them much money anyway. Instead of acquiring more firms, Fernandez said they want to use the IPO proceeds to fund Maynilad’s “massive” P163-billion capex program to improve its services. Fernandez also said Maynilad is in talks to provide water and wastewater services to the two ongoing reclamation projects in Manila Bay. (READ: Exempted from suspension, Pasay reclamation projects get green light from PRA) “As these reclamation projects will require maybe a decade to build a new city, water will be needed already when they start constructing, so that’s one low-hanging fruit,” Fernandez said in an interview with the ABS-CBN News Channel. Another “low-hanging fruit” for the company includes offering wastewater and sanitation services to its existing commercial and industrial customers. Maynilad also hopes to offer its services to localities adjacent to its current service areas, particularly in Bulacan and Cavite. “The adjacent cities beside our borders, our boundaries, are wanting our services. So that’s a possibility for us that we can offer to these LGUs that are wanting improved services,” he explained. Maynilad is the Philippines’ largest water concessionaire, with 1.5 million billed connections covering 11 Metro Manila cities in the West Zone as well as six areas in Cavite. – Rappler.com",True,true,What’s next for Maynilad after its stock market debut?,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/what-happens-next-maynilad-stock-market-debut/,Rappler
"Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer, First of all, thank you for all the advice and insight you share. I’ve been following your column for a while now, and I’ve learned so much from the way you unpack relationships with honesty and compassion. I’m a big fan. I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and ever since then, it’s been a journey trying to understand myself, especially when it comes to love. For most of my adult life, I’ve been in and out of short-term situationships. They never lasted long enough for me to feel secure or truly seen. It’s been about ten years since my last serious relationship, and now that I’ve met someone who feels different, someone kind, patient, and genuinely good. I find myself scared that I’ll ruin it. There are moments when I feel completely connected to him, like I can finally trust someone again. But then, almost suddenly, I started picking him apart in my mind. I focus on his flaws, convince myself I’m too good for him, or that we’re too different to make it work. Deep down, I know these thoughts aren’t always rational. It’s like my hypomanic state, and it feels like my brain is going against me, whispering things that make me want to run before anything even goes wrong. But when my mania passes, when I’m calm and grounded, I see him clearly. He’s very kind. He listens, and he is understanding. He’s not perfect, but he doesn’t pretend to be. And that scares me too, because maybe this time, it’s real. Do you think a relationship like this can work, given my mental health condition? I don’t want to keep sabotaging something that might actually be good for me. I really care about him, and I want to learn how to love in a way that’s steady, not just intense. Sincerely,Camille Dear Camille, This must be a difficult time for you because you are struggling to come to terms with this new diagnosis. On the one hand, there is hope: You now have an explanation for what may have been behavior that you couldn’t understand and a chance to gain greater control of your life through therapy and medication. On the other, there may be confusion because you are still exploring how best to manage your condition and navigate the day to day issues that life throws up. One of those issues is of course how to handle relationships and it is encouraging that you have already identified areas of concern. That you are aware of your contradictory feelings towards your boyfriend (let’s call him Jay), depending on whether you are hypomanic or stable, illustrates that you already have a good understanding of some of the effects your condition can manifest, inter alia on relationships. The next step is to work with a combination of medication and therapy to enable you to minimize, if not eliminate, the mood swings that have previously interfered with your relationships. You will then be able to maintain and improve the foundation you are building which will position you to offer greater stability to bring to relationships in general. You should consider disclosing your diagnosis with Jay. Offering him the opportunity to understand your condition and your efforts to control its impact on your life would be a further step to expanding the trust and connection between the two of you. This will give him greater agency and the information should assist him in making a better informed decision as to whether he is prepared to be there for you long term or not. If he has already shown himself to be kind and understanding without this knowledge, he should react positively and be happy to join you in your journey. If not, you will at least know that he cannot be relied upon and you will be free to pursue alternatives. All the best, JAF Baer Dear Camille: Thank you very much for your letter. Your last sentence: “I want to learn how to love in a way that’s steady, not just intense,” is spot on. “Sana all” (a Filipino Gen Z expression: “Wouldn’t it be great if all of us had a love like this?). “Steady, not just intense” would be a love worth fighting for, wouldn’t it? This would be a love worth taking risks for, and yet providing enough stability to keep you grounded. “Sana all” indeed. The reason this is “sana all” (I wish all, but alas, it isn’t) is because not everyone has the grit to hack – dare I say, even want to hack — a love like that. This is especially true for people with bipolar disorder. This is even MORE true for those who do not know they have bipolar disorder and thus suddenly find that the love of their life has become boring, meh, “no fun at all.” You have two things working in your favor, despite the terrible disability (true, BUT pampalubag loob! (consolation) you can get 20% off when eating in restaurants and buying your meds — and YOUR card wouldn’t be fake! First, you made sure you went where you would get an accurate diagnosis and you are doing the necessary: meds, therapy and, I am sure, lifestyle choices (especially good sleep!) to manage your disorder. Second, you recognize your mind can play tricks on you, convincing you he is not worth your love so you will be less impulsive and not break up with him at the drop of a hat. Third, you might take Mr. Baer’s sage advice and tell your beau you have bipolar disorder. Not only will it be a litmus test to discover how open he is about mental health issues, it might also encourage him to stay the course when things are sometimes difficult. Besides…everyone needs help nowadays with their relationships, and honesty which oftentimes leads to better intimacy is always a good thing. I really admire you, Camille. How I wish I were that humble and accepting of the universe’s grace when I was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was not. Thus, it took me four marriages before I found THE one. This, btw, is a common symptom of bipolar disorder: having multiple marriages BUT with your ability to see advice from the best columnists around (joking only), your clarity in knowing what it is you want, and grit, determination, hard work, and sense of humor, anything is possible. SO…my bipolar classmate, may all your dreams come true. The non-manic ones at least 😊 Mabuhay ka!

"“May hikbi, may nguynguy, may hagulhol. May atungal, nagwo-walling sa dingding, o kaya’y nakalupasay sa sahig.” (There’s sobbing, there’s weeping, there’s loud crying. There’s wailing, walling, or lying on the floor in despair.) Inside a packed cinema during the tail end of Cinemalaya 2025, filmmaker Dwein Baltazar reads an eight-minute excerpt from Pinilakang Tabing, one of the two new novels by Ricky Lee. She leads the pack of directors who’d interpret parts of the new book — as well as Agaw-Tingin, the National Artist’s freshly released archive of decades’ worth of nonfiction work — through only their voices and stage presence. At this book launch, it was the only excerpt that eventually had a visual supplement. The audience was immersed in a supercut of various faces of crying in Filipino films — from Jolina Magdangal in Labs Kita, Okey Ka Lang? (1998) to Gina Alajar in Moral (1982), both of which Lee wore the screenwriter hat for. After all, this arrangement resonates with the world orchestrated in Pinilakang Tabing, as it revolves around the effect of Philippine cinema on the lives of the book’s characters in a span of 40 years. Despite the story’s long stretch of a timeline, Lee admits that this is the quickest he’s written a novel. “I think partly because taga-movies ako (I think it’s partly because I work for the movies),” he tells Rappler. “I used Lino Brocka as a character. Just a brief appearance, but I know him, so it’s easy to incorporate,” he added in Filipino. “There’s Nora Aunor — again, I know Guy. So, in a way, I know these people. Even the fictional characters, the world they inhabit, I know them. In a way, it’s much easier to write than the other novels — I think four or five months of writing, so I could have it ready in time for the Manila International Book Fair last September.” What makes the crying-focused excerpt extra impactful for me, though, is the realization that I should’ve expected this high attention to vulnerability from Lee, who’d call even writing — his passion — a lonely job. I heard this live in 2019. Inside the University of the Philippines Film Institute, I studied screenwriting with a multigenerational group during his three-day masterclass. I was still in my first year as a full-time professional in my publishing job, and felt like I was getting acquainted with writing from square one despite being passionate about it for years. Hearing a living legend verbalize my deep-seated emotions was strangely satisfying. In 2025, Lee stands by his truth: “I think we need that loneliness.” “Hindi ko alam kung nabanggit ko nun — we need both the solitude and the multitude, kung gusto natin maging writer. You need the multitude kasi kailangan nakakabit ka sa mga tao. Kailangan nakikita ko sila, kailangan naaamoy ko sila. So, kailangan akong sa mga tao naka-immerse, nakikinig sa kanila.” (I’m not sure if I mentioned it that time — we need both the solitude and the multitude, if we want to be a writer. You need the multitude because you need to be attached to people. I need to see them, I need to smell them. So, I need to immerse with them and listen to them.) He continues, “But I also need solitude to touch base with myself. Otherwise, everything I write will be awkward. Nothing’s going to flow inward. In a way, it’s sad because you’re set apart from everybody and then you’re writing something very painful, for example, about society, and you think, ‘What do I do?’ It’s like I’m alone when writing. So it really is sad. But it’s not a hopeless thing. I’m a very optimistic person.” This solitude, it seems, is greatly influenced by how he creates his mornings. “The latest I wake up is 5 am. Immediately after waking up, I go to the computer and start writing. So whether or not there’s a deadline, [whatever] reason, whether I’m in the mood or not, I go and write. it’s like I report for work, because that’s my work, I’m a writer. So I write every day at dawn.” Unlike others, Lee doesn’t need a cup of coffee for his early productivity sprint. But he does listen to Cup of Joe, with songs like” Patutunguhan” and “Estranghero.” Interestingly, he’s more of a music fan than he is of movies and literature. Barging into his playlists would reveal his favorites like local Gen Z bands Lola Amour and The Ridleys, to decade-spanning foreign acts like Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones, and Van Morrison. His car music rotation, he shared, would even jump from Broadway tunes to Filipino musicals. The vast music choices perhaps reflect the colorful process. “I’m a very disorganized person. I cannot stay put. I cannot focus easily. I get restless,” he admits. “I usually tackle two, three projects at the same time. I outline everything; a process, so I can control my chaos. There’s a biography for each character, I have notes. I’m very organized because I’m very disorganized.” After all, he sees every material demanding a unique kind of process. When he put together his 2024 novel Kalahating Bahaghari, he interviewed the trans community, plus people who identify as bisexual, genderfluid, and gay, among others. The research and immersion stage also involved sitting in a class in UP, just so he could relive the experience of being a creative writing student, as well as going to a spa. This is what makes Pinilakang Tabing different — a set visit wasn’t necessary to rekindle the feeling of being soaked in shoots. Agaw-Tingin, however, was another ball game. “Medyo madugo kasi ang dami (It was a bit overwhelming),” Lee says about the selection process. Agaw-Tingin is a collection of his published and unpublished nonfiction work, starting from the ’70s, when he was also working as a journalist. Through gestures, Lee shows me the thickness of his repertoire through the years, and how only a little portion of it was included in the book. But there were pieces he didn’t think twice about, like Mga Batang Lansangan: Sa Taft ang Simula, sa Luneta ang Wakas (1986), which has become a required school reading. Rummaging through old work probably felt like meeting past versions of yourself, I say, to which he instantly agrees. Was there any realization out of this? “When I wrote these article before Martial Law, it turned out I was too polemical. I have many articles that feel like I was clenching my fist, like ready to punch. I’m not like that anymore. I write more obliquely now,” he says. It always seems to boil down to the multitudes. This word reappears when I probe his long-running relationship with the novel. His storied career has pushed him to explore various forms of writing, but what motivates him to return to it? Novels allow a different sense of control — unlike in movies or stage plays where the material is bound to change or evolve because of the multiple minds that come to play, or even the participation of actors. “I don’t mind having no control. But in novels, how nice that there’s one medium where I’m in full control?” he says. Lee then adds, “I can listen to other people’s suggestions and comments. I can reason with them. But in the end, I’m the one doing it from beginning to end. It’s all mine” When it comes to present-day readership, the rise of #BookTok is an interesting case study. While it’s created a community of readers both old and new, it’s also been plagued by criticism for promoting consumerism (through hoarding and not actually reading) or “reading” becoming merely an aesthetic or a performance. Lee doesn’t have TikTok. But he’s aware of its power — one day, his team received around 30 to 40 orders of Kalahating Bahaghari, to which they eventually attributed to a TikTok user posting a tearful review of it beforehand. The same thing happened with Para Kay B, his debut novel, achieving 80 orders in a single day. “Yes, there’s a good side and a bad side. But I’d rather acknowledge its good side than it not existing at all. It’s just a matter of regulating it, making it more correct, making it more honest, and ensuring we actually read. Most of the people do. Some of those who review my work, they read the lines, so you’ll see it,” he explains. “I think hayaan munang mag-grow lahat ng tanim tsaka tanggalin yung damo. May maiiwang mga bulaklak at gulay,” he argues. “Pero kung sabihin natin huwag magtanim, maging puristic tayo at malinis ’yung grounds, wala rin mangyayari. So, allow muna all that. Inevitably, may mga konting damo na lalabas diyan. [Parte ’yun ng] paglago ng lahat.” (I think we should let the seeds grow first before pulling the weeds. Flowers and vegetables will remain. But if we say that we shouldn’t plant at all, and we should be puristic and let the grounds be spotless, nothing will happen. So, just allow all that. Inevitably, a few weeds will come out. That’s part of the growth of everything.) It’s not usual for Lee to spot the silver lining of the most unexpected things. “Our life is already creative as it is. So don’t worry about not being creative. The only thing you have to do is be open to yourself and to experiences. Everything in this world invites you to be creative,” he says. “The kids who would ask you questions while they play; that would already make you creative. When there’s gossip, we fill in the gaps too, right?” Novels give Lee the freedom to “go wherever [he wants] to go.” But that doesn’t mean he’s just floating on air. “I realized my nonfiction articles greatly helped in my writing of fiction, because I interviewed a lot of real people and I immersed, like the street kids of Avenida, Recto, and Luneta,” he recounts. He would return to them night after night. Sometimes he’s alone, other times he’d gone with someone from his highly anticipated workshops, which he’s been holding for free since 1982, producing today’s biggest names in the TV and film industry. “Mas kilala ko ang mga tao, kilala ko ang mundo. Na-ground ako. And yet, because na-ground ako sa realidad nung nakita ko, nagkaroon ako ng laya na lumipad maski saang lugar gusto. Na-ground ako and yet naging groundless din. Nagkaroon akong freedom to be groundless. So, ’yung laya na ’yun, hindi ako magiging confident kung hindi nagsimula sa pagiging grounded. ’Yun yung usually sinasabi ko ’pag may nagpapa-dedicate sa ‘Amapola,’ na pwede naman tayong lumipad na nasa ground ang paa.” (I get to understand the people more, the world more. I got grounded. And yet, since I’m grounded to the realities I saw, I had the freedom to fly anywhere I want to go. I got grounded, yet became groundless. So that freedom, I wouldn’t have been confident had I not been grounded. That’s what I usually tell people who ask for dedication for Amapola, that we can fly even with our feet on the ground.) How has Lee’s relationship with writing changed — especially since he was named National Artist for Film and Broadcast Arts in 2022? “I think the responsibility of a writer has gotten bigger now. Me and others — to be in tune, to be aligned with what’s happening in our surroundings, not to be tone deaf. Because I think the urgency of what’s happening around us has tripled,” he says. “In today’s social media age, one of the most important instruments of both sides are words. So, you need to tell stories if you know how to use words. It’s like, if there’s a savior in our midst right now, it can be words. But if there’s a monster in our midst, it can also be words. This is a clash of narratives. So it’s really important now to tell stories; to tell your story.” “Every story, may the ending be sad or grim or cynical, may the ending be unhappy… Every story is a wish for a better world,” he adds. “So, I’m optimistic. Otherwise, why would you write if you feel everyone is doomed? So even if people are doomed in the ending, it’s because you’re wishing for something.” In the case of wishing, I see a glimpse of this as the National Artist signs my copy of Pinilakang Tabing. “May films keep reminding us who and what we are,” he writes on the first page. As he finishes his message with his go-to sign pen, Lee recounts the spelling of my name through our Messenger chat, where I formally invited him for the interview. “Kayo po pala talaga ’yung kausap ko nun? (I was actually speaking directly to you?)” I quip, genuinely expecting it was entirely his team. “Yes.” – Rappler.com",True,true,"Writing is lonely for National Artist Ricky Lee, but why does he keep doing it?",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/literature/ricky-lee-pinilakang-tabing-agaw-tingin-books/,Rappler
"STOCKHOLM, Sweden – Hungarian writer Laszlo Krasznahorkai won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday, October 9, “for his compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art.” “Laszlo Krasznahorkai is a great epic writer in the Central European tradition that extends through Kafka to Thomas Bernhard, and is characterized by absurdism and grotesque excess,” the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize worth 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2 million), said in a statement. “But there are more strings to his bow, and he also looks to the East in adopting a more contemplative, finely calibrated tone.” Speaking to Swedish Radio, Krasznahorkai said he had only planned to write one book, but after reading his debut novel, Satantango, he wanted to improve his writing with another one. “My life is a permanent correction,” he said. The settings of his novels move across central Europe’s remote villages and towns, from Hungary to Germany, before skipping to the Far East, where his travels to China and Japan left deep-seated impressions on Krasznahorkai. The American critic Susan Sontag crowned him contemporary literature’s “master of the apocalypse,” the Academy said, “a judgement she arrived at after having read the author’s second book Melancholy of Resistance.” The second Hungarian to win the prize, after Imre Kertesz in 2002, Krasznahorkai was born in the small town of Gyula in southeast Hungary, near the Romanian border. Satantango, his 1985 breakthrough, is set in a similarly remote rural area and became a literary sensation in Hungary. “The novel portrays, in powerfully suggestive terms, a destitute group of residents on an abandoned collective farm in the Hungarian countryside just before the fall of communism,” the Academy said. Across the region, collective farms had been set up when farming land was confiscated at the start of communist rule, and many had become symbols of mismanagement and poverty by the time it ended in 1989. “Everyone in the novel is waiting for a miracle to happen, a hope that is from the very outset punctured by the book’s introductory (Franz) Kafka motto: ‘In that case, I’ll miss the thing by waiting for it’,” the Academy said. Krasznahorkai has repeatedly referenced The Castle by Kafka as a key influence. “When I am not reading Kafka, I am thinking about Kafka. When I am not thinking about Kafka, I miss thinking about him,” he told the White Review in 2013. A fierce critic of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Krasznahorkai has said his government was a “psychiatric case” because of its stance on the Ukraine war. Orban opposes military aid to Kyiv and says Hungary should stay out of the war. “How can a country be neutral when the Russians invade a neighboring country?” Krasznahorkai said in an interview with the Yale Review in February. Reacting to the news, Orban wrote in a short message on X: “Laszlo Krasznahorkai, Hungary’s Nobel Prize laureate in literature, brings pride to our nation. Congratulations!” Much of Krasznahorkai’s inspiration comes from experiences in central Europe on the cusp of the fall of communism. In 1987, he moved from communist Hungary to West Berlin, where he said he found “a democratic ambience” he had never experienced before. “Ever since, I have never forgotten the taste of freedom,” he said in an interview on the Friderikusz Podcast in 2023. Krasznahorkai’s writing may resonate with readers immersed in news from Russia’s war in Ukraine as well as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, said Jason Whittaker, Professor of Communications at the University of Lincoln. “We seem to have entered the 21st century in a more hostile and bleak environment than we hoped for at the end of the 20th,” Whittaker said. “So, actually…some of the bleak and darkly comic elements of books such as Satantango actually will resonate with many more readers than previously.” Krasznahorkai had a close creative partnership with Hungarian filmmaker Bela Tarr. Several of his works have been adapted into films by Tarr, including Satantango, which runs to more than seven hours, and The Werckmeister Harmonies. “When I read (Satantango), I knew it immediately that I must make a film based on it,” Tarr told Reuters by phone. “I am very happy… it’s hard to say anything right now.” Their collaboration has garnered critical acclaim. In 1993, he received the German Bestenliste Prize for the best literary work of the year for The Melancholy of Resistance. Established in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel, the prizes for achievements in literature, science and peace have been awarded since 1901. Past winners of the literature prize include French poet and essayist Sully Prudhomme, who bagged the first award, American novelist and short story writer William Faulkner in 1949, Britain’s World War Two Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1953.

"Claim: A Facebook post contains links to a list of Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) beneficiaries scheduled for a payout. Why we fact-checked this: The Facebook post containing the claim has 234 shares, 51 comments, and 145 reactions as of writing. It was posted in a public group named “DSWD ALL REGION” with 9,600 members. The post includes a photo listing the various cash programs of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) including 4Ps, unconditional cash transfer (UCT), and modified conditional cash transfer (MCCT). The caption of the photo says, “Tingnan dito ang mga pangalan niyo, lalo na sa mga hindi naka-payout.” (Check your names here, especially those who have not yet received their payout.) It includes links to a supposed list of beneficiaries and payout schedule per region. Facts: In an email to Rappler on June 11, the DSWD clarified that it does not post the details of 4Ps beneficiaries publicly in compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012. According to the department, beneficiaries are informed of their payout schedules at least a week before they receive their cash grants through their city or municipal links, assisted by the parent leaders. “It can also be announced during Family Development Sessions (FDS), or through the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program’s official Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/DSWDPantawidPamilya),” the DSWD added. Payouts are scheduled per region, and regional schedules are released on the official Facebook page of the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) once cash grants are credited to the beneficiaries’ bank accounts. No online link: The social welfare department also debunked the claim in the Facebook post that a list of beneficiaries and their payout schedules exist online. “The beneficiaries cannot check online if they are scheduled for payout. They can only check cash grant deposits in their accounts through the LBP iAccess,” the DSWD said, referring to the online banking service of Land Bank. Official news: 4Ps is the government’s flagship poverty alleviation scheme that provides cash grants to beneficiaries who meet certain conditions. 4Ps members are selected through the National Targeting Household System or the Listahanan, a targeted survey to identify potential beneficiaries of government programs.

"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Justice (DOJ) expedited the filing of a criminal complaint against lawmakers named by former public works engineer Henry Alcantara. Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla said that after Alcantara swore on his affidavit at the DOJ on Tuesday, September 23, the department treated it as a complaint-affidavit with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) as an endorsing agency. Remulla told Rappler in a message that the complaint is for graft and malversation. This means the DOJ can now start the preliminary investigation. This is the first complaint against Senators Jinggoy Estrada, Joel Villanueva, Ako Bicol Representative Zaldy Co, and former Caloocan representative Mitch Cajayon-Uy, whom Alcantara named as receiving kickbacks from DPWH projects.

"MANILA, Philippines – After opening their 88th mall in the President’s hometown last May, the Sy family is set to unveil mall No. 89 to the public in La Union, the Philippines’ surfing capital in the north, on Friday, October 17. And the opening of SM City La Union perhaps best exemplifies why bricks-and-mortar retail are here to stay in the Philippines despite the popularity of online shopping. The three-story mall’s opening weekend in what’s also known as “ELYU” offers physical and community engagements that e-commerce can never match. Lined up are a beach volleyball tournament with 16 participating teams, frisbee play, three nights with DJs, sunset music sessions, and fireworks. All these seek to match the mall’s “vibe” with La Union’s reputation as a surfing capital. A post shared by SM City La Union (@smcitylaunion) These events are set to be held within the mall’s premises, mostly in a recreational space called “Sandbox.” This is a 1,348-square-meter outdoor venue, including a sand volleyball court, for sports tournaments, mini-concerts, yoga, Zumba, and other community activities. “Alongside it runs a bike lane parallel to a man-made sandbar, giving cyclists a unique way to enjoy the area’s open-air setting,” SM Prime said. SM City La Union also has water fountains, a long faćade with vertical fins that mimic waves, plus an art installation by artist-designer Leeroy New, whose works often portray the need for sustainable development. “Using bamboo, upcycled bottles, and construction scraps, he created a spaceship-inspired canopy that reflects light and sound throughout the day, symbolizing transformation and renewal,” said SM Megamalls. The mall’s interior also has “double-height atrium”that connects the Department Store, cinemas, and food hall,“with clerestories and wide glass spans bringing natural light across all three levels,” the country’s largest mall operator and developer said. In a statement on Wednesday, October 15, SM Prime president Jeffrey Lim said: “This is our ninth mall in Northern Luzon and we designed it to serve as a landmark for both residents and tourists. As the surfing capital of the region, La Union deserves a retail center that reflects its vibrant lifestyle and rich culture.” A post shared by SM City La Union (@smcitylaunion) Last year, La Union’s tourism sector recorded over P1 billion in revenues, driven by an increase in spending per visitor, as well as slightly higher average length stay, from 1.33 days to 1.39 days, the Sy conglomerate said. Over 500,000 tourists visited San Fernando City, and the surfing and beach towns of San Juan and Bauang. “With our diverse and unique offerings, we hope to strengthen La Union’s position as both a tourism and economic hub in Northern Luzon,” Lim said. Unlike SM’s early shopping centers with retail outlets that sell shoes, groceries, plus a few restaurants, the Sy family’s newer malls and the newly renovated ones put a premium on experiential retail rather than retail as simply shopping. In a recent interview with the ABS-CBN News Channel, SM Megamalls president Steven Tan said this shift is in response to what a younger demographic wants. “Filipinos, especially the GenZs and the Gen Alphas, they look for experiences nowadays. It’s no longer you put out your wares, they come and they buy. You really have to entice them, to make it really pleasurable and enjoyable for them,” Tan said. Sports activities have become big draws for the Sys’ malls. Their Mall of Asia Arena in SM MOA, Pasay City, for instance, has become a major source of revenues, with major sporting events being held there, including the FIBA World Cup in 2023. They recently renovated the MOA to include a 1,800-seat FIFA-grade football pitch at the rooftop. SM City La Union’s beach volleyball tournament from October 17, Friday, to October 19, Sunday, with 16 participating teams reflects the growing popularity of volleyball in the Philippines. Indoor volleyball is perhaps now the second most-watched sport next to basketball, with the country’s Premier Volleyball League (PVL) drawing large crowds, even dwarfing audiences in Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) games. Tan said around 40 SM malls also now have pickleball courts, a response to another rising sport in the country. “SM is now the biggest active lifestyle hub [in the Philippines],” he said. Last year, SM Megamalls opened the Japanese-inspired SM City J Mall in Mandaue City, Cebu in Central Visayas. It includes a JDistrict that allows visitors to experience some of Japan’s attractions. Tan said this shift means going to a mall is not just to buy essentials but “has become very experiential.” “Malls have become the modern-day plazas of this era,” he said. SM Supermalls saw a record high of 5.2 million average daily foot traffic in 2024, up 6% from the 4.9 million logged in 2023. It had also set aside P21 billion for mall expansions this year.

"Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer, I have a question that has been running through my mind for quite some time, and I hope you can shed some light on it: Does penis size really matter? For context, I used to have a “friends with benefits” setup with a guy who had a 7-inch penis, and I have to admit — the sex was incredible. Aside from the size, he was also attentive, skilled, and very in tune with my needs. We were so sexually compatible that we kept the arrangement going for quite a while, despite not having much else in common. He’s Filipino, by the way, I don’t know why I feel the need to mention it, but somehow it feels relevant. Haha. Eventually, we ended things because he wanted something more serious while I wasn’t ready to commit. To be honest, I also didn’t see myself in a long-term relationship with him, so it felt like the right decision to part ways. Fast forward to now, I’m currently dating someone new, and this time, I am open to committing. We connect on so many levels: we share hobbies, have the same sense of humor, and genuinely enjoy each other’s company. He’s thoughtful, patient, and very understanding. In short, he checks all the boxes of someone I can see myself building a future with. But here’s where my confusion lies: compared to my former partner, his penis is slightly smaller. He’s still a good lover, he tries hard to please me, and I appreciate the effort, but sometimes I feel like it doesn’t quite measure up to the physical intensity I used to experience. And I hate that this thought even crosses my mind, because it makes me feel shallow and guilty. I don’t want to jeopardize a relationship that feels so promising just because of this concern. Yet I can’t help but wonder — am I setting myself up for disappointment in the long run if I keep fixating on this? How much weight should penis size really have when it comes to sexual satisfaction and building a lasting relationship? I truly want this to work, but this issue keeps nagging at me. Please help me sort through this confusion. Sincerely, Veronica Dear Veronica, It seems that you are comparing very different relationships. The first is a friends with benefits, no commitment, focused on mutual pleasure and sexual compatibility, to the exclusion of all else. The second has all the components for a long-term commitment, combining shared interests and sense of humor, etc. The third is an imaginary future relationship which combines the best of the first two. In other words, the comparison is between physical attraction and emotional connection, two realities, and a fantasy. The frequency of sex in a relationship usually diminishes with time. The quality may not, but the quantity certainly does. As a result, a relationship built solely on physical attraction has almost no chance of long-term success. However, when the physical is complemented by trust, respect, love, and attention, then there is cause for hope. A connection of this sort can be nurtured and can grow into a special bond between two people. You have already rejected a sex only relationship because you didn’t have anything else in common. You have now found someone with whom you feel that a commitment stands a chance of success. He is already a good lover so it’s not as though you are physically incompatible, and with time, practice and experimentation, sex together might well get even better. All the best, JAFBaer Dear Veronica, Thank you so much for your letter, one with an honesty so rare it takes my breath away. This is because folklore and culture encourage women to think penis size doesn’t matter. An example of this encouragement is sayings like: “It’s not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog that counts” etc. Even science used to encourage the belief by implying that penis length doesn’t really matter since women feel the penis the most closest to the introitus (the vaginal opening). But that is old science. Some relatively more current science journal articles like this state that nerve endings were regularly identified in all locations with “no site of increased density.” This is in sharp contrast to “old science’s” insistence that approximately 90% of the women’s nerve endings are located in the lower third of a woman’s vagina (thus this is THE most sensitive part of a women’s vaginal canal, further implying that the upper two thirds do not “feel” as much stimulation. My answer, however, as a clinical psychologist rather than a biological scientist is that “there is feeling and there is FEELING.” While a woman’s feeling may have to do with density of nerve endings, a woman’s FEELINGS have to do with much more — including (but not limited to) how she likes her cervix stimulated. Thus, to answer the age-old question: “Does penis size really matter?” it seems to me that this depends on the woman answering the question. That is because each woman has her own expectations, fantasies, and yes, perhaps even concentration and /or distribution of her vaginal nerve endings. The answer can acknowledge both the physical sensations and the emotional ones, as in: “Yes, I felt more physical intensity with my former lover, but my current lover and I share a deeper emotional connection.” Furthermore, the answer can be even more nuanced than that, as in “what worries me is: To what extent will penis size matter in terms of the love I feel for my husband in the long run?” Alas, I cannot give you an equally nuanced answer to your more nuanced question because again, that depends, ultimately, on you. And no, wondering about this does not make you mababaw (superficial), it makes you an honest woman with an unflinching desire to know how the biological factors in with the entire picture. In my clinical experience, women who married men primarily for the physical intensity they felt with him during their sex encounters, all but one felt they had made the wrong choice. One client even said: “I married him because of his PhD and his 8-inch schlong, but men with PhDs are a dime a dozen (in the uni I teach at) but the mind-blowing sex stopped being when his 8 inches stopped mattering 8 months after the wedding.” Will your former lover’s 7 inches stop mattering 7 months after your commitment to your current lover? I have no doubt it will. I daresay it’s already stopped mattering now, given your choice of who you want to commit yourself to. Definitely, you look back on your sexual encounters, acknowledge and perhaps even accept that now the physical intensity of the past was more than the present. You do not have dementia, so of course you remember…but with how much wistfulness (as opposed to mere recollection) depends on so many factors, one of which is, do you share the same sense of humor? As to the one woman who did not regret her decision of marrying her lover with a large penis, that was clearly because the size of his penis matched the size of his mind and his heart.

"When Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) announced its intention to issue a blue bond, it did more than enter a rising frontier of sustainable finance. It opened a new debate: Can private capital genuinely protect the Philippine marine economy — or will “blue” merely rebrand old vulnerabilities in public infrastructure finance? This is no ordinary issue about geography. The Philippines is a nation of coasts — 36,000 kilometers of shorelines, marine biodiversity that rivals the Coral Triangle, and a population clustered along fragile waters. Yet those same waters have long been collateral damage in the country’s most expensive and politically charged public spending category: coastal development, flood control, port expansion, and wastewater systems. Through the years, billions of government funds have been allocated on these crucial concerns — billions that remain unaccounted for. Since public funding is generally used to benefit communities through health programs, environmental care, or infrastructure in high-need communities, one question naturally emerges when a private bank like BPI steps in with capital tied to oceans, wastewater, and coastal resilience: Are blue bonds a visionary tool or an admission that public funds tend to vanish before their job was done? 1. Definition creep / “blue-washing” risk Green, blue, and social bonds are all thematic bonds designed to finance projects that create a specific positive impact, but their focus areas differ. Green bonds are dedicated to environmental projects, and social bonds fund initiatives that promote social well-being. Blue bonds are a specialized category within green bonds, specifically targeting the financing of projects related to ocean and marine conservation. One of the largest risks in any green, blue, or social is the credibility of the Use-of-Proceeds and the risk of “green / blue-washing” (i.e., proceeds used for projects that claim sustainability credentials but in effect are only marginally so). For a blue bond especially, the boundaries can be fuzzy: what counts as “marine and ocean-based sustainability”? Does it include large commercial shipping that merely replaces one fuel with another? Does it include port expansion with increased traffic? Does it include coastal real-estate development labeled as “eco-tourism” but with heavy environmental impact? Without tight eligibility criteria and strong third-party verification, the risk is that the instrument becomes a mere marketing tool rather than a real effort with social impact. Given that BPI’s framework only includes Blue as one category (rather than clearly evidencing many projects ready for deployment) one must ask: will BPI refrain from issuing until there are enough pipeline projects with concrete measurable outcomes, or will market pressure push them to issue first and then find projects later? BPI says it already “has some projects that would be eligible once it have the framework,” but that still leaves the door open for opportunistic use. 2. Project risk / execution risk Marine and ocean-based projects often carry higher execution risk: permitting (coastal zoning, environmental impact assessments), community opposition, logistics (offshore installations cost more than onshore), climate risk (storms, sea-level rise, typhoons), and technology risk (marine renewables are less mature). If BPI finances these projects via the blue bond, then there is higher risk of cost overruns, delays, and non-performance which may either undermine investor confidence or lead to reputational risk for the bank. Also, if the projects generate revenue streams (fishing, tourism, port logistics) they may be subject to regulatory risk, biodiversity impact risk (if not done sensitively), or climate-shock risk, which raises questions for the bank about how it will mitigate such risk, and whether the bond documentation includes risk allocation, reserve funds, monitoring, etc. 3. Funding cost versus use-of-proceeds mismatch In BPI’s previous issuance (the SINAG bonds), the bond was a short tenor (1.5 years) and a relatively high coupon (5.85% per annum) for domestic investors. If a blue bond is issued, the maturity, coupon, currency and investor base will matter greatly. If BPI issues in peso with short maturity, then longer-lived marine projects (which might have pay-back periods of 10-20 years) risk a mismatch: short-term funding for long-term assets. That creates refinancing risk. If investors expect shorter durations, then BPI will have to roll over, potentially at higher cost. If cost of funds is too high, then the bank may either limit the types of projects financed or accept lower internal rates of return — which may challenge economic viability. 4. Accountability and reporting — not a one-off marketing exercise The value of thematic bonds lies not only in raising money but in linking capital to measurable outcomes. If BPI issues a blue bond and then fails to publish credible, audited impact reports (for instance: % of proceeds deployed, types of projects, socio-economic environmental outcomes, verification by independent third party) then the instrument risks being viewed cynically. For those interested in governance, the question they must ask is: will BPI publish disaggregated data on what portion of proceeds go to e.g., sustainable fisheries vs wastewater vs marine renewables? What are the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or jobs created in coastal communities, tons of plastics removed from Gulf of Manila, megawatts (MWs) of marine renewable energy installed? Will there be claw-back or penalty mechanisms if deliverables are not met? The Sustainable Funding Framework mentions reporting, but the devil will be in the details. 5. Potential crowding out / misallocation risk While blue bonds direct funding toward sustainability, there is a governance angle: will they inadvertently crowd out other equally needed investments (e.g., in weaker rural banking, in community credit, in infrastructure in less glamorous sectors)? Also, given the potential “buzz” around blue finance, will some sub-optimal projects be elevated simply to qualify, even though their social or ecological returns are low? In other words: the existence of a labeled bond does not automatically guarantee optimal allocation of capital — there must be a strong governance overlay. Given the Philippines’ history of large-scale infrastructure procurement concerns (which you routinely track), one must watch for transparency regarding project selection, procurement, bidding, supplier oversight, contractor performance. Otherwise, “sustainability theatre” is the risk that arises. 6. Macro / interest-rate / liquidity risk From an investor perspective, blue bonds are still niche, especially in the Philippines. If global interest rates rise, investor appetite may weaken, or yield premiums may widen. For BPI, issuing at the wrong time may mean paying a higher coupon or facing weaker investor demand. There’s also the potential of foreign-currency risk if the bond is issued offshore and repatriated back for domestic projects (unless hedged properly). These broader funding conditions may affect whether the blue bond becomes a cost-effective instrument — something BPI itself acknowledges as it watches market timing. BPI’s sustainable funding framework outlines eligible uses: 1. Waste and wastewater systems near rivers and coasts2. Marine renewable energy (offshore wind, tidal, floating solar) Crucially, traditional flood-control civil works do NOT fall under BPI’s eligibility list. That means no dredging contracts, no dikes, no embankments — the very contracts linked to some of the country’s most persistent procurement controversies. Still, the overlap is unmistakable. Where there are wastewater systems, permits follow. Where ports modernize, government concessions and the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) loom. Where coastal assets rise, local government unit (LGU) approvals and environmental compliance certificates unlock land and water. Although the bond may not touch the flood-control budgets of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), it will stand at the shoreline of government influence. And historically, that shoreline is where public funds have washed out to sea. Fairness demands this: blue bonds can do good. They can move capital faster than the bureaucracy. They can unlock long-term financing for offshore wind and modern sewage systems — both of which government has talked about for decades and still struggles to scale. They can force measurable environmental KPIs, annual reporting, and independent verification — standards government projects only dream of. They can build wastewater treatment where fecal coliform still pollutes Manila Bay. They can support ports that don’t spew untreated bilge into coastal waters. They can finally bring credible financing to fisheries certification — protecting livelihoods instead of merely announcing “livelihood projects.” If executed with rigor, blue finance can leapfrog decades of bureaucratic neglect. And the Philippines — battered by climate change, reliant on ports, dependent on coasts — desperately needs that. For every promising headline, three hard questions follow: 1. IF THE GOVERNMENT ALREADY FUNDED COASTAL PROJECTS, WHY ARE BANKS NEEDED NOW? – Was public money wasted? Delayed? Diverted? Sustainable finance markets do not typically appear in countries where fiscal delivery works flawlessly. They emerge where public capacity is strained or compromised. 2. WHO DECIDES WHICH PROJECTS QUALIFY? – BPI screens internally and hires third-party verifiers. Government does not control the selection — and that is both a blessing and a risk. 3. COULD BLUE LABELS MASK OLD NETWORKS? – The framework bars generic flood-control projects, but wastewater and port environmental upgrades still intersect with traditional contractors and local fiefdoms. Without name-by-name disclosure, even verified funds could flow adjacent to power blocs with a history of shaping coastal budgets. BPI promises: Good — but not enough. The Filipino public deserves project-level visibility, not just aggregated summaries. If taxpayers spent years funding similar priorities, citizens have the right to know where gaps appeared — and who now fills them. A bond marketing like “blue economy” cannot operate behind a blue curtain. We should welcome innovation. We should welcome private capital that aligns profit with stewardship. And we should welcome banks that finance sewage treatment and offshore wind instead of casinos and condos. But we should never welcome with blind trust projects in sectors where billions in public money dissolved without trace. If BPI’s blue bond brings rigor, transparency, and project-by-project accountability, it can become a milestone — a Philippine case study in sustainable finance that protects the sea instead of subsidizing those who polluted it. If not? It risks becoming the next sophisticated vessel through which public failure is laundered into private opportunity — a sustainability label wrapped around old inefficiencies and new invisibility. What matters most now is whether BPI’s blue bonds will purify Philippine waters — or simply learn to swim in them. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] BPI’s blue bonds: Saving our seas or rebranding an old development gap?,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-things-to-know-bank-philippine-islands-blue-bonds/,Rappler
"CEBU, Philippines – Just weeks after a 6.9-magnitude earthquake and Typhoon Tino (Kalmaegi) devastated communities across Cebu province, over 400 business process outsourcing (BPO) workers were notified they would be placed on floating status, a temporary layoff with no pay and no option to seek similar work for up to six months. The notice from Wipro Cebu arrived as many were still repairing damaged homes and dealing with disrupted utilities, compounding the strain of the back-to-back disasters. BPO Industry Employees’ Network (BIEN)-Cebu chairperson Kyle Enero told Rappler that the layoffs have further heightened employees’ anxieties, particularly among long-serving workers. “Lisod sa ilaha jud,” said Enero. “Klaro ang tumong sa paglay-off sa ilaha: pagputol sa length of service nga mapugos og resign ang mga ahente aron mas gamay ilahang mahatag nga bayad ug benepisyo. Sa ingon ani nga pamaagi, gipakita sa kumpanya nga pagpasiguro sa dakong ginansya gihapon ang prayoridad.” (It is really difficult for them. The purpose of the layoff is clear: to cut the length-of-service of employees, forcing agents to resign so the company can provide lower pay and benefits. This way, the company shows that securing large profits remains its top priority.) This adds to ongoing labor and safety concerns in Cebu City’s BPO sector, where employees were reportedly forced to work during the September 30 earthquake despite building damage, with some threatened for opting to evacuate and others sent back to production floors without proper safety checks. Several of the affected Wipro Cebu employees have been with the company for six years or more, and many of them found the layoff notice completely unexpected. Enero told Rappler that for long-serving workers, the announcement “felt like a form of betrayal after years of service.” Workers also questioned Wipro’s claim that the layoffs were due to performance issues since some of the affected employees are among the company’s top performers, making the decision appear arbitrary. “They say it’s really unfair because the reason given for selecting them for the layoff was their performance, even though performance isn’t actually an issue, as some top performers were also included,” said Enero in Cebuano. He recounted the case of a worker who was initially placed on floating status arbitrarily and later subjected to a performance improvement plan for allegedly poor performance, despite already being on floating status at the time. He added that the same employee has now been included in Wipro’s latest round of floating layoffs. “This only exposes that the BPO industry practice of placing agents on floating status, combined with a high attrition rate, puts workers in a precarious situation where their livelihood is directly affected, often forcing them to leave the company — not by choice, but due to circumstances — which essentially amounts to constructive dismissal,” said Enero. He added that during his conversations with workers, their main concern was their benefits and fair compensation, particularly as many are still recovering from the recent typhoon and earthquake. Enero explained that the floating status system is a new form of cost-cutting in the BPO industry, designed to pressure employees to resign so companies can avoid paying benefits that increase with length of service. “While floating status is legal, it does not make it moral or ethical,” he said. Rappler has reached out to Wipro Cebu for comment. This story will be updated once we get a response. In a statement, BIEN-Cebu condemned Wipro’s recent actions, describing the placement of over 400 employees on floating status as an attack on workers’ rights. “While Wipro management has initiated a reprofiling process, they remain deaf to workers’ requests for separation pay and the option to exit the company,” the network said. BIEN-Cebu also urged the Wipro management to grant severance pay to employees placed on floating status, honor requests from workers who wish to be reprofiled to other roles, and show genuine compassion for those still recovering from recent calamities. Enero recently filed a request for dialogue with the Department of Labor and Employment-Regional Office VII (DOLE-VII) to discuss updates on inspections following the September 30 earthquake and address the numerous cases of temporary layoffs in the BPO sector. – Rappler.com Marjuice Destinado is a senior political science student at Cebu Normal University (CNU) and an alumna of the Aries Rufo Journalism Fellowship of Rappler for 2025.",True,true,"After back-to-back disasters, 400 Cebu BPO workers face job uncertainty",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/visayas/cebu-bpo-winpro-workers-job-uncertainty-disasters-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — For years, Manila’s nightlife has revolved around the south — Makati and the Manila Bay area, lighting up with the city’s most spirited nights and sights. But Solaire North in Quezon City shifts the scene northward, highlighting Quezon City’s own brand of sophistication and fun. Framing itself as “Manila’s best kept secret,” the newly-established Quezon Club gilds the first level of Solaire Resort North in its namesake Quezon City, distilling the shared ethos of the resort and its team: not to imitate the energy of the south, but to compose an experience much slower and theatrical, steeped in gold, sound, and history. From Tuesday to Saturday, Quezon Club comes alive with a changing lineup of performances. One night might feature a harpist playing French classics, another a violinist reimagining retro hits under warm amber lights. Each evening offers something different, keeping regulars and newcomers alike curious about what’s next. It takes a moment for guests to realize the melody’s origin. Still, it’s precisely what the club aims for: familiar and nostalgic pop refrains slipping through the language of strings. “It’s not just your standard musicians playing,” general manager Earl Butterhof told Rappler. “Let’s take the violinist, for example. She’s not playing classical music. She’s playing hip hop, commercial songs, and it takes you a while to actually realize, ‘Oh, wait, I know this song,’ but you’ve never heard it played that way before.” Other twilights give way to a lounge singer’s velvet rasp, a DJ’s midnight pulse, or the sculptural daring of a pole performance. Friday and Saturday heighten the spectacle, with their resident dance troupe bursting into choreography set to classic hits from Madonna and Britney Spears. “Is it a dining, immersive experience with entertainment involved?” Butterhof asked. “In most places, it’s generally that you have the dining element, and the entertainment’s a bit more separate. For us, we like to intertwine everything.” Reflecting the club’s flair for entertainment, Quezon Club’s menu brings the same attention to culinary artistry. Behind its kitchen doors, chef January Belardo and director of culinary Hylton Le Roux treat the plate as a stage — modern technique meeting timeless flavor, and a shared appetite for risk. “Many of the dining concepts are Chef Hylton’s babies,” said Butterhof. “I think he was thrilled for the Quezon Club opportunity because then he could kind of do things outside the box, nothing so normal —he could really take some risks and some chances and maybe put some things together that generally, you wouldn’t think of.” Still, the menu grounds itself in Western classics. Among the early crowd favorites are the Paella Valenciana, Beef Wellington, and lamb and duck dishes, all hearty signatures that turn fine dining into a communal affair. The daily specials also keep patrons guessing — dishes that change at the chef’s or the season’s whim. Among the evening’s selections is the Maryland Crab Cake: a starter that teases memories of seaside meals. The crab cake is golden and crisp on the edges, its interior rich with lump crab meat, celery, and onion. A dab of harissa aioli lends heat that blooms slowly, cut clean by the squeeze of a charred lemon. As for mains, the menu turns heartier, moving from shore to pasture. The Roast Halibut is atop a white bean ragout and spinach pesto, curdling into something almost munggo-like in spirit; earthy and clean. The Sous Vide Duck Breast, by contrast, deepens the register: tender slices resting against roasted sweet potato, orange jus, and cowboy beans. The Lamb Rack is seared to precision, its snap pea purée a cool counterpoint to the port wine jus. A true standout of the dessert section is the club’s Hazelnut Lava Cake. It parts open on the knife’s edge, spilling warmth into the cold vanilla scoop atop it and the praline flakes beneath. As dinner winds down, the focus shifts to the bar, which comes alive later in the evening. Here, the allusive signature cocktails section, led by head bartender Martin Protacio, bottles Quezon Club’s flair for reinvention and homage into liquid form. Each drink borrows from the language of Filipino modern art, its colors, textures, and impulses reimagined in glass. Sabel’s Appletini — standard spirits are reworked with calvados, homemade pear vermouth, and apple syrup, then poured from a flask that doubles as a portrait. It is sweet, restrained, and quietly precise. For something more playful, the Breakfast Arabesque lightens the tone: gin, banana syrup, and cereal milk brightened with lemon, a playful blend. Fernando A.’s Rice Highball, meanwhile, offers a familiar pandan syrup and horchata fizz that masks the dark rum. At first, the drink seems like all bark and no bite, with three marshmallows afloat the green drink, but the liquor’s warmth reveals itself after a short pause. The Bird Seller Boulevard completes the quartet, served in an egg-shaped glass cradled within a nested birdcage. Its mix of whisky, tomato vermouth, and salted-egg amaro is all about contrasts and presentation. Ultimately, Quezon Club stands as a reminder that the north’s nightlife need not live in the shadow of the south. “What we’ve been doing since the beginning is not really playing by a rulebook,” Butterhof said. “We want everyone to feel like they can do something here…there’s no bad event, there’s no bad ideas. We feel like this is the venue for everyone.” That spirit of openness, welcome, and play runs through everything within the club’s four opulent walls: the stage performers disciplined in various arts, the menu that changes with evolving appetites, and the bar that turns art into cosmopolitan drinks. Tucked within the city’s restless streets, the club doesn’t try to outshine the south’s nightlife so much as offer an alternative to it — a slower, more deliberate experience that values conversation as much as spectacle. Its prices alone place it among the area’s more extravagant haunts, as the kind of place you’d split the bill for on special nights that call for a little decadence. Quezon Club’s operating hours are Tuesday to Wednesday from 5 pm to 1 am, and Thursday to Saturday from 5 pm to 3 am. Expect to spend in the mid- to high-thousands for mains (entrées begin at P1,200+), with cocktails averaging a few hundred pesos each (~P600). Reservations can be made through their website. – Rappler.com",True,true,A new north star: Quezon Club lights up nightlife scene in Quezon City,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/quezon-club-solaire-north-nightlife-scene/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines has signed a free trade agreement with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), its first with a Middle Eastern country, Malacañang announced Tuesday, January 13. The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between the two countries, Malacañang said in a release, was signed on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) 2026 Summit. Both Marcos and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan witnessed the signing of the agreement. The two also held a brief meeting after the signing ceremony, said the Palace. According to the Palace, the deal “aims to reduce tariffs, enhance market access for goods and services, increase investment flows, and create new opportunities for Filipino professionals and service providers in the UAE.” The UAE hosts around 900,000 Filipinos. The agreement “covers strategic sectors such as digital trade, MSMEs, sustainable development, intellectual property, competition and consumer protection, government procurement, and technical cooperation.” While the Palace has yet to release a briefer on the agreement, it said Philippine “bananas, pineapples, canned tuna, electronics, machinery, and other high-demand products” are seen to benefit from the agreement. Malacañang said that based on initial studies, the CEPA may “boost Philippine exports to the UAE by 9.13%, generate consumer savings, and strengthen overall trade linkages with the Gulf region.” The UAE ranks 18th among Manila’s trade partners and is where around 39% of Philippine exports to the Middle East goes, according to government data. Bilateral trade between the Philippines and the UAE hit over $1.83 billion in 2024. Marcos is in Abu Dhabi for a two-day visit to attend the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week upon the invitation of the UAE president. He is joined by a delegation that includes First Lady Louise Araneta-Marcos, Trade Secretary Cristina Roque, Foreign Affairs Secretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro, Acting Finance Secretary Frederick Go, and Special Envoy to the UAE for Trade and Investment Kathryna Yu-Pimentel. – Rappler.com",True,true,Philippines signs free trade deal with UAE,https://www.rappler.com/business/philippines-uae-free-trade-agreement/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — Tourism is no longer just about enticing travelers to visit the country, but to encourage them to keep coming back for different high-quality experiences. A recent study titled Capturing High-Quality Tourism in Southeast Asia by Oxford Economics (OE), in collaboration with the Asia Pacific International Spirits and Wines Alliance (APISWA) and the Alcoholic Beverages Alliance of the Philippines Inc. (ABAPI), shared key insights on how to maximize tourism opportunities in the region and in the Philippines. Across the board, they all agreed that 2026 is the perfect time to capitalize on travel opportunities, with the tourism sector steadily recovering from the pandemic. In January to August 2024, arrivals to the country reached 65% of pre-pandemic arrivals. But what part of travel should be prioritized? According to the study, it’s the food and beverage (F&B) experiences. The report surveyed 1,800 travelers from the region’s five major tourist source markets — China, South Korea, Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom — to understand traveler destination choices. And from these insights, it was revealed that the availability of quality F&B is valued over historical and cultural sights, especially for higher-income travelers. Tourists are willing to pay more when premium food and beverage experiences are offered. To be precise, that’s around US$250 per person per day. “Premium” does not necessarily equal luxury or gourmet, at least in the context of the study. According to James Lambert, director of economic consulting at Oxford Economics, “premium” in their analysis means high-quality food and beverage products. On one hand, quality could mean serving dishes from award-winning chefs and offering a full range of international, branded alcoholic beverages. But it is also about having a wide variety of options that are easy to access. “That might mean opening early, closing late, [and being] easy to get to,” Lambert said. Apart from the quality of the food, quality of service is also a major factor. “[The premium traveler is] willing to grab a burger from a robot at a casual eatery, but he would not want his 25-year-old scotch to be served by a robot in a Michelin star restaurant,” said a respondent from the study, highlighting the importance of the staff and service of premium F&B. However, while they are willing to pay more for better quality, tourists across different income groups still demand value for their money. Safety and reliability also remain crucial aspects in F&B. The report also notes that premium F&B means different things to different travel groups. Notably, it revealed that tourists from China valued access to F&B, while tourists from Korea and the UK are willing to spend more on exceptional service. How exactly can the industry use this data to drive tourism? According to Lambert, apart from embracing high-quality premium experiences, offering variety is also a key factor in developing F&B experiences. During the panel discussion of the report’s launch, Ramon Alampay, associate professor of the University of the Philippines Institute of Tourism, also emphasized catering to domestic tourists who make up the bulk of tourism in the Philippines. He said that there is a need to provide tourists with more awareness of the local food scene, where to go, and the quality of experience they can expect. An emerging strategy from the industry is promoting this on social media and online sites that travelers seek information from. Meanwhile, Chef Jessie Sinciocio, president and CEO of Chef Jessie Restaurants, shared that the strengths of Filipino F&B are rooted in its novelty. “I believe our food can compete with the best in the world, as long as they are prepared properly,” she said. This comes at a prime time, when the Michelin Guide announced its first-ever selection of Philippine restaurants in its 125-year history. However, one concern is that local producers and suppliers fail to offer consistent quality. For Chef Jessie, the problem lies in the logistics of delivering quality ingredients, a key issue to be addressed in improving local F&B. Ultimately, Alampay believes the data from the report can lead to innovations within the industry that explore new ways of experiencing culture through food. “You also want to have that level of innovation at the regional level. Whether it’s Ilonggo, Kapampangan, Bicol,” he said. Apart from building competitive destinations that offer quality F&B, he emphasized the need for proper training when it comes to offering a Filipino brand of service excellence. — Alyana Fabella/Rappler.com Alyana Fabella is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the Ateneo de Manila University.",True,true,"‘Premium’ food experiences are key to tourism growth, study reveals",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/oxford-economics-study-premium-food-experiences-tourism-growth/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Corned beef sinigang. Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it — the admittedly unique take on the Filipino sour soup helped catapult chef Vicky Pacheco of Sentro 1771 into restaurant stardom, starting the trend of other restaurants following suit. Corned beef sinigang, featuring a homemade tamarind broth base, has all the trimmings of traditional sinigang — kangkong, sitaw, labanos, kamatis, and more — but instead of the usual pork, shrimp, or fish, the star is huge chunks of real corned beef simmered in the sourly comforting broth until soft and fall-off-the-fork tender. Did Pacheco expect her invention to take off and become an iconic staple? “Not at all. I just knew deep down that it was masarap (delicious), and it needed a stage so that many people could enjoy it. A specialty of the house that becomes iconic is a gift from God,” Pacheco told Rappler. It wasn’t the product of brainstorming sessions or extensive R&D. The idea was a spur-of-the-moment, lightbulb idea during Pacheco’s early days at the now-closed Chateau 1771 in El Pueblo, when she passed by a tall pot of broth where corned beef had just been boiled and tenderized. “I tasted the broth and thought to myself, ‘Hmm, ang alat! Lagyan ko kaya ng pangpa-asim? (Hmm, too salty! What if I put something to make it sour?) So I got a small pot and added tamarind. Lasang sinigang! (It tastes like sinigang!)” She then added the boiled corned beef — and just like that, Sinigang na Corned Beef was born. At the time, Corned Beef and Cabbage, a dish of Irish origin, was on the menu of Chateau 1771, which served “No Borders Cuisine.” “After that discovery, I kept on looking for the right opportunity to feature it, but our restaurant concepts at that time were not suited to it,” Pacheco said. So, why not at the modern Filipino restaurant Sentro 1771? It was a risk — we all know how Filipinos can be when a beloved dish is seen to be “butchered” in the name of innovation. But Pacheco knew she couldn’t play it safe. Initial reactions from diners ranged from: “How can corned beef be sinigang? Isn’t it the one in the can? How can that be?” “But it was mysterious. It was unimaginable. That’s why on the menu, I put, ‘You’ve got to try it to believe it!’” she said. Pacheco recalls mountaineer Romeo Garduce, one of the first Filipinos to climb Mount Everest in 2006, visiting Sentro 1771 in Greenbelt 3 to eat Sinigang na Corned Beef right after returning from his climb. “He knew about corned beef sinigang?! It was not even a press event. He went there on his own. I wasn’t even there, but I saw a photo of him in Sentro, and I cannot even remember where I saw it because there was no social media back then,” she shared. That’s when Pacheco realized the power of word of mouth and the impact of a simply delicious dish. Long before food reviews and TikTok vloggers, you knew you’d made it when people purposefully came to your restaurant, solely looking for your food. Shortly after, her Corned Beef Sinigang was well-received. It became viral in its own right, with many diners amazed at how something could taste both familiar yet intriguingly new. How did she strike that balance? “The Filipino taste buds (panglasang Pilipino) must always be honored, whether the dish is an innovation or not, and especially if it is a classic or traditional dish. If there is a fusion of cooking or preparation techniques, of cuisines or of ingredients, the taste of the dish must come home to the Filipino taste buds,” Pacheco said. “Dapat umakma sa panglasa natin (It should be just right for the Filipino taste buds). I don’t mix or use ingredients just because of trends.” At Sentro 1771, Pacheco sticks to her Filipino roots, but also takes pride in other “creations with a twist,” like kesong puti nuggets, crispy suman with mango, and catfish adobo flakes. They may be playful takes on local ingredients, but they remain comforting and familiar — new in form, but homey in flavor. She manages to surprise while staying grounded in her identity as a chef by keeping the specialties and signature dishes untouchable. But for everything else, she studies the “popularity index” while ensuring originality to maintain Sentro’s “Modern Filipino Cuisine” positioning. “What I have learned from good restaurants is to stick to the concept but always look new and polished,” she said. Sentro 1771 does know how to do the classics right — the chicken barbecue is grilled on skewers until moist and juicy, coated in a slightly sweet-savory glaze, while the signature gising-gising is comfortingly creamy with coconut cream and just the right amount of heat. It’s about integrity and finesse, Pacheco shared — from preparation to cooking to plating. “Integrity means being honest (with the ingredients, the weights, the procedures), being authentic (no substitutions that will lower the quality, no shortcuts), and always abiding by the food standards,” Pacheco said. Meanwhile, finesse is doing things with refinement, order, thoughtfulness, and care. She also values hospitality highly. “The customers are called guests, and they should feel at home and special, not ignored after the food has been served. I have been to good-tasting restaurants where I could have walked out after eating without paying the bill, and no one would have noticed.” Pacheco’s culinary lessons stem from years in the industry — but they started at home. She grew up hanging around the kitchen after school, checking what was being served for merienda or prepared for her father’s many gatherings. She ultimately learned how to cook because it became necessary in her job at Chateau 1771 — managing the dining room, but also needing to function as a chef. So she studied with the cooks and asked them to teach her, while buying and reading her favorite cookbooks every night. She mentioned her favorite “cookbook” mentors: Michel Roux, for his precise and refined recipes; Shirley Corriher’s Cookwise, a deep dive into kitchen science; Rose Levy Beranbaum’s The Cake Bible, a baking essential; Harold McGee’s On Food and Cooking, for its technical insights; and Nora Daza’s Cooking With Nora, a well-loved Filipino classic. “In our house, it’s torn, tattered, and stained, but I still use it to this day. The volume and variety of recipes are amazing — and they work!” And over the years, Pacheco realized that cooking was natural and easy for her — “I had the knack for it.” “I wanted to become a real chef after opening Chateau 1771 in 1995. Washing dishes and cooking in the heat appealed to me. I liked the freedom to be creative and the science of cooking. Most of all, the discovery of a new dish always brings joy to me,” she shared. “Not having any cooking experience in any hotel or restaurant and not having a mentor chef molded me to be unique and to rely on my instincts and childhood food memories,” Pacheco shared, noting she edited her own menus, was accountable for the direct costs, and did not do product testing or trial menus. “I became a keen observer. I was too shy to go out in the dining room and ask for feedback.” Instead, she would get her feedback from her harshest yet most trusted critics: her family. “The honest feedback of masarap o hindi masarap (delicious or not) was always the question and the issue. When the food is masarap (delicious), no one says so — you just see the food disappear from the table,” she shared. On her mother’s side of the family, when something is , they would ask for the recipe or discuss the cooking methods and provenance of ingredients. But in her dad’s family, it was not that technical — it was more about cooking from the heart. “It was my lola’s (grandmother) cooking that was masarap. I thought that the phrase ‘cooking from the heart’ was just a saying, but it turned out to be true. Because cooking is laborious, it is so easy to just throw everything together and not care as long as the family is not hungry. I realized why my dad kept saying, ‘Ang luto ng lola mo, ang luto ng lola mo…’ (Your grandmother’s cooking) — that was the standard.” Despite her dad telling her to resign due to Pacheco’s frequent absence during birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries, Pacheco kept on. And years later, after her stint in Chateau 1771, Pacheco decided to try something of her own. She wanted to see Filipino food served with finesse in a beautiful, upscale setting. The execution would be well thought out, and the food presentation would be pleasing to the eye and done with care using nice dinnerware, she said. Sentro 1771 was born — but not easily; she shared that the hardest part was balancing innovation and tradition. “It was not totally traditional nor totally Filipino. It was a fusion of sorts and hard to label because no one really tinkered with Filipino food that much unlike today. In the end, Modern Filipino Cuisine became a genre in the Filipino dining landscape,” she said. Years later, after branch expansions and a growing menu (with corned beef sinigang still at its forefront), Pacheco felt like “Sentro has made its mark” last June, when the Sinigang na Corned Beef was featured in the first I Love Filipino series on Netflix. “It was such an honor as it came from out of the blue. I don’t think Sentro was mentioned but since Sentro and Sinigang na Corned Beef are synonymous, it was the same thing. A restaurant can close down and be forgotten, but a dish can stay on for generations as long as there is a recipe and can therefore be cooked by anyone. Think Nora Daza,” she said. As a female chef in a male-dominated industry, Pacheco shares that she is fortunate to not have had any major gender-centric struggles in her career. “Since I was the chef, no one bullied me. I carried the heavy stuff and did not allow them to help me. Up to now, I stay physically fit by doing weights and cardio so that I can stand with the guys in the kitchen at any given time that I have to.” But if there was anything she would change — any piece of advice to give her younger self — it would be: “You should have gone out to the dining room to meet all those wonderful guests.” This means not getting too caught up in the intricacies of the kitchen or lost in its technicalities — because cooking, at its core, is a love language and an act of service. All the hard work ultimately goes to those who choose to dine in your restaurant, spending their time and money to appreciate your labor of love. That is why now, Pacheco makes it a point to regularly visit her restaurants and reach out personally. And for the future, she would love to see Sentro as a house in an area with a garden with lots of trees and parking. “It can then become a home, not just an outlet inside a mall,” she said. As for Filipino dining, she has high hopes — she sees it continuing to evolve. And through her work and those of other younger chefs, she believes it’s important to show the new generation that it’s not always about price, portion size, or trends. “There is such a thing as authenticity and sensibility, and that Filipino food can be prepared with care and served with sincere hospitality.” And that’s what she plans to continue for Sentro 1771 — and all her ventures to come. – Rappler.com Sentro 1771 has branches in Bonifacio Global City, Greenbelt, and Capitol Commons.",True,true,Who is the female chef behind the famed Corned Beef Sinigang?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/chef-vicky-pacheco-corned-beef-sinigang-sentro-1771-profile/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – In one of the rare infrastructure undertakings of the Sy family, Iloilo City in Western Visayas now has public markets redeveloped by SM Prime Holdings Incorporated, the Philippines’ largest mall developer and operator founded by the late Henry Sy. Built under a public-private partnership (PPP), Iloilo City and SM Prime opened to the public on October 30 the redeveloped Iloilo Central Market, also known as Tienda Mayor, and the Iloilo Terminal Market, the bagsakan or drop-off area for goods traded in Panay Island. The two markets, built decades ago, are located in Iloilo City’s Cultural Tourism Heritage Zone and Historic Center. The redevelopment seeks to preserve and enhance the city’s old commercial business district and help improve the city’s tourism. From drab and unsightly, the new markets have been transformed into bright and clean spaces for the city’s micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). “Before, the old market’s condition was really difficult for us. When it rained, everything got wet, and our regular customers found it inconvenient,” said Jedda Navales, a native coffee vendor. “Now, with the new Iloilo Terminal Market, we’re finally leveling up.” SM Prime spent P3 billion to redevelop the two buildings, which it described as “two of the city’s historic public spaces.“ With additional floors, the Iloilo Central Market now has a gross floor area (GFA) of 17,000 square meters, while the Iloilo Terminal Market has a GFA of 20,000 sqm. The redevelopment projects, solicited for PPP by the local government unit, were undertaken at no cost to the Iloilo City government. SM Prime president Jeffrey Lim said the projects do not signify a new business field for the conglomerate. “This is more to support entrepreneurs which is part of how we do business and as we move to provincial areas so we can create shared growth between us and the MSMEs,” Lim said in a press briefing on Monday, November 10. Lim added that SM Prime currently has no other public market redevelopment projects in its pipeline, but that it is open to working with other local government units (LGUs) to help local entrepreneurs. The PPP was signed in August 2022 between then-Iloilo City mayor Jerry Treñas and SM Prime, and the projects were opened to the public by his successor, daughter Raisa Treñas-Chu, and SM Engineering Design and Development president Hans Sy Jr., a grandson of SM founder Henry Sy. The redevelopment of the Iloilo Central Market, built in the 1920s, expanded the central market section, increasing the space available for vendors (fish and meat, dried fish, flower shops, rice and grains, frozen food) from 529 to 850. This area will be managed by the Iloilo City government. Unlike before, the Iloilo Central Market now has ramps and an elevator for easier access to the two upper floors. In addition, the Iloilo Central Market now has 61 long-term leasable spaces and communal areas which will be handled by SM Prime and from which it hopes to recover its investment. SM Prime said this area includes dining areas where Ilonggo dishes such as batchoy and pancit molo will be available. Iloilo is the Philippines’ first UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy. The Iloilo Terminal Market’s market section, on the other hand, now has spaces for 1,160 vendors from the previous 911. Plus, it now has a lifestyle center in the upper floors with 58 long-term leasable spaces to be handled by SM Prime. SM Supermalls president Steven Tan said the the redeveloped public markets will be fully operational by the end of November. He said the focus in the redevelopment was on hygiene “making sure everything was clean,” including recycling, the sewage treatment plant, and water supply, and improving access. “We have professionalized this and we added more parking to make it more convenient for people who go to the market,” Tan said. “This day marks an important milestone in the history of Iloilo City, a new beginning for our vendors and shoppers. Everything is organized, clean, bright and well-ventilated,” said Treñas-Chu during the soft opening ceremony on October 30. “This project raises the bar and serves as a model of how the private and public sectors can work hand in hand to deliver meaningful, lasting benefits for communities,” the LGU also said in a statement. In a statement on September 22, the Iloilo City Local Economic Enterprise Office (LEEO) clarified that the Iloilo Central Market was “not privatized.” “SM will only manage their designated area, while the rest of the market operations remain under the Local Economic Enterprise Office (LEEO),” it said. It also denied that rent for each of the market space will go up from P900 per month to P5,000 per month. “No such increase has been implemented. In fact, under Executive Order No. 21, the City Government has deferred any adjustment in market rental rates for two years, covering 2025 to 2026,” the LGU office said. SM Prime will manage and maintain the facility under a 25-year lease with the Iloilo City government. – Rappler.com",True,true,"If SM were to redevelop your city’s palengke, what would it look like?",https://www.rappler.com/business/sm-redevelopment-iloilo-central-terminal-market-opens/,Rappler
"The façade has finally cracked. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has confirmed that the very appraisal underpinning Villar Land’s trillion-peso “profit” wasn’t just inflated — it failed to comply with International Valuation Standards, making it a textbook case of misrepresentation. It not only supports Vantage Point’s exposé branding the trillion profit as a mirage; a factual forensic analysis which the Villar camp tried to disparage. E-Value, the appraiser handpicked to justify the ₱1.34-trillion leap in land value, couldn’t even produce the documents that supposedly supported its assumptions and methodology. In other words, the valuation that turned ₱5.2-billion worth of land into “₱1.34 trillion” wasn’t just unbelievable — it was unsupported, undocumented, and unacceptable by global standards. More than a technical oversight, it is a damning red flag that strikes at the core of corporate honesty, investor protection, and the integrity of the Philippine capital markets. When a valuation firm claims compliance with global standards — but the SEC finds no evidence to back it up — it’s misrepresentation. It casts a dark shadow over every executive and director who relied on that number to trumpet Villar Land’s phony near-₱1-trillion profit. The regulator has drawn blood: the trillion-peso fairy tale wasn’t just aggressive accounting — it was built on a valuation report that doesn’t meet the most basic thresholds of transparency and credibility. For a brief, dizzying moment, Villar Land looked like it had broken the laws of financial gravity. On paper, it was suddenly worth over ₱1.3 trillion, after a land revaluation in Villar City turned a ₱5.2-billion acquisition into a ₱1.34-trillion “asset” almost overnight. That sleight of hand helped produce a nearly ₱1-trillion profit for 2024 — what would have been the largest in Philippine corporate history. The market swallowed the story. Villar Land’s shares last traded at ₱2,296 apiece, valuing the company at around ₱1.48 trillion, more than many long-established conglomerates combined. Then the adults entered the room. Audit giant Punongbayan & Araullo (P&A) refused to sign off on the fantasy valuation. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered Villar Land and its appraiser E-Value Philippines to explain how empty or sparsely developed land in Villar City could justify a 25,000% gain. And when the dust settled, Villar Land quietly agreed to slash that valuation by 99%, bringing the supposed ₱1.34-trillion land haul down to a far more earthly figure. What’s left after the trillion-peso mirage evaporated is now visible in the company’s own audited numbers — numbers that the Villar group can no longer spin away. (READ: From P999-B profit, Villar Land’s 2024 net income flat amid dipping sales) And those numbers are ugly. According to Villar Land’s 2024 audited disclosure: That means: Does it look like a triumphant trillion-peso juggernaut? This is what a strained balance sheet looks like: more assets funded by more debt, but providing less cushion for shareholders. If you strip away the hype and just do the math, roughly 62% of Villar Land’s assets are now funded by liabilities, leaving only about 38% backed by equity — yet, this is the same company that recently tried to sell itself as the most valuable listed property play in the country. The most damning part of Villar Land’s 2024 profile is not even the asset write-down. It’s the sudden collapse in liquidity: A year ago, Villar Land had more than three pesos in current assets for every peso of short-term liabilities. Now, it’s down to ₱1.46. Strip out inventory and prepayments, and the cushion almost disappears: the quick ratio is barely above 1.0. In plain language: Short-term obligations have ballooned. The buffer to meet them has almost vanished. Now overlay that with what’s happening outside the balance sheet: A company whose short-term liquidity is visibly eroding cannot afford to be on the wrong side of both its regulators and its investors. And yet, this is what Villar Land’s situation is: tighter cash, heavier scrutiny. On paper, Villar Land can still claim to be profitable: And yet the profitability ratios miraculously improved: How do you get higher margins out of falling revenues and stagnant profits? Look at what’s happening below the operating line: In other words, core business is weakening, but the bottom line is being propped up by non-operating gains — the same part of the financial statements where that now-infamous ₱1.33-trillion fair value “gain” once sat. After you’ve seen one of the most aggressive revaluation attempts in Philippine corporate history, you’d be reckless not to question the quality of every peso that comes from “non-operating” sources. The retained earnings ledger tells an equally troubling story. Do the reconciliation, and you’ll find Villar Land effectively paid out around ₱1.9B in dividends or equity adjustments — more than it earned in 2024 — at a time when: When a company under a valuation scandal is still prioritizing cash distributions over balance-sheet repair, the question practically writes itself: Is the listed firm being used as a cash machine for its controllers while ordinary investors are left holding the suspension risk and regulatory fallout? The valuation gap: 1,000× P/E, 100× P/B, and a shattered narrative. At its last traded price of ₱2,296, Villar Land carried metrics that would be laughable if they weren’t so dangerous: That implies: These are certainly not “premium” valuations. They look more like detached-from-reality valuations, built on the back of a trillion-peso land story that no longer exists in the audited books. Yet as of the last trading day before suspension, the market still priced Villar Land as if that story were true. After a six-month suspension for failing to file audited reports, Villar Land finally returned to the trading floor on November 13, 2025. The market’s reaction should have been a referendum on corporate honesty. Instead, the reopening exposed something far more dangerous: the collapse of price discovery in the Philippine stock market. There are two versions reported by the media Version 1 — The crash The stock plunged 30% on its first day back, falling from ₱2,296 to ₱1,608, Wiping out roughly ₱450 billion in market value. Yet unbelievably — even after a 30% collapse, Villar Land still had a market cap of more than ₱1 trillion. A trillion-peso valuation for a company with ₱1.42B in earnings and ₱21 book value per share. Isn’t it delusion? Version 2 — The “nothing happened” scenario This version paints the opposite picture: that Villar Land didn’t fall at all — it even gained 0.17% to ₱2,300, restoring its pre-suspension market cap of ₱1.5 trillion. A company stripped of its trillion-peso accounting trick somehow came back trading as if nothing had happened. Which is correct? Both — and that’s the problem. Whether it’s ₱1,608 or ₱2,300, both outcomes expose the same hard truth: Villar Land remains valued like a fantasy stock — not a real business. Either the market fell for the hype again, or the stock is so illiquid and insider-dominated that real price discovery is impossible. Either way, it is catastrophic for investor protection. A valuation still over ₱1 trillion — even after the scandal — underscores how fragile and distorted our capital markets have become: …yet still trades at: 1,000× earnings, over 100× book value, higher than Ayala Land and SM Prime combined. If this doesn’t alarm investors, regulators, and policymakers, nothing will. This is not just a problem for Villar Land shareholders. It’s an indictment of a broader ecosystem — from brokers and analysts who cheered the rise, to regulators who moved late, to media players who repeated the trillion-peso headline without interrogating how an “empty or sparsely developed” patch of land could suddenly rival major global properties in value. To be fair, the SEC has now begun to bare its teeth. Look again at the 2024 ratios: Villar Land’s greatest vulnerability today is no longer its leverage or its liquidity — serious as those are. Its greatest vulnerability is trust: This is not just about one billionaire or one property firm. When a listed company can: It sends a chilling message: In the Philippines, paper wealth can still be conjured, traded, and celebrated long before anyone asks if it’s real. If pension funds, banks, and ordinary investors are exposed to that kind of “wealth,” they deserve to know exactly what they’re buying. They deserve a regulator that moves swiftly, an exchange that demands answers, and auditors who are empowered — and protected — when they say “no.” The Villar Land numbers you see now — shrinking revenues, collapsing liquidity, swollen liabilities, and cash payouts that exceed earnings — are not just a financial snapshot. They are evidence of how far the story was allowed to go before anyone hit the brakes. And until the market, the regulators, and the political establishment are willing to confront that uncomfortable truth, the real scandal won’t be the trillion pesos that disappeared. It will be the credibility that goes with it. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] Villar Land’s paper empire unravels,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-analysis-villar-land-earnings-2024/,Rappler
"Once whispered about in clinics or ignored altogether, hormones are finally taking center stage in women’s wellness. From perimenopause to postmenopause, a new generation of doctors, advocates, and everyday women are breaking the silence. They are turning taboo topics into discussions about empowerment, balance, and longevity. For hundreds of years, menopause was treated as a quiet inevitability. Something that women go through, but never talked about out loud. But that narrative is changing. With new science, bioidentical hormone therapies, and holistic approaches redefining care, women are now reclaiming control of their bodies. Some experts are calling this the “second puberty” of adulthood. Menopause, coined in 1821, marks the natural end of a woman’s reproductive years, which the World Health Organization says typically occurs between ages 45 and 55 when the ovaries stop releasing eggs and menstrual periods cease for 12 consecutive months. For some, the transition happens earlier, before age 40, due to genetics, autoimmune conditions, or medical treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, or ovarian surgery. While timing varies and cannot be precisely predicted, menopause is part of a broader biological continuum influenced by a woman’s overall health, lifestyle, and environment. Globally, women are entering this stage healthier and living longer than ever. In 2021, women aged 50 and older made up 26% of all women and girls worldwide, up from 22% a decade earlier, and a woman aged 60 in 2019 could expect to live another 21 years on average. As a result, menopause now represents not an end but a transition, one that affects physical health, emotional wellbeing, and social identity. Experts say it’s a crucial moment to reassess lifestyle and health priorities, paving the way for a new era of proactive, informed, and empowered aging. As conversations around menopause become more open and women continue to seek answers and support, so does the need for dedicated wellness centers and specialists who can guide them through this life stage with care, science, and empathy. “Back in the 1980s and 1990s, hormone therapy had a bad reputation,” said Dr. Candy Drilon-Dalman, a Functional and Integrative Medicine physician who bridges modern science with traditional healing. As co-founder and medical director of Centro Holistico, a wellness center that blends Eastern and Western practices, she focuses on addressing the root causes of chronic disease through personalized care that combines nutrition, lifestyle changes, and acupuncture. “But now, thanks to research and technology, we have bioidentical hormones, plant-based and molecularly identical to what our bodies naturally produce,” Drilon-Dalman said, explaining that unlike synthetic hormones, which can cause side effects and liver strain, bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) integrates seamlessly into the body’s system. “It’s not about reversing time,” she emphasized. “It’s about restoring balance.” Drilon-Dalman was one of the experts who spoke with the women who gathered one Tuesday morning late October at Culture Salon MNL in Global City, Taguig, to talk about hormones, hot flashes, brain fog, and “menopause rage,” among many others. She was joined by Dr. Venisse Valdez, medical consultant at Centro Holistico and CEO of ASL Pharma Philippines, and Claudine Viquiera, ProAge CEO and certified menopause coach. The event was hosted by Michelle Aventajado. Hormones are “messengers,” according to Valdez. “When one signal goes off, like estrogen, progesterone, thyroid, cortisol, the whole system feels it.” Valdez explained that each woman’s hormonal landscape is unique, which is why Centro Holistico uses personalized testing, lifestyle mapping, and holistic therapies to design treatment plans. “You don’t just walk in and get a prescription,” she said. “We talk about your sleep, stress, diet, even your relationships. The goal is to help you live in sync with your hormones.” With as many as 48 recognized symptoms, ranging from insomnia and anxiety to weight gain and loss of libido, Viquiera said it’s not a surprise that women are seeking more holistic, science-backed ways to navigate this chapter. According to her, they’re lifelines for women who simply want to “feel like themselves again.” For many women, perimenopause remains uncharted territory. “When I first started having symptoms, I thought I was too young,” said Viquiera. “But I’ve seen women in their 30s going through the same thing.” Viquiera described how the uncertainty pushed her to research, then advocate. Her ProAge community challenges the notion that women must fight aging. “I was tired of everything being labeled ‘anti-aging.’ Aging is natural, we just need to age well.” She recalled her “aha moment” when she realized she wasn’t “crazy,” just hormonal. “I’d have rage outbursts, anxiety, brain fog, things I couldn’t explain. But once I understood it was perimenopause, everything clicked. I started keeping a journal, tracking sleep, mood, diet, and it changed how I approached my health.” Her advice? “Keep notes. Know your body. Information is power.” The doctors agree that testing is key, but it’s not one-size-fits-all. “We start with baseline hormone tests,” Drilon-Dalman explained. “If you’re on BHRT, we retest after four to five weeks to see how your body responds. For others, every three to six months is enough.” For menstruating women, day 21 of the cycle is the ideal testing window, when both progesterone and estrogen peak. For fertility monitoring, testing on days 5, 14, and 21 helps track hormonal fluctuations. But numbers aren’t everything. “We don’t just look at lab results,” Valdez said. “We ask: are you sleeping better? Do you have more energy? Are your moods stabilizing? Your body’s feedback matters as much as your labs.” That feedback loop, Drilon-Dalman said, becomes the foundation for holistic care, where healing isn’t just medical, but emotional and behavioral. Beyond hormones, the conversation shifted to what Drilon-Dalman calls “low-tox living.” “We’re exposed to so many environmental toxins, from food additives to hair colorants,” she said. “That’s why we partnered with Culture Salon, to offer plant-based beauty options that don’t overload the liver.” Detoxification, she explained, isn’t just about a juice cleanse. It’s about supporting the liver, the body’s main detox organ, so it can process used hormones efficiently. “If your liver’s sluggish, you get estrogen buildup, leading to mood swings, bloating, or heavy periods.” Viquiera echoed this, stressing that “health is a mindfulness practice.” Even self-care rituals matter. “Skincare isn’t just superficial,” she said. “It’s grounding. When you take time to care for your skin, you’re also caring for your mind.” Her brand ProAge, made in Korea, focuses on hydration with seven types of hyaluronic acid, a formulation she insisted on developing for menopausal skin. “We’re the forgotten market,” she said. “Brands cater to 20-somethings, but our needs are different. Self-care is self-respect.” As women rethink menopause, another conversation is quietly unfolding: the hormonal link between mothers and daughters. The experts said today’s girls are entering puberty earlier than ever, raising new questions about how lifestyle and environment shape women’s health across generations. “Yes, puberty is happening earlier,” Drilon-Dalman confirmed. “We’re seeing estrogen dominance in young girls, not because they produce more, but because their bodies can’t detoxify properly.” The culprits: processed foods, dairy, sugar, and lack of sleep. Her advice? “Support their liver early, through natural detoxifiers like chlorella, whole foods, and daily bowel movement. It makes a huge difference.” Valdez added that “detox and stress management” are as important for teens as for menopausal women. “Puberty and menopause are both hormonal transitions. When moms and daughters go through them at the same time, it’s literally a clash of hormones.” For many women, the mention of hormone therapy still raises fears. That’s because early studies in the 1990s linked hormone replacement therapy to cancer, Drilon-Dalman explained. But those trials used synthetic estrogen, not the bioidentical hormones now available. “Bioidentical hormones are derived from natural plant sources like soy or yams,” she said. “They’re molecularly identical to what our bodies make. Synthetic hormones, on the other hand, don’t fit the receptors perfectly, that’s why some women experience liver strain or side effects.” Modern BHRT, she added, can even protect against cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and cognitive decline. “We’re learning that estrogen isn’t just about reproduction — it supports the brain, bones, and skin. Testosterone helps preserve muscle and mood. These hormones are essential for long-term health.” Beyond hormone therapy, Centro Holistico also runs Biovitalis, a longevity clinic offering peptide therapy, stem cell therapy, and exosome therapy, advanced treatments that aim to rejuvenate cells and restore balance. “Some patients in their 40s still want to conceive,” Drilon-Dalman said. “While we can’t stop menopause, we can support fertility through regenerative medicine.” Stem cells, she explained, can be derived from the patient’s own fat tissue or screened donor umbilical cords. “It’s about regeneration, helping your body repair itself.” But she clarified that “these are just tools, not miracles.” The foundation will always be sleep, nutrition, stress management, and hormone balance. Hormonal changes during menopause can leave the skin feeling drier, thinner, or more sensitive, but the right routine can help bring back its natural glow and resilience. Here’s what the ProAge CEO recommends: Swiss brand Instytutum also offers precise and results-driven approach to skincare, with 18 multifunctional products that combine actives like Vitamin C THD, AHA/BHA acids, and advanced retinoids to rejuvenate, hydrate, and protect skin at every stage of life. Founded in 2014 by Dr. Natalia Bobok, MD, PhD, the Swiss beauty firm focuses on extending the skin’s active vitality rather than simply “fighting aging.” Apply products from lightest to richest texture, allowing each layer to absorb fully for optimal results.

"SEOUL, South Korea – South Korea’s parliament has passed a bill to legalize tattoo artists, ending a decades-long ban on tattooing by those without medical licenses. The Tattoist Act passed convincingly on Thursday afternoon with 195 votes in favor out of 202 members present, enabling non-medical professionals to obtain a license. The new law will take effect after a two-year grace period. South Korea is the only developed country where tattooing is considered a procedure that only medical professionals are capable of legally performing. While tattoos are not illegal, tattoo artists face fines of up to 50 million won ($35,464) as well as prison terms for practicing their craft. Despite the ban, Korean tattoos have become increasingly popular at home and abroad, making it easy to spot people on the streets of Korean cities with tattoos including K-pop stars. Tattoo artists welcomed the act’s passage after years fighting to end the ban. “Tattooists in Korea, each working in their own spaces, overcame the isolating nature of our profession and built a solidarity of 1,100 members,” said Doy, a famous South Korean famous tattoo artist and union organizer who has been prosecuted and fined for practicing his profession. “In doing so, we ourselves changed the injustice that had long denied our profession.” President Lee Jae Myung, who has supported legalizing tattoists, is expected to sign it into a law.

"MANILA, Philippines – For the third straight year, it’s in the Philippines’ property sector where Filipino woman leadership in business has been recognized by Forbes Asia, a publication that chronicles entrepreneurial success and economic growth in the region. Mybelle Aragon-Gobio, 52, the first woman to head the Gokongwei family’s property conglomerate, Robinsons Land Corporation (RLC), and Mariana Zobel de Ayala, chair and president of Ayalaland Malls Incorporated, are the two Filipino women on the publication’s 2025 list of “power businesswomen” in Asia. The list, Forbes Asia said, recognizes “20 accomplished leaders who are at the forefront of the region’s fast-evolving business and economic landscape.” Forbes Asia noted that Aragon-Gobio is also the first non-Gokongwei family member to head the firm founded by the late John Gokongwei. She succeeded the patriarch’s only son, Lance Gokongwei, as head of RLC. (READ: Why John Gokongwei donated billions to education) She rose from the ranks and has been with RLC for over 26 years.

"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Amazon is planning to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs beginning on Tuesday, October 28, as the company pares expenses and compensates for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic, according to three people familiar with the matter. The figure represents a small percentage of Amazon’s 1.55 million total employees, but nearly 10% of its roughly 350,000 corporate employees. This would mark Amazon’s largest job cut since late 2022, when it started to eliminate around 27,000 positions. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. Amazon has been trimming smaller numbers of jobs over the past two years across multiple divisions, including devices, communications and podcasting. The cuts beginning this week may affect a variety of divisions, including human resources, known as People Experience and Technology or PXT; operations, devices and services; and Amazon Web Services, the people said. Managers of impacted teams were asked to undergo training on Monday for how to communicate with staff following email notifications that will start going out on Tuesday morning, the people said. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is undertaking an initiative to reduce what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy, including by reducing the number of managers. He installed an anonymous complaint line for identifying inefficiencies that has elicited some 1,500 responses and over 450 process changes, he said earlier this year. Jassy said in June that the increased use of artificial intelligence tools would likely lead to further job cuts, particularly through automating repetitive and routine tasks. “This latest move signals that Amazon is likely realizing enough AI-driven productivity gains within corporate teams to support a substantial reduction in force,” said Sky Canaves, an eMarketer analyst. “Amazon has also been under pressure in the short-term to offset the long-term investments in building out its AI infrastructure.” The full scope of this round of job cuts was not immediately clear. The people familiar with the matter said the number could change over time as Amazon’s financial priorities shift. Fortune earlier reported that the human resources division could be targeted with a cut of roughly 15%. A program begun early this year to bring employees back in the office five days per week, among tech’s most stringent, has failed to generate sufficient attrition, said two of the people, citing that as another reason for the size of the layoff. Some of the employees who are not swiping in daily because they live far from corporate offices, or for other reasons, are being told they have voluntarily quit Amazon and must leave without severance, a savings for the company. Layoffs.fyi, a website tracking tech job cuts, estimated that about 98,000 jobs have been lost so far this year among 216 companies. For all of 2024, the figure was 153,000. Amazon’s largest profit center, cloud computing unit AWS, reported second-quarter sales of $30.9 billion, a 17.5% increase that was well below gains of 39% for Microsoft’s Azure and of 32% for Alphabet’s Google Cloud. Estimates indicate that AWS will have boosted third-quarter sales by about 18% to $32 billion, a slight slowdown from last year’s 19% increase. AWS is still reeling from a roughly 15-hour internet outage last week that felled many of the most popular online services, like Snapchat SNAP.N and Venmo. Amazon appears to be expecting another big holiday selling season. It plans to offer 250,000 seasonal jobs to help staff warehouses, among other needs, the same as in the prior two years. Amazon on Friday also announced a reorganization of a segment of its PXT unit focused on diversity initiatives, a memo reviewed by Reuters showed. The changes largely involved promoting people to new roles. Amazon shares rose 1.2% to $226.97 on Monday. The company plans to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Amazon targets as many as 30,000 corporate job cuts, sources say",https://www.rappler.com/technology/amazon-corporate-job-cuts-october-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Even at a young age, kids are already learning how to communicate with others and recognize emotions — from their own facial expressions to those of the people they’re talking to, whether fellow children or adults. As they grow and engage with their environment, it helps to start early conversations about emotions and mental health. Sometimes, it can be as simple as introducing them to animated films and storybooks that talk about feelings and emotions. Through stories told from a child’s perspective, they can see that it’s okay to feel excited, sad, anxious, or angry. This list of books, films, and series teaches the youth that it’s totally normal to feel different emotions, and that acknowledging these feelings is a step toward better mental health and empathy for others. Adarna House’s Emotions Picture Book series brings a Filipino touch to emotional learning. Each title helps readers name and identify emotions like hiya (shyness), inip (boredom), sabik (excitement), kilig, gigil (cute aggression), sungit (grumpy), and pikon (short-tempered). These books easily capture a kid’s attention since, even before opening the pages, emotions are already illustrated on their expressive covers. Written and illustrated by local talents such as Beth Parrocha (Sabik), Jamie Bauza (Gigil), and Pergy Acuña (Kilig), each story allows children to explore not just the feeling itself but also how to respond to it. Through this collection, simply knowing what an emotion looks like is one easy way to understand it. Written by Jocelyn Francisco and illustrated by Clarissa Tong, Damdaman: Feelings in Filipino is a creative way to connect emotions with nature. The title combines the Filipino terms damdam (feelings) and halaman (plants), creating a garden of emotions — from sadness and happiness to hunger and sleepiness. Inspired by the makahiya, a plant that gets shy when touched, this book sends a message to children that they are free to react whenever they feel overwhelmed. Damdaman also serves as a reminder that even nature feels, just like we humans do. A bilingual children’s book written in Filipino and English, Ang Mga Alon sa Amin offers comfort to youth who have experienced fear or loss. Written by Rainey Dolarte, it tells a story of courage, healing, and growth through Mario, a Tagbanua boy from Palawan whose community was heavily affected by Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in 2013. Apart from its storyline, the book also features expressive art activities that allow parents to encourage their kids to talk about their emotions and learn healthy ways to cope with stress. Written by Palanca hall of famer Eugene Evasco, the classic storybook Federico features the story of a child with Down syndrome, seen through the eyes of his friend Buboy. Its touching narrative serves as a reminder to young readers that mental health and emotional understanding begin with empathy. Through Federico’s story, it can be understood that every child feels, thinks, and expresses themselves differently — and that strength can come from sensitivity and kindness. Pixar’s Inside Out film remains a valuable film for teaching kids about emotions. Through the story of an 11-year-old girl named Riley, emotions named Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are introduced. The film guides young viewers to understand the purpose of every emotion. Nearly a decade later, its sequel Inside Out 2 introduced new characters: Anxiety, Ennui, Embarrassment, and Envy, along with Nostalgia’s brief cameos. These new feelings perfectly capture the adolescent phase of Riley, full of mixed and unfamiliar emotions for young people. Disney’s Encanto film tells the story of the magical Familia Madrigal, where every family member is gifted but not without hidden personal struggles. Apart from its songs and colorful animation, Encanto‘s story makes it a must-watch as it explores generational trauma, people-pleasing, and the journey toward healing unspoken pain. For many children (and even adults), the film serves as a reminder that even the strongest families must learn to talk about their feelings, especially about what hurts them. Turning Red follows the story of a 13-year-old who turns into a giant red panda whenever she experiences overflowing emotions. While Turning Red is light, heartwarming, and fun, the film captures the chaos of puberty, self-discovery, and the challenges of managing relationships. It also shows that change — even the messy kind — is a natural part of growing up. The Emmy Kids Award-winning animated series Bluey has become a favorite among young fans not just because of its fun and adorable dog characters, Bluey and Bingo, but also for its genuine portrayal of childhood and parenthood. With three successful seasons, each episode of Bluey addresses emotions such as anxiety or disappointment through relatable everyday situations. Netflix’s Hilda is a melancholic series that deals with emotional maturity. As Hilda navigates her whimsical world, viewers are introduced to themes of loneliness, curiosity, and courage. This series unpacks the natural capacity of its young audiences to feel deeply and think critically about their emotions. From the educational cartoon channel Lingokids, Baby Bots Backyard Tales turns short episodes into life lessons. Each video helps children explore common feelings like loneliness, nervousness, and anger — even teaching them how to say “no.” In just a few minutes per episode, young audiences learn emotional lessons in a fun and engaging way. – Rappler.com Alessandria Corral is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Speech Communication at University of the Philippines Diliman.",True,true,"LIST: Books, films, series that teach children about emotions and mental health",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/books-films-series-teach-children-emotions-mental-health/,Rappler
"Those who meet him for the first time may find Ron Magsakay as someone full of surprises. Others may be confused by his constant sunny demeanor. Those who realize what Ron has been through get puzzled. This jumble of reactions is understandable. Ron’s trademark is his humor. He is fond of telling comical anecdotes with himself as butt of his own jokes. When he debuted recently as a public speaker, Ron warmed up his audience with his signature self-deprecating approach. Minutes into his maiden facilitation of the session on “care for one’s well-being,” he dropped, so to speak, “the punchline.” He presented in his slideshow a photo of the Magsakay family snapped most likely at Mines View Park in Baguio City. In the picture was a teenaged Ron — then called Ron-ron — his father, mother, and younger sister and brother. Then he told those present that, months later, on April 28, 1986, everyone in that photo, except for Ron, died in a car accident. Editor’s Note: We earlier reported that Ron Magsakay was 12 when he lost his family. This has been corrected. All of a sudden, Ron Magsakay’s family was wiped out. He became an orphan and lost all his siblings at 16 years old. The tragedy happened on a highway in Pozorrubio town, Pangasinan, as the Magsakay family was again on a trip to Baguio. Aside from Ron, a cousin who joined the family, survived the accident. “I lost my family, entirely and immediately,” he said. It was in 2022 when Ron first went upfront with “the punchline” of his life when he self-published his autobiography I Got Humor. COVID was still raging when he launched in a hybrid event the book, or what he now calls the “written” I Got Humor. The book is a collection of his journal entries, recalling and reflecting the peaks and valleys of his life. It unravels his resilience in probably the most difficult of adversities. He took to journaling after it was recommended as part of the healing process of his mental health challenges. Ever since that unspeakable tragedy, Ron has gone through and has overcome a bevy of psychological issues. Along the way, though, he has still managed to succeed as an entrepreneur, and raise a family of his own. His latest malady surfaced in 2020 and was assessed as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The site mayoclinic.org defines PTSD as “a mental health condition that’s caused by an extremely stressful or terrifying event — either being part of it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety and uncontrollable thoughts about the event.” Magsakay said: “PTSD took a heavy toll on me because I could not sleep. If I do not take medication I have difficulty sleeping. The mental effect of PTSD of 2020 was worse than what I went through in 1986 (after the accident). In 1986, someone told me I survived because I had a mission.” He recalled that the PTSD first manifested during a panic attack he experienced on the day of his 51st birthday while driving at the North Luzon Expressway. The panic attack was just the beginning and it took a turn for the worse in the succeeding days. It developed into what professionals told him was “catastrophic anxiety.” Throughout his journey, Ron acknowledged what helped him prevail over his tribulations was the steady stream of emotional support. It was also crucial that he acknowledged he had problems, needed help, and heeded their advice. Ron has emerged as a “mental health advocate.” From the perspective of an outsider, Ron does seem fit to this role, after all he made it through going to hell and back. Last July, he facilitated a session on “Happy Teams, Happy Results: Taking Care of Employees’ Well-being.” He likens this development to a “spoken” edition of I Got Humor. People will attend his talk sessions for the same reason they will pick up and read his book. You are reeled in by the “humor” in a package which promises to give advice on building “happy teams” and getting “healthy results.” From someone with the surname Magsakay, which in Filipino translates to a ride or a trip, Ron delivers in his mentoring sessions bits of advice he himself has collected along his journey. It’s surprising that for what Ron has been through and still witnessing what is no doubt a dark life episode, his book and his workshop will uplift you. He is a humorist, and he admits that he watches videos of stand-up comics to pick up a thing or two from them. But he wields an advantage over most speakers on the topic of mental health — he actually is in the trenches of the toughest of times. In a way, Ron’s ongoing journey is what the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche described in his autobiography Ecce Homo.

"MANILA, Philippines – Unemployment eased in August as jobs affected by severe weather in July made a comeback, the Philippine Statistics Authority reported on Wednesday, October 8. The country’s unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in August from a three-year high of 5.3% in July. The latest unemployment figure translates to 2.03 million jobless Filipinos. Meanwhile, the number of underemployed individuals or those seeking additional jobs or working hours decreased to 5.38 million Filipinos, equivalent to a rate of 10.7%. This is significantly lower than the 14.8% recorded in July, which translated to 6.8 million underemployed Filipinos, and the 11.2% or 5.48 million logged in August 2024. National Statistician Dennis Mapa attributed the improvement to the revival of weather-sensitive jobs that were previously lost due to tropical cyclones that hit the country. “The job losses in July, particularly in agriculture, retail trade, and construction, have now returned. The job losses in July were temporary,” Mapa said in Filipino. Construction followed by fishing and aquaculture were the major industries with the highest annual increases in employment. Construction saw a major rebound as it added 540,000 jobs in August, a reversal from losing 147,000 jobs in July. The fishing and aquaculture sector, which lost 173,000 jobs in July, recorded the second highest annual increase in August with 448,000 new jobs. Meanwhile, wholesale and retail trade still had the highest annual drop for August, as it lost 788,000 jobs. Despite improved weather conditions in August, Mapa said some sectors are still recovering from the aftermath of the July tropical cyclones. He added that certain groups of workers find it difficult to go back to their regular jobs, especially those directly impacted by weather disturbances. “In a way, we need to weather-proof these weather-sensitive groups since they may permanently or temporarily leave these sectors during [the rainy] season,” said Mapa. He also noted that tropical cyclones in September and the recent Cebu earthquake may affect the unemployment rates for September and October. “These are some of the threats brought about by the September weather conditions, which are similar to those in July. These are the risks that can affect certain subsectors, particularly agriculture, retail trade, and construction,” Mapa said in Filipino. Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma welcomed the August jobs data, describing the labor market’s performance as “impressive.” He also vowed to continue scaling up employment and internship programs for the youth. “DOLE will remain steadfast in its commitment to efficient, honest, and transparent public service in the implementation of our programs, projects, and activities,” Laguesma wrote in a statement. The Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev), for its part, said that the latest labor market data shows the government’s commitment to sustained economic growth that can be felt by Filipinos. “As industries evolve, we must ensure that our workers are equipped with the competencies required in new and emerging sectors — so that no Filipino is left behind in our country’s development journey,” said DEPDev Secretary Arsenio Balisacan. – Arriane dela Cruz, with reports from Tatiana Maligro/Rappler.com Arriane dela Cruz is a Rappler intern.

"MANILA, Philippines — Nearly four years after IKEA opened in Pasay City the world’s biggest IKEA branch, the Swedish home furnishing brand cemented its presence in the northern part of Metro Manila, with a new concept shop now open in TriNoma Mall, Quezon City. IKEA and Ayala Malls collaborated to bring the first-ever “Plan and Order Shop” to the country, just six months after the two teams’ first meeting. More than a place to shop for homeware and furniture, the smaller Quezon City branch also has a new planning studio. This allows customers to consult with planning specialists on how to arrange their homes with the right furniture and home decor pieces, even if it’s a tight-knit space. Customization is at the center of this new home improvement experience. “[The Plan and Order Shop] is a quite brand new concept for IKEA in our retail operation. It’s a way to bring our range closer to the many Filipinos,” said IKEA Philippines country retail manager Ricardo Pinheiro at the branch opening on October 23, Thursday. Apart from accessibility to different sectors with its free planning service, Swedish Ambassador-Designate Anna Ferry also emphasized the store’s display of the core values that IKEA and Sweden stand for. “Most importantly, [IKEA promotes a] business sector [that] is ethically sustainable, oriented with people and the planet in mind,” she said. Ferry highlighted the trust and belief IKEA has in the Philippines, as seen in its willingness to invest and expand stores in the country through the opening of the Plan and Order Shop. Also present at the branch opening, Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte pointed out the opportunities for the new IKEA branch with its strategic location in the northern part of the capital region. “[Quezon City is] the largest city in the Philippines with a population of 3.2 million. As said earlier, all of [IKEA’s] customers, or many of [IKEA’s] customers in Pasay are actually from [here],” she said. She added the advantage of the branch’s location at the center of other big local government units. With the city recently being recognized as the Hall of Fame Awardee for being one of the most business-friendly LGUs in the country, the IKEA branch is further proof of the LGU’s move towards growth in the business sector. Belmonte also acknowledged the Ayala Corporation, which she says has been a “close partner of the local government of Quezon City” and has ensured continuous progress in Quezon City. Mariana Zobel de Ayala, currently head of the Leasing and Hospitality Group of Ayala, shared that TriNoma was a mall intentionally built for the city and its people. “We really wanted to serve the dynamic and incredible, and large community that’s here in Quezon City,” she said. With the Plan and Order shop’s location, its services have become within reach of Quezon City’s diverse population living in condos, townhouses, and smaller houses. Zobel de Ayala emphasized that the partnership with IKEA is more than just a business expansion. Beyond offering accessibility to Quezon City and northern residents, she said that the Plan and Order Shop format aligns with IKEA’s vision of inclusive and customer-centric spaces that “elevate everyday life.” “Over the past year, we’ve been looking to move with purpose. [We] reimagine our goals beyond just commercial centers, but really, as the vibrant and future-ready destinations that will continue to inspire, to push, and to engage all of the communities that we serve.” Housing IKEA’s second branch is only one of the steps the Ayala Group is taking towards transforming TriNoma into a space that addresses the lifestyle and needs of its community. – Alyana Fabella/Rappler.com Alyana Fabella is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the Ateneo de Manila University.",True,true,What IKEA’s new TriNoma branch means for QC’s bustling business scene,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/style/ikea-philippines-plan-order-shop-trinoma-quezon-city/,Rappler
"LAOAG CITY, Ilocos Norte – Traditional handloom weaving in the Philippines is in decline due to the rise of modern garment technology. However, weavers from Luzon to Mindanao continue to fight for the survival and continued recognition of their cultural heritage. Based on estimated data, there are over 5,200 weavers from 481 weaving communities in the country. The survival of traditional handloom weaving, passed down through generations, depends on these communities and the people who continue to patronize their work. Five weavers from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao share their stories and the significance of their traditions to their lives. Florence Amily Ao-wat, 66, of Kinwa Etnika Handicrafts in Tabuk City, Kalinga, began learning backstrap weaving at 15. After completing an accountancy degree in Baguio City and starting her career, she returned home and noticed that their weavers were aging, and younger people were no longer interested in continuing the craft. “The young generation does not like to weave because they are educated and they do not see the worth of our weaving tradition,” Ao-wat said in a mix of English and Filipino. Seeing this problem, Ao-wat relearned and practiced weaving, eventually organizing her siblings to form Kalinga Indigenous Weavers Association (KINWA ETNIKA), a community of weavers established with a starting capital of P2,500. Kinwa, an Ilocano term for “create,” prides itself on being an inclusive weaving community. Ao-wat gathers women weavers, persons with disabilities, and nursing mothers to help sustain their panaglaga (weaving) heritage. “Ito ay natutuhan namin sa mga ninuno, and sayang naman kung mawala ito (We learned this from our ancestors, and it would be a shame if it disappeared),” Ao-wat told Rappler. “We have 21 designs in Kalinga and they should not be lost.” To keep Kalinga weaving alive, Kinwa provides cultural immersion activities for students, helping them understand and practice their heritage. “In a year, we can train up to 50 students. Some of our products are made by Grade 12 students who come for immersion,” she said. Kinwa also encourages these students to explore their own designs under the guidance of heirloom weavers. In the Visayas, young weavers also face similar challenges. For Daisy Rose Nanas, 24, and Celestine Marie Otian, 22, of Reyden’s Hablon — cousins and fifth-generation hablon weavers in Iloilo — weaving is a legacy they learned from their mothers and grandmothers. “Importante ang paghahabi dahil nagbibigay po ito ng trabaho sa mga taong walang income at maraming opportunities para sa mga nahihirapan maghanap ng trabaho,” Nanas told Rappler. (Weaving is important because it provides work for those without income and offers many opportunities for people who struggle to find jobs.) “[At saka] importante na matutunan ng mga kabataan ang paghabi dahil inumpisahan po ito ng ating mga ninuno, kaya kailangan po nating ipagpatuloy,” she added. (It is also important for the youth to learn weaving because our ancestors started it, and we need to continue it.) Otian echoed this sentiment, saying that many youth in Iloilo also show little interest in hablon weaving. “Walang ibang magpapasa ng kultura kundi tayo. Para ma-enhance ang tradition natin, to support local, and to earn an income,” Otian told Rappler. (No one else will pass on our culture but us. This is to enhance our tradition, support local, and earn an income.) Their weaving center is one of the main suppliers of hablon fabric for the University of the Philippines’ Sablay, the university’s official academic costume. Similar to the weaving communities in Luzon and Visayas, the inaul heirloom tradition in Datu Piang, Maguindanao, is both a source of livelihood and a symbol of peace and unity. In this remote municipality, rebel returnees from previous conflicts in Maguindanao turned to inaul weaving to rebuild their lives, finding renewed purpose in the craft. Today, their descendants continue the practice, sustaining their families while keeping their cultural heritage alive, just like the weavers from the Weaving for Peace Philippines. Isnila Bensali, 42, one of the descendants, learned to weave from her mother-in-law and the women in their community. “Kaya important talaga — and [I’m] very proud — na napunta ako sa lugar nila na marunong maghabi. Kailangan ko talaga ang paghahabi. Kung wala ito, wala kaming hanapbuhay, lalo na kaming mga pamilya ng farmers,” Bensali said. (This is why it is really important — and I’m very proud — that I ended up in a place where people know how to weave. I truly need weaving; without it, we wouldn’t have a livelihood, especially us farming families.) Meanwhile, Asgar Gulam, 35, Bensali’s brother and a designer, has been weaving for 13 years, learning the craft from observing his aunties. “Maliit pa ako, hindi ko inisip na matuto ako ng ganito. Noong tinitingnan ko ang mga naghahabi, karamihan babae,” Gulam said. (I was still young and never thought I would learn something like this. When I watched the weavers, most of them were women.) By watching the women in their community weave daily, Gulam eventually learned the craft and developed his own designs. He draws inspiration from what he sees around him — flowers, heart shapes, and bamboo gates — to create unique patterns for their inaul textiles. The concerns of the five weavers were also echoed during the first-ever Philippine Handloom Weaving Festival in Ilocos Norte, home of the inabel and binakol textiles. To support the country’s heirloom weavers, Dr. Julius Leaño Jr., director of the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Textile Research Institute (DOST-PTRI), urged Filipinos to stop buying fake or machine-made textiles. “Because you’re not just depriving them of their livelihood — you are depriving them of their culture. You are depriving them of their identity. And most importantly, you are depriving them of their future,” Leaño said. The DOST-PTRI also appealed to government agencies not to convert traditional textile designs into sublimation prints. “On behalf of the handloom weavers of the Philippines, we call on all of you to please refrain from transferring these beautiful patterns into very cheap printed products that you sell at very low prices,” he added. Leaño emphasized that heirloom fabrics are chronicles of the lives and dreams of various weaving communities. Ao-wat, Nanas, Otian, Bensali, and Gulam were among the 120 weavers from the 40 weaving communities who participated in the first Philippine Handloom Weaving Festival at the home of Gawad ng Manlilikha ng Bayan awardee Magdalena Gamayo, held from November 19 to 22. The event also introduced SalinHabi, a digital platform designed to preserve local textiles by showcasing woven fabrics across the country. The pre-launch of the Regional Yarn Production and Innovation Center in Ilocos Norte, a micro-scale yarn spinning facility converting abaca, banana, pineapple leaf, cotton, bamboo, and other natural fibers into threads, was also held during the festival. The festival also included a textile exchange, forums, a weaving technology demonstration, workshops, and exhibits. “[Events like this] help us in the promotion of our product and the selling, to be exposed, and to let the government know there are people who are working in the industry, and who are helping the people in our community employed by means of weaving,” Ao-wat told Rappler. For the five weavers, keeping their tradition alive means teaching their communities, passing the craft down to their families, promoting peace, and receiving stronger support through opportunities to market their products, as only with shared effort can their traditions continue to thrive in the generations to come. – Rappler.com",True,true,How loomweavers from Luzon to Mindanao keep their traditions alive,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/loomweavers-luzon-visayas-mindanao-keep-traditions-alive/,Rappler
"“The power to tax is the power to destroy.” In history, it was also the power to destroy corruption. The downfall of Al Capone, one of America’s most infamous gangsters, is the clearest example. Despite evidence of murders and racketeering, what finally put him in prison was tax evasion. In 1931, Al Capone was convicted for failing to pay taxes on his lavish, illegal income and sentenced to 11 years in prison. His case proved one thing: when all else fails, follow the money. This principle has been applied globally. In Italy, mafia bosses were brought down through tax audits and asset seizures. In Brazil, “Operation Car Wash” exposed a web of corruption worth over $5 billion, leading to hundreds of convictions. In South Korea, two former presidents were jailed for corruption and tax-related crimes tied to family conglomerates. Around the world, tax enforcement has proven to be the sharpest tool against corruption. In the Philippines, corruption drains ₱700 billion to ₱1.3 trillion annually (equivalent to 20% of the national budget, based on assessments cited by multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). From ghost projects and padded contracts to the misuse of confidential funds, taxpayers’ money is diverted to the private luxuries of the powerful. Political dynasties and their favored contractors thrive through joint ventures and undue influence, enriching themselves while ordinary Filipinos struggle. Meanwhile, social media flaunts their ill-gotten wealth — luxury cars, designer bags, million-peso lifestyles — far beyond what their declared incomes can justify. This is not just immoral. Under Philippine law, it is tax evasion, punishable by imprisonment, fines, and perpetual disqualification from public office. Transparency International’s 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranks the Philippines 114th out of 180 countries, behind peers in ASEAN like Malaysia (57th) and Vietnam (88th). Weak enforcement not only embarrasses the country globally, but it also undermines democracy at home. Corruption is more than theft — it is a failure in governance. It undermines the law, weakens democratic institutions, and erodes the moral foundation of society. If taxpayers see the corrupt escape accountability, voluntary compliance collapses. If foreign investors perceive dynasties enriching themselves through public funds, confidence erodes. Corruption acts like a hidden tax on investment, discouraging FDI and weakening economic growth. The consequence is clear: less revenue for the state, fewer jobs for the people, and weaker resilience for the future. To restore trust, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Commission on Elections, and the Office of the Ombudsman must: 1. Audit confidential funds and discretionary allocations. 2. Investigate joint ventures and contractors linked to political dynasties. 3. Scrutinize campaign donors who benefit from government contracts. 4. Prosecute relentlessly — not only contractors, but politicians and families who profit from corruption. 5. Enforce perpetual disqualification for convicted officials to end dynastic abuse. This is not just about punishing crimes. It is about spending taxes judiciously — not for the lavish lifestyles of the few, but for the urgent needs of the many: In my book, Reimagining the World Without Corruption, launched at Harvard Kennedy School, I argue that corruption is not only a political failure but an economic trap. It erodes public trust, deters investments, and worsens inequality. To break free, we must ensure that every peso collected serves the people — not political dynasties. A post shared by CSR Philippines (@csrphilippines) The global message is clear: Countries that hold the powerful accountable attract more investment and build stronger democracies. For the Philippines, the path forward is equally clear: follow the money, prosecute the guilty, and rebuild trust in governance.

"Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) engineers and contractors engaged in a number of infrastructure projects are the new faces of corruption in the Philippines — and deservedly so. But there’s an upside to Filipino engineers and their work. Many of our engineers have helped build solid infrastructures here and abroad. Many countries in the Middle East, in particular, have long recognized the contributions of Filipino professionals — engineers, architects, and other occupations — in building their infrastructures. For instance, in this year’s award of top engineers and architects in the Middle East 2025 by the news publication The Filipino Times, Philippine Ambassador to Oman Raul Hernandez said: “From groundbreaking designs to engineering feats that shape skylines and transform cities, their work is a source of pride for our nation, proving that Filipinos’ talent and expertise shine on the global stage.” Here in the Philippines, a number of conglomerates and their partners have put up flood control projects that highlight the good side of Philippine infrastructure. They exemplify the skills, talents, and hard work of Filipino engineers and architects, proving that under the right conditions, they do a good job. Some of these projects hit two birds with one stone: while serving its main purpose of controlling floods and saving lives and property, they double as parks that we badly need amid urbanization and climate change. Take the case of property and township builder Megaworld. Kevin Tan, executive director of Megaworld, recently uploaded a video of a flood control project in Megaworld’s 35-hectare township in San Fernando, Pampanga — the 2-hectare Rainwater Park in Capital Town. The facility can hold 3.7 million gallons of water equivalent to 6 Olympic-size swimming pools. Tan describes it as an “innovative approach that manages stormwater, protects surrounding communities, and creates a vibrant hub for leisure and tourism,” and “because of this, the area around Capital Town no longer experiences flooding.” Since its opening on May 6, 2025, the Rainwater Park, designed by landscape architect Paolo Alcazaren, has become a popular spot for recreation and community interactions, attracting around 200,000 guests monthly for Capital Town. Although the video is also meant to help sell Megaworld’s properties, it also gives a sense of hope during this time of the country’s worst corruption scandal. Similarly, the Ayala Group also recently highlighted a flood control project called the Rain Garden in its 46-hectare Vertis North property beside TriNoma in Quezon City. You can watch it in this video below: A post shared by Ayala Land (@ayalaland) Many are unaware that such a park exists given that it’s partly hidden from the busy TriNoma mall. “What looks like a peaceful green space doubles as a detention pond, designed to manage rainwater, prevent flooding, and protect the estate from erosion, all the while creating a serene view within the city,” says property developer Ayala Land in a social media post. Ayala Land had intentionally built the Rain Garden due to the flooding concerns in the area. It now also serves as a central park which people can use for exercise. Another good project that’s often been cited in light of the flood control scandal is the underground storm water reservoir beneath Burgos Circle in Forbes Town, Bonifacio Global City (BGC), Taguig. This project is a 60-meter-diameter reservoir that can hold 22,000 cubic meters of storm water, helping keep BGC flood-free. Burgos Circle is the lowest point in BGC, and the rainwater the facility collects eventually drains to Manila Bay. On top of the reservoir is a small round park with the Instagrammable The Trees sculpture by Reynato Paz Contreras. The Sy family has long been recognized for incorporating the problem of flooding in their projects. Who can forget how their SM City Marikina mall survived the catastrophic flooding caused by Tropical Storm Ondoy (Ketsana) on September 26, 2009? While half of Marikina City saw their properties ravaged by flood waters, SM Marikina stood above the disaster, becoming a symbol of disaster preparedness and scientific environmental planning. The 6-hectare SM City Marikina is built on top of stilts in an area that had been identified as high-risk to floods. Property developer SM Prime built its Marikina mall farther than the recommended 90-meter-distance from the Marikina River centerline to reduce the risk of mall damage in case of extreme floods. SM Marikina’s lower parking level has no wall enclosures, and its ground floor level was built 20.5 meters higher than the maximum flood level that had been recorded. “These features allowed water to flow freely through the parking structure while the mall area rests on the third floor lifted by the supportive stilts during extreme floods,” according to a case study on the project. The steps taken by mall developer SM Prime on SM City Marikina’s disaster resiliency resulted in avoidance of around P1 billion in losses from business sales alone during Ondoy. SM Prime says the “additional 15% in costs to build a disaster-resilient mall were more than recouped in avoided losses.” SM Prime has cited two other case studies of disaster-resilient malls: SM City Masinag in Antipolo City, Rizal province, and SM City Cabanatuan in Nueva Ecija province, both of which are in flood-prone locations. SM City Cabanatuan’s ground level parking area serves as a temporary catch basin for water that overflows from a nearby creek. The facility can hold 14 million gallons of flood water. It served its purpose during Typhoon Lando on October 18, 2015 when most of Cabanatuan City got flooded. SM Investments told Rappler that 30 of its 89 malls have rainwater catchment basins with a total capacity of 85,6010 cubic meters, equivalent to 34 Olympic size swimming pools. “These massive underground tanks, similar in size to swimming pools, collect and store rainwater from the street level, mitigating flooding in surrounding communities,” SM Supermalls said. In the case of SM City Masinag, its catchment basin collected 8,652 cubic meters of rainwater during Typhoon Carina (Gaemi) in July 2024. The town of Masinag is a flood-prone area because of the rainwater that flows toward it from upper Antipolo. SM City Masinag’s rainwater catch basin has helped solve flooding in villages such as the nearby Vermont Park Executive Village. These projects by SM Prime have been cited as models of disaster risk management in the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction ARISE Private Sector Alliance, where SM Prime’s Hans Sy has played an active role in the international board. So, why aren’t the engineering/architectural firms behind these notable flood control projects generally not involved in public works? Those in the know say the good guys don’t participate in bidding for public works projects since they’re aware they have to give bribes in order to win. Or, they know the biddings are rigged and thus don’t participate. Some of the big ones, especially the companies that are publicly listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange, don’t bother at all due to their good corporate governance principles and practices. How then should the Philippines move forward from the flood control scandal? Aside from all the steps now being taken on making the bad guys account for their misdeeds, one key reform measure that is needed but hasn’t been discussed sufficiently is how to inculcate integrity in the DPWH. The key steps needed are to professionalize the bureaucracy, institute meritocracy, remove the influence of politicians in appointments, and inculcate the value of good governance. I recently came across an article, “What is happening to our government civil engineers?” by former DPWH engineer Alvin Claridades, who related his sad encounter with an apparently corrupt former colleague in the agency. In his piece, he says: “If the government truly wishes to ‘build better,’ it must begin by rebuilding the morale, integrity, and dignity of its engineers. “Our civil engineers are not the problem; they are part of the solution. Given the right environment — one that values competence, shields integrity, and enforces accountability — they can once again become the vanguards of public trust and technical excellence. “Infrastructure is not merely about concrete and steel — it is about conscience, competence, and commitment.” This reminds me of what former finance secretary Jesus Estanislao, a strong advocate of reforms, once said, “My advocacy is good governance: corporate governance in the business sector; public governance in the government sector; family governance for families; school governance for school institutions; and personal governance for individuals. At the end of the day, it is governance at the personal level that makes a vital difference.” – Rappler.com Click below for other BizSights articles:",True,true,[BizSights] Not all flood control projects are bad.

"MANILA, Philippines – Business leader and former finance secretary Ramon del Rosario Jr. has put forth an important question that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has not yet fully addressed in connection with the flood control scandal: Why didn’t he use his veto power to stop the insertions in the “mangled” 2025 budget? On Monday, October 13, Del Rosario said in an interview on the One News business show Money Talks that Marcos cannot wash his hands of responsibility in what has been described as the worst budget in Philippine history. It saw P289 billion in net insertions by Congress in the 2025 Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) budget, of which only P26 billion was vetoed by Marcos. (Figures are from the People’s Budget Coalition’s analysis of the 2025 and 2026 national budgets.) “I’m sorry to say, even the President, when he said, ‘Mahiya naman kayo,’ (Shame on you), that’s a little strange for him to say because it was his budget to start with. And he should have been aware of what was going on, and he had the opportunity to veto a lot of these things,” Del Rosario said, referring to Marcos’ statements in his fourth State of the Nation Address last July. In his speech, Marcos exposed corruption in poorly done flood control projects. If he was not aware of what was going on, Del Rosario said “it should have been brought to his attention by the DBM [Department of Budget and Management] and the different department secretaries whose budgets had been mangled.” This way, Marcos “could have acted on it at least with full information,” and “if he did not have the information, his department secretaries were not doing their job,” he said. Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman has tried to distance herself from the mangled budget by saying she had no role in the National Expenditure Program revisions. The NEP, also called the President’s budget, is prepared by the DBM and submitted to Congress for review. Del Rosario, now a co-convenor of a multisectoral group called Roundtable for Inclusive Development, said corruption in flood control and other public works projects got bigger and bigger because of “greed” and because the checks against corruption failed. “More and more, it became a system where everyone was in on it. The way they did it was there was something for everyone: the congressmen, the senators would connive with the executive branch so that there were percentages given to everyone along the way, all the way, including the contractors. “And that’s the system that evolved, and because everyone was getting a share of it, everyone decided to be tight-lipped and it just grew and grew and grew, until it became the monster that it now is. And now everybody is saying, how did this happen? It happened because people let it happen.” The way forward, Del Rosario said, is to make sure those responsible are held accountable, especially the “big fish.” “You cannot get away with all of this and think that you can get it done by just going after district engineers…. You have to go beyond that, you’ve got to go to legislators, very senior people,” he said. Based on their conversations with people in the executive and legislative branches of government, Del Rosario said he believes “a growing number of them sincerely want to do the right thing,” although “some are in a defensive mode” because some forces are “exploiting the situation.” “But we’re being very clear about our position: stick to the Constitution, let’s not fool around with extra-constitutional ideas all over again. Let’s make our democracy work, is what we’re saying,” he said. He said the more than 20 organizations and 100 individuals in the People’s Budget Coalition, are demanding that the Marcos administration make sure that the 2026 budget is “in no way a repeat of 2025.” Based on the analysis by the People’s Budget Coalition of the 2026 budget, Del Rosario said it still had around P230 billion for pork barrel that will go to social programs that “make it sound like they’re highly needed.” He said the money should instead be allocated to the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program or 4Ps, which has very specific guidelines where beneficiaries are entitled to certain amounts based on certain school attendance and nutrition conditions. Del Rosario warned that the people’s anger will continue unless those in power “show serious intent to change things.” “I think we’ve got to wake up as a people and say we deserve better than this.” Del Rosario is chairman and CEO of conglomerate PHINMA Corporation, which is involved in education, construction, hospitality, energy, and housing. He served briefly as finance secretary from 1992 to 1993 during the Fidel Ramos administration. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Marcos, DBM can’t wash hands of ‘mangled’ 2025 budget – ex-finance chief",https://www.rappler.com/business/marcos-jr-dbm-responsible-mangled-2025-budget-ramon-del-rosario/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The long-awaited debut of Maynilad Water Services Incorporated or Maynilad on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) is finally happening. The country’s largest private water utility is gearing up for the biggest initial public offering (IPO) of the year, in a market where blockbuster listings have become few and far between. It will be the largest public offering the Philippines has seen in years, surpassed only by Monde Nissin’s record-breaking debut in 2021, the biggest IPO in the nation’s history. Maynilad supplies water and wastewater services across the West Zone of Metro Manila, which includes 11 cities and extends to several cities and municipalities in Cavite. It serves around 10.5 million people through a network of treatment plants, reservoirs, pumping stations, and pipelines. The company also operates related businesses such as waterworks engineering, treated bulk water supply, and wastewater operations outside the West Zone. To recap, an IPO is the process by which a private company offers its shares to the public for the first time. Investors can participate by subscribing to shares during the offer period. Once the shares are listed on the exchange, they can be traded like any other publicly listed stock. Maynilad’s IPO stands out not only for its scale but also for the timing and the industry that it’s in. The utility giant will be testing the waters in a sluggish market, with the PSE index hovering near multi-year lows and showing little momentum (READ: [Finterest] What does it really mean when the PSE loses value?). So far, the only other IPO this year has been that of Cebu-based fuel firm Top Line, which raised just P732 million — a far cry from the more than P34 billion Maynilad could bring in. As part of its congressional franchise, Maynilad is mandated to go public by January 2027, meaning this IPO also fulfills a regulatory obligation rather than just being a purely market-driven decision. Maynilad has priced its shares at P15 each, at the upper end of its revised range. The price was lowered from an earlier ceiling of P20 per share after consultations with cornerstone investors including the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the United Kingdom’s Mobilist program. At P15 per share, the company could raise as much as P34.3 billion in gross proceeds, making it the largest IPO of the year. IFC and ADB are set to lead institutional investors with investments of over US$200 million. The IPO, originally targeted for July, will have an offer period running from October 23 to 29, and the shares are set to list and begin trading on the PSE on November 7 under the ticker symbol MYNLD. Proceeds from the IPO will fund capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, including part of Maynilad’s P163.3-billion investment plan from 2023 to 2027. The program aims to expand water and wastewater coverage, construct new treatment facilities, and upgrade its existing network. Maynilad is not a fast-moving tech company. It is a water utility with predictable revenues and heavy regulation, which makes it a classic “defensive” stock. This means its business tends to hold steady even when the broader market weakens or experiences volatility. Over the past two years, Maynilad’s financial performance has been strong. Revenue grew by about 21 percent annually in 2023 and 2024, while net income rose by an average of 47 percent. Its concession agreement with the government runs until 2047, ensuring a long horizon for growth and stability. Maynilad is best suited for investors who want stable returns and can stay invested for the long term rather than those hoping to profit quickly. Still, remember that steady performance does not mean zero risk. Utilities are subject to government regulation, and rate adjustments can take time. Infrastructure projects also require large amounts of capital, so cash flow can fluctuate. These plans could also be disrupted by environmental or humanitarian concerns. The offer period runs from October 23 to 29. If you already have a brokerage account, you can apply for shares through your broker during this window. The exact process varies depending on the platform, but it typically involves filling out an application form and paying for the shares you wish to buy. Once your application is approved and the IPO lists, the shares will automatically appear in your portfolio when trading begins. For example, First Metro Securities allows online clients to subscribe to IPOs through its website by navigating to Account and then Corporate Actions and selecting the stock offering from the list. This feature is currently available only on the web platform, not the mobile app. If you are new to investing, there is also a fully digital option through Maya Stocks, the investing feature inside the Maya app. In partnership with DragonFi Securities, 2TradeAsia, and Philstocks Financial, Maya lets users open and fund a brokerage account with one of the above entirely in-app using their Maya Wallet, with no transfer fees. During the offer period, the Maynilad IPO will appear on the partner brokers’ pages inside the app, where users can select the number of shares they want and confirm their subscription. Before you make any decision to invest, it is worth reviewing Maynilad’s prospectus, which clearly shows the company’s financial statements, strengths, and risks. – Rappler.com Finterest is Rappler’s series that demystifies the world of money and gives practical advice on managing your personal finances.",True,true,"[Finterest] Maynilad’s IPO, 2025’s biggest, is coming.

"Gold and silver are on a tear — breaking records and defying gravity. Gold has soared past $4,100 an ounce, while silver has rocketed to more than $52, its first record in nearly half a century. The surge is but a reflection of global anxiety, as trade tensions between the United States and China flare anew. Now, investors are flocking to the oldest safe havens known to man. The rally is precipitated by a new chill between Washington and Beijing. Fresh tariff threats, tighter export controls, and brewing disputes over rare earth minerals have revived fears of another trade war. These are not minor skirmishes — port fees, sanctions, and supply-chain disruptions are once again reshaping global trade flows. Every time rhetoric hardens, investors run for cover — and the first shelter they find is in precious metals. Here are the key drivers: Trade war rhetoric has escalated again, with the US signaling tougher tariff and export control postures on China, especially in high-tech and rare earths. Investors, fearing supply chains shocks and global growth disruption, have bid up precious metals. The more the market anticipates that the Federal Reserve will shift toward looser policy (lower rates), the more attractive “non-yielding” assets like gold become (since their opportunity cost falls). The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) holds ~130 tons of gold (Q2 2025), up from ~127.5t in Q1. When global prices jump, the peso value of these reserves rises, improving the BSP’s balance sheet and the country’s perceived external buffer. But that’s a valuation gain, not spendable cash — helpful for confidence and reserve adequacy, but it doesn’t directly fund the budget. Why it matters: 1. Stronger reserve position A stronger reserve position can stabilize foreign exchange (FX) expectations during risk-off episodes tied to US-China flare-ups and precious-metals volatility. If the rally reverses, those gains can evaporate just as fast; the BSP treats this prudently. 2. Tailwinds for domestic gold mining (jobs, taxes, LGU shares) High gold prices improve margins for producing mines (e.g. OceanaGold’s Didipio; Philex’s Padcal with gold in copper concentrates). Their latest disclosures highlight robust free cash flow and ongoing reserve life, which high prices further support. More cash flow → more royalties, taxes, community shares, and potential capex. Small-scale miners benefit too. Since the promulgation of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act 11256, gold sold by registered small-scale miners to the BSP is tax-exempt and the BSP pays ~99.5% of the preliminary assay value — encouraging formalization and local sales. With record world prices, incentives to sell to BSP strengthen, pulling production into the legal channel and boosting rural incomes. Macro effect: More formal gold sales lift rural cash flows, raise Local Government Unit (LGU) royalty shares, and can modestly improve the current account if exports increase. It also deepens the BSP’s domestic bullion pipeline — strategically useful in volatile times. 3. Silver’s boom is a mixed bag for industry Unlike gold, silver is a critical industrial input (electronics, solar, electric vehicles). The present run — fueled by tight London inventories, elevated lease rates, and strong investment/Indian festive demand — pushes up component costs and squeezes manufacturers’ working capital. The squeeze has been severe enough to trigger air shipments and premiums over futures in London. For a country where electronics dominate exports, pricier silver can raise input costs for local assemblers/electronics manufacturing services (EMS) firms. Macro effect: In the short run, higher input costs can pressure margins and delay orders. Over time, exporters try to pass on costs to buyers; success depends on contract structures and global demand. With the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showing electronics as the linchpin of exports, sustained silver tightness is a mild headwind. 4. Jewelry, pawnshops, and household balance sheets Retail jewelry prices rise when bullion does. That hurts discretionary jewelry demand but raises collateral values for households which use jewelry for short-term liquidity via pawnshops. In a high-price regime, loan-to-value amounts improve — useful during income squeezes — though ticket sizes and interest terms still dominate outcomes. (Industry commentary has highlighted Filipinos’ inflation hedging instincts with gold.) Inflation channel: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) weight of jewelry is small, so direct CPI impact is muted. Indirect effects — via electronics and imported durables using silver — are more relevant but typically gradual. 5. Financial markets and the peso Gold up, silver squeezed, and US–China tensions typically tighten global risk appetite. That can support local miners’ equities on earnings upgrades, but broad equities might face risk-off flows if global growth fears resurface. For foreign exchange (FX), outcomes are path-dependent: if safe-haven dollar strength outweighs gold’s reserve optics, USD/PHP can still drift weaker; if the Fed easing narrative dominates, emerging markets (EM) FX (including PHP) can stabilize. Key swing factor: The Fed path: If real yields fall on dovish guidance, gold remains underpinned and global financial conditions ease — a friendlier setup for the peso and risk assets; a hawkish surprise would do the opposite. (Global coverage flags that 2025’s “gold mania” is already stretching beyond traditional drivers — raising reversal risk if the macro narrative turns.) BSP Gold Valuation (Sensitivity) Illustrative Mining Revenue Uplift (per quarter) Electronics Exporter: Silver Shock Sensitivity (Illustrative) Imagine that you have ₱1 million idling in the bank. The interest barely keeps up with inflation. You decide to divide it evenly: ₱500,000 in gold, ₱500,000 in silver. At today’s prices — ₱7,700 per gram of gold and about ₱70 per gram of silver — you acquire real, portable wealth. But what happens one year from now? Gold is trading near US$4,150 per ounce, up nearly 13% in the past month and over 50% year-on-year. Analysts like Bank of America now project $5,000 by 2026, driven by global uncertainty, central-bank buying, and fading confidence in fiat currencies. If this plays out, your ₱500,000 in gold could be worth roughly ₱600,000 — a 20% gain. Even in a moderate case (+12%), that’s ₱560,000, comfortably above inflation. The only major risks are a strong US dollar or stubbornly high interest rates that make yield-less metals less attractive. But gold rarely disappoints those who wait. It’s the “sleep-sound” asset — quiet, heavy, and timeless. If gold is the wise old sage, silver is its restless cousin — volatile, brilliant, and full of surprises. Currently priced at US $52 per ounce (₱3,030), silver has skyrocketed 67% in the past year. Industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles, and battery production keeps driving it higher. Should it reach $65 per ounce by 2026, your ₱500,000 stake would climb to ₱625,000 — a 25% jump. A moderate 15% rise still nets you ₱575,000. The metal’s volatility can cut both ways, but its long-term fundamentals are silver-solid. In a balanced portfolio, the metals complement each other — gold steadies, silver sprints. Here’s how your ₱1 million could look in a year: Even in the middle case, you outperform most local investments and bank deposits several times over. Gold and silver move not only with charts and central-bank cues, but with emotion — fear, hope, distrust, and belief. When governments wobble, investors instinctively run to the metals that never lie. Every peso you park in bullion is a quiet protest against uncertainty, a hedge against the manipulations of paper wealth. If you invest today, your story will not be about chasing speculative highs — it will be about preserving value while the world experiments with digital currencies, debt ceilings, and geopolitical gambles. A year from now, whether gold hits $5,000 or silver flirts with $65, you’ll hold something heavier than paper: peace of mind. Because when markets burn, the metals don’t melt—they shine. – Rappler.com Sources: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Bureau of Internal Revenue, Philippine Statistics Authority, Reuters, The Economic Times, Bloomberg, AP News",True,true,[Vantage Point] Gold and silver’s record-breaking run: A boom built on fear,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-gold-silver-price-surge-analysis/,Rappler
"Paramount Skydance on Monday launched a hostile bid worth $108.4 billion for Warner Bros Discovery, in a last-ditch effort to outbid Netflix and create a media powerhouse that would challenge the dominance of the streaming giant. Netflix had emerged victorious on Friday from a weeks-long bidding war with Paramount and Comcast, securing a $72 billion equity deal for Warner Bros Discovery’s TV, film studios and streaming assets. But Paramount’s latest attempt means the jockeying for Warner Bros and its prized HBO and DC Comics assets will not come to a conclusion swiftly. The Warner Bros Discovery board of directors on Monday afternoon said it would review Paramount’s offer, but was not modifying its recommendation with respect to Netflix. It advised the company to “take no action at this time” in regard to the Paramount Skydance proposal. Paramount’s $30-per-share cash offer includes financing from Affinity Partners, the investment firm run by Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, and several Middle Eastern government-run investment funds, and is backstopped by the Ellison family. Larry Ellison, the world’s second-richest person, is the father of Paramount head David Ellison and has close ties to the White House. The studio argues its bid for the entirety of Warner Bros Discovery is superior to Netflix, giving shareholders $18 billion more in cash and an easier path to regulatory approval. It said a Paramount-Warner Bros combination, which would be among the largest media deals in history, would be in the best interest of the creative community, movie theaters and consumers, who would benefit from enhanced competition. “We believe our offer will create a stronger Hollywood,” Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement. Separately, he said Paramount’s proposal offered “higher headline value, increased certainty in that value, greater regulatory certainty, and a pro-Hollywood, pro-consumer and pro-competition future.” Paramount’s bid includes Warner Bros Discovery’s cable television properties; Netflix’s bid is limited to the Warner Bros film and television studios, HBO and the HBO Max streaming service. Analysts noted that Paramount’s offer comes with its own antitrust scrutiny as a consolidation of two major television operators. Last month, Democratic senators warned that such a transaction would result in “one company controlling almost everything Americans watch on TV.” The combined studio would also have a greater market share than current leader Disney, and add to fears of consolidation that have hit the industry in recent years. The offer represents a 139% premium over the company’s value from before the buyout talks started, and bests Netflix’s $27.75 offer that mixes cash and stock. At a UBS conference, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said Paramount’s hostile bid for Warner Bros was “entirely expected,” but added that he was confident of closing the deal. “In the offer that Paramount was talking about today, the Ellisons were talking about $6 billion of synergies,” said Sarandos. “Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs? So we’re not cutting jobs. We’re making jobs.” In a regulatory filing, Paramount said that the Ellison family, which owns Paramount, along with private equity firm RedBird Capital, had agreed to backstop $40.7 billion in equity capital. The offer also includes financing from Kushner’s Affinity Partners, the Saudi and Qatari sovereign wealth funds, and L’imad Holding Co, owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. “A Paramount Skydance-Warner Bros merger would be a five-alarm antitrust fire and exactly what our anti-monopoly laws are written to prevent,” US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, said on Monday. The hostile bid “is backed by a who’s who of Trump buddies … raising serious questions about influence-peddling, political favoritism, and national security risks.” If Warner Bros accepts Paramount’s offer, it will have to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion breakup fee. Netflix, on its part, is on the hook for $5.8 billion if its deal falls through. The streaming pioneer is likely to face strong antitrust scrutiny, and Trump has already raised questions about its offer. On Monday, Trump said neither bidding party “are friends of mine,” and he wanted “to do what’s right.” He added that he had not spoken to Kushner about the Paramount bid. Netflix’s bid has already drawn sharp criticism from bipartisan lawmakers and Hollywood unions over concerns that it could lead to job cuts as well as higher prices for consumers. “While it is perhaps a sad commentary on the US that Paramount thinks its closeness to the occupant of the Oval Office will help it seal the deal, it is merely doing what it can to steal a march on its rival,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at UK-based IG Group. Shares of Paramount were up 7.3% on Monday. Warner Bros Discovery rose 5.3%, while Netflix shares fell 4%. Reuters had already reported, citing sources familiar, that Paramount had raised its offer to $30 per share on Thursday for the entire company, but that the Warner Bros board had concerns about the financing. “The Warner Bros Discovery acquisition is far from over,” said eMarketer senior analyst Ross Benes. “Paramount will appeal to shareholders, regulators, and politicians to try to stymie Netflix. The battle could become prolonged.” Paramount maintained that it would be a champion of Hollywood and its talent, would remain committed to releasing movies in theaters, and that its path to regulatory approval would be faster than Netflix’s. In its appeal to shareholders, Paramount said it submitted six proposals over the course of 12 weeks, but Warner Bros “never engaged meaningfully” with these proposals. The company said it had sent a letter to Warner Bros, questioning the sale process and alleging the company has abandoned a fair bidding process and predetermined Netflix as the winner. That followed reports that Warner Bros’ management called the Netflix deal a “slam dunk” while speaking negatively about Paramount’s offer. In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Paramount CEO David Ellison said there was an “inherent bias” in the bidding. – Rappler.com",True,true,Warner Bros fight heats up with $108 billion hostile bid from Paramount,https://www.rappler.com/business/paramount-bid-acquisition-warner-bros/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Malacañang assured concerned Philippine business groups that the government’s anti-corruption campaign is in full swing, after 34 organizations described the flood control scandal as having “eroded public trust” which “now threatens our national security.” Presidential Communications Office (PCO) Undersecretary Claire Castro, in a Palace briefing on Monday, October 20, cited various actions taken by the government. These include the issuance of lookout bulletins for contractors and officials under investigation, as well as various requests for asset freeze orders. “Nararamdaman po ng Pangulo at ng administrasyon ang mga nararamdaman ng mga businessmen kaya po patuloy ang ginagawang pag-iimbestiga at patuloy ang pagpapabilis ng aksyon para po mapanagot ang dapat na mapanagot,” Castro said. (The President and his administration feel what the businessmen feel. That’s why we continue to investigate and expedite action steps to hold the guilty accountable.) Castro also called out those allegedly trying to discredit the ongoing investigation of the Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI). She said that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. understands the private sector’s desire for results, but assured the business community that the anti-corruption crackdown was ongoing. Malacañang’s statement comes after 34 business groups co-signed a resolution urging Marcos to urgently address the corruption surrounding flood control and other public works projects. The 34 signatories include the Philippines’ influential business groups such as the Makati Business Club, Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Management Association of the Philippines. “We have contributed to the national funds through taxes locally and nationally and have paid additional assessment of taxes… Yet trillions of pesos supplied and intended to protect our communities from disasters have been squandered through ghost projects, substandard work, and inflated contracts,” the groups said. The business organizations urged Marcos to bestow full legal authority and independence upon the ICI, prosecute all those responsible, implement institutional reforms and recover ill-gotten wealth, and provide regular updates to the public. “This is more than a financial loss – it is a fatal breach of public trust that leaves our people vulnerable and outraged,” they wrote. Marcos formed the ICI in September through Executive Order No. 94 to probe alleged corruption in public works projects in the last decade. – Rappler.com",True,true,Palace assures business groups: Gov’t taking anti-corruption drive seriously,https://www.rappler.com/business/malacanang-assures-groups-taking-anti-corruption-seriously/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – How does P185 billion just disappear? That’s roughly how much market value vanished from the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) in just a few weeks. And while it’s not quite the P1.7 trillion that Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Francis Lim first claimed — a figure so wildly off the mark it turned out to be “fictitious” — the real number is still worrying. (READ: [Finterest] PSE may not have lost P1.7-T, but its weakness is still a problem) Taken at face value, it sounds catastrophic, but what really happens when we report such a loss? What exactly happened to those billions? Was it just destroyed, like torching piles upon piles of cash? If not, where does it go, and who’s paying the price? When analysts or reporters say the market “lost P185 billion,” they’re referring to a drop in total market capitalization, which refers to the overall value of all listed companies on the PSE. Public companies are priced share by share. Multiply a company’s share price by the number of shares outstanding and you get that company’s market capitalization. Add up the market caps of all listed companies and you get the market’s total value. The difference between two periods (say, last week’s total and today’s) is what we call the market’s “loss” or “gain.” Sometimes, instead of measuring the change in market cap for every single company in the PSE, only the change for the companies in the PSE index (PSEi) is used. In simple terms, a loss in market value means the total market cap of companies in the PSE went down because their share prices dropped. You can think of market cap as the crowd’s latest opinion, not a hard appraisal of a company’s factories, cash flows, or land. That’s why when we say that it dropped by P185 billion, it doesn’t mean that the cash literally vanished. What it really means is that, on paper, the collective value of companies has declined because investors are now willing to pay less for their shares. This doesn’t automatically mean that all investors lost that money outright. If you’re holding stocks that fell in value and you don’t sell, that “loss” is unrealized. It exists only on paper, reflecting weak market sentiment at a specific moment. If prices rise again, the value returns. But if you sell when prices are low, then the loss becomes realized, and that’s when the money is truly gone from your pocket. Prices move when buyers and sellers agree to trade at a new level. That agreement reflects lots of inputs: company earnings, interest rates, currency moves, liquidity, and risk appetite. It also reflects stories that change how investors feel about the future. Corruption headlines matter because they raise the perceived risk that rules will not be followed, projects will not get built, and bribes will erode profits. When share prices fall, it usually means there’s more selling than buying at those levels. But that doesn’t mean everyone selling is losing money. Some investors may have bought their shares much earlier, at lower prices, and are now cashing in profits. Others, especially those who entered recently, may be cutting losses or shifting funds somewhere safer. So, if your portfolio is flashing red, it doesn’t always mean every investor is bearing a loss. In fact, that dip you’re seeing might even be the result of a big institutional investor taking profit on a position they made years ago, back when the stock was much cheaper. Who exactly is driving this selling? In recent months, foreigners have consistently been net sellers, which isn’t something that’s isolated to the Philippines. In fact, that’s reflective of a regional trend of fund outflows from emerging markets. But in the Philippines, it’s particularly a big deal because foreigners still make up nearly half of all trading activity in the PSE year-to-date. Heavy foreign selling tends to weigh on blue chips, especially those with large foreign ownership. Retail activity tends to show up more in mid- to small-cap names or speculative counters. That’s why when foreign investors pull out, it can cause the index to jitter. But outflows aren’t always a “vote against” the Philippines. Across Asia, foreign institutional investors have been trimming exposure to emerging markets, driven by global risk sentiment, such as higher US interest rates, tensions in the Middle East, and portfolio shifts toward less risky assets like the US Treasuries. Meanwhile, some funds are simply rebalancing ahead of the year-end, locking in profits or reducing risk. We can never be 100% sure what is causing markets to move. We can say corruption likely contributed, but we should also be honest about what the data can and cannot prove. It’s not like the PSE publishes a footnote at the end of each day saying the market “fell 1.2% due to scandal.” Market movements are influenced by countless factors, such as economic data, global sentiment, policy signals, quarterly earnings, political rhetoric, and even social media posts. What we can do is look at evidence and make an informed interpretation, rather than assert a cause-and-effect relationship. For example, you may see several negative governance headlines in succession, a pickup in net foreign selling, and larger drops in stocks exposed to public works. That supports the narrative that governance fears weighed on prices. Another example is when REIT prices fall immediately after a surprise interest rate hike by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). Higher rates make bonds and other fixed-income assets more appealing than dividend-paying REITs, which may prompt REIT investors to sell. If price drops sharply right after such an announcement, it’s reasonable to link the event to the market’s reaction. But attribution is probabilistic. In the case of the recent sell-off, remember that besides the flood control scandal, there’s also the global backdrop of tensions in the Middle East, the US government shutdown, uncertainty over tariffs, and shifting central bank policies from the BSP and Fed — all of which may be top of mind for foreign institutional investors. It’s for this reason why analysts would say “The market retreated as investors reacted to…” or “The sell-off coincided with…” — to emphasize that we’re really only looking at correlations. For retail investors, the biggest impact of a market slump is psychological. It’s unnerving to see your portfolio balance drop, especially when headlines reinforce the fear about billions disappearing. But as long as you don’t sell, your losses remain paper losses, and they can reverse as easily as they appeared. Historically, investors who stay disciplined and ride out volatility often end up better off, especially when the fundamentals of their investments remain sound. It’s a different story if the company you’re investing in is directly tied to the corruption scandal. Otherwise, fluctuations like these are completely normal in investing and may even make the stock of a strong company undervalued and ripe for buying. That said, your response depends on your goals. If you’re investing short-term, you might need to rebalance to avoid being forced to sell at an even lower price if this downturn lingers. But if you’re in for the long haul and own solid companies or diversified funds, you can ride out this volatility. Investors who stay disciplined and resist panic selling may still recover as markets rebound. While the flood control mess may have shaken some investor confidence, it doesn’t change the fundamentals of most Filipino companies overnight. – Rappler.com Finterest is Rappler’s series that demystifies the world of money and gives practical advice on managing your personal finances.",True,true,[Finterest] What does it really mean when the PSE loses value?,https://www.rappler.com/business/finterest-explainer-philippine-stock-exchange-loses-value/,Rappler
"Executive Secretary Ralph Recto has declared in a statement that “better days are coming” for the Philippine economy. It arrives at a moment when President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s administration is eager to showcase its wins with inflation dropping to 1.5% in November — well below the government’s target band — while major credit rating agency S&P’s reaffirmation of the country’s BBB+ rating has given Malacañang a welcome seal of external validation. Recto frames these developments as evidence of a disciplined, more transparent governance culture under Marcos Jr., pointing to asset seizures, Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) freezes, and recovered kickbacks as signs that the state is finally cracking down on corruption. In his telling, low prices, a strong labor market, and a “disciplined” 2026 budget will pave the way for a stronger, more confident economy. But optimism must coexist with realism. Debt is rising faster than growth, the peso remains exposed to political shocks, and institutional credibility is still repairing itself after the turbulence of the past year. Whether the Philippines truly enters a “better, stronger” economic phase will depend, not on inflation numbers or international ratings, but on the country’s ability to confront the structural risks that soften the foundations beneath Recto’s upbeat narrative. Vantage Point does not dispute Recto’s optimistic claim. I concede that it is grounded in real macroeconomic gains, but it also sits atop a fiscal landscape that demands more caution than celebration. The same period that produced low inflation also produced a swelling national debt, which reached ₱17.56 trillion in October — a 9.62% increase from the previous year, and much faster than the economy’s own expansion. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth of roughly 5.2% cannot keep pace with the speed at which obligations are piling up, particularly as the peso softens from ₱56.145 to ₱58.58 to the dollar over the past year. That depreciation alone has inflated the peso value of foreign-denominated debt, tightening fiscal space even before new borrowings enter the picture. This vulnerability is deepened by a governance storm that Recto himself acknowledges but does not fully confront. The flood-control scandal, which began as a procurement anomaly, has widened into a larger indictment of the national budget process. Investors have taken notice. Public construction slowed during the third quarter as agencies reexamined procurement flows; foreign funds, already cautious, pulled back further; and the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) Index reflected the country’s governance anxiety with lackluster performance. The result is a market increasingly inclined to price a governance risk premium into Philippine assets — a premium that low inflation, on its own, cannot offset. His promise of a “better, stronger Philippine economy ahead” arrives at a moment when the administration is eager to reclaim the narrative. Inflation has fallen to multi-year lows, governance initiatives are showcased as proof of reform, and the Palace is intent on signaling renewed economic momentum heading into 2026. On the surface, the optimism is defensible: headline inflation sits at 1.5%, the country maintains a BBB+ rating with a Positive Outlook, and criminal cases stemming from the flood-control scandal have produced visible arrests, asset freezes, and restitutions. Yet the data carefully threaded through this political storyline tells a more complicated truth — one that demands scrutiny as the country’s debt climbs to ₱17.56 trillion and its macroeconomic pillars show signs of stress. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) sharpened this contrast when on Thursday, December 11, it capped 2025 with another 25-basis point policy rate cut, lowering the benchmark borrowing rate to 4.5%. That move, the fifth cut this year and the eighth since August 2024, officially places the economy in an aggressive easing cycle — one enabled by collapsing inflation, but driven by something far less celebratory: weakening growth and rising governance risk. The BSP move acknowledges that overall business sentiment “has continued to decline” due to governance concerns and global uncertainty, and that GDP growth “continued to weaken further.” The third quarter’s 4% expansion, down sharply from earlier quarters, marks the slowest pace since the pandemic-era recovery and reflects the corrosive impact of the flood-control scandal on investor sentiment, public spending execution, and capital formation. The BSP’s decision to ease policy rate, despite a fragile peso, underscores the complexity of the moment. At ₱58.58 to the dollar in October, the peso has depreciated steadily from ₱56.145 a year earlier, eroding purchasing power and inflating foreign-denominated obligations. Every incremental weakening now directly inflates the government’s external-debt burden — already a significant component of the ₱17.56 trillion outstanding stock. This is the structural tension at the heart of today’s macroeconomic landscape: easing monetary policy is meant to stimulate domestic demand, even though it risks amplifying the very debt dynamics that constrain fiscal maneuvering. Meanwhile, the economy’s fundamentals present a mixed picture. Private consumption remains the main growth engine, but real wages have only recently begun to recover; youth unemployment ticked up slightly in October; manufacturing output slowed in four of the last six months; and infrastructure disbursements — supposedly the backbone of the administration’s growth strategy — fell behind schedule due to integrity reviews triggered by corruption investigations. Foreign direct investment inflows, which peaked at US$10.5 billion in 2021, have moderated to around $7.8 billion in the first ten months of 2025, reflecting a cautious external stance toward Philippine political risk. The current account deficit remains sizable at roughly 2.5% of GDP, financed increasingly by short-term portfolio flows rather than long-term investments. Remittances could continue to provide resilience — growing 2.6% year-to-date — but even this stabilizer is insufficient to counterbalance the broader weakening of capital inflows. Recto’s positiveness, while not unfounded, therefore exists alongside structural vulnerabilities that demand careful weighing. Inflation’s benign behavior — below 2% since February — has indeed given the central bank room to maneuver, but the BSP itself warns that the easing cycle is “nearing its end,” and any additional cuts will be strictly data-dependent. It has revised its inflation forecasts modestly upward for 2026 and 2027, signaling early caution. Growth projections, meanwhile, paint a slower path than what the Palace implies: the BSP expects a “gradual” recovery, driven not by organic momentum, but by the lagged effects of monetary easing and improved public spending efficiency. This is not the language of an economy sprinting toward a strong rebound; it is the language of an institution preparing for a long, uneven healing process. The Philippines does have assets: a young demographic profile, resilient remittances, moderating inflation, and a central bank willing to act decisively. Yet the challenge now is credibility: fiscal, institutional, and political. The cumulative 2-percentage-point rate cut since last year may support domestic demand, but unless governance reforms translate into predictable budgeting, transparent procurement, and restored investor trust, monetary stimulus alone will not deliver the “strong comeback” heralded by the administration. The country must grow faster than its debt, restore confidence faster than scandals can erode it, and bolster the peso faster than external shocks can weaken it. Recto’s optimism may indeed prove prophetic — but only if the numbers, not the rhetoric, begin moving in his desired direction. The “better, stronger” economic phase will depend, not on inflation numbers or international ratings, but on the country’s ability to confront the structural risks that soften the foundations beneath Recto’s upbeat narrative. This is where the administration’s narrative becomes difficult to sustain. Recto’s emphasis on the Philippines’ better inflation numbers — a genuine achievement given global price volatility — neither neutralize concerns over the country’s debt trajectory nor calm markets increasingly sensitive to institutional instability. Price stability may support consumption, but it does not address the deeper risks posed by slower output expansion, rising refinancing costs, and a currency that remains vulnerable to both global conditions and local governance shocks. The government’s optimism rests on inflation data, while investors are looking at debt ratios, fiscal credibility, and signals from the political economy. It is no coincidence that Recto’s statement devotes substantial attention to the administration’s anti-corruption drive. The flood-control scandal — which now implicates lawmakers, Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) officials, and contractors — has evolved into a broader examination of how the national budget is crafted, allocated, and potentially manipulated. That the executive secretary finds it necessary to highlight arrests, AMLC asset freezes amounting to ₱13 billion, the auction of ₱38.2 million worth of seized luxury vehicles, and the ₱110 million restitution from a DPWH district engineer, speaks volumes about the scale of reputational damage the scandal has inflicted. Markets do not respond to arrests as they do to institutional reform, but they do react to credibility risk — and the scandal has already tightened scrutiny on the entire ₱6-trillion fiscal cycle. Even public construction, a traditional growth engine, has shown signs of deceleration, as agencies quietly reassess procurement procedures in the wake of the controversy. Foreign funds that had already reduced exposure to Philippine equities and bonds now cite governance uncertainty as a major reason for maintaining underweight positions. In this sense, Recto’s assurances of stronger governance become less a sign of institutional strength and more an admission that the Marcos Jr. administration knows market confidence is fragile and must be aggressively managed. The promise of a “disciplined” ₱6.793-trillion budget for 2026 reinforces this point. Governments do not promise discipline unless they know discipline is in doubt. The budget process — magnified by the controversies of bicameral insertions — has turned into a barometer of political influence rather than economic planning. Investors understand this intuitively, rating agencies model it explicitly, and the peso now reflects it through sensitivity to governance headlines. Recto’s optimism that reforms, tax enforcement recalibrations, and investment promotion efforts will revive growth in 2026 is plausible only if the government can rebuild trust in the fiscal system itself. The macroeconomic risks ahead are neither abstract nor distant. A debt-to-GDP ratio drifting toward 62 to 63% would place the Philippines at the edge of ratings-agency caution. A continued slide of the peso could widen fiscal gaps and further inflate foreign debt obligations. A slowdown in public or private investment — even marginal — could weaken the growth base needed to sustain long-term borrowing. These are not risks that inflation can offset, or issues that can be resolved merely by high-level assurances of a “strong comeback.” Ultimately, the Philippines stands at a critical juncture where credibility has become the economy’s most valuable — and most vulnerable — asset. Recto’s optimism is not misplaced; it is incomplete. The administration’s success will depend, not on inflation numbers or credit ratings, but on whether it can restore confidence in the country’s fiscal architecture, institutional discipline, and governance systems. Until then, markets will continue to price the economy, not on the promise of better days, but on the reality of rising debt, slowing growth, and a political environment still struggling to convince investors that the rules of public finance are stable, predictable, and enforced. – Rappler.com Click here for more Vantage Point articles.",True,true,"[Vantage Point] As BSP cuts policy rates, PH’s mounting debts weaken optimism",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-philippine-government-debt-october-2025-undercuts-optimism/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The market value of publicly listed firms in the Philippines has taken a hit due to investors’ concerns on corruption in the flood control mess, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chief Francis Lim said. During a Financial Executives of the Philippines (FINEX) conference on Tuesday, October 7, Lim said P1.7 trillion in market value was wiped out from the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) amid investors’ concerns over the flood control project controversy. However, in a statement on Thursday, October 9, Lim corrected himself and said the figure was based on a fictitious report. He also apologized. (Editor’s note: We have revised and updated this article, including its title and url, to correct the mistake. Please read Lim’s statement below: Waning investor confidence also caused the PSEi to plunge to its six-month low of 5,997.6 before returning to the 6,000 level on Wednesday, October 1. “Investors aren’t fleeing because of weak fundamentals; they’re fleeing because of weak integrity. It’s a stark reminder that corruption is a weapon of mass wealth destruction,” Lim said. Lim also warned that it is the government and the public that pay the price when investor trust is broken. “Because when markets are trusted, capital flows. And when capital flows, the economy grows,” he said. For Lim, the country’s “laggard” capital market also reflects what he describes as a “crisis of confidence.” The chief corporate regulator noted that companies generally still hesitate to go public, while a number of public companies choose to leave the stock market altogether. This is why Lim considers rebuilding investors’ trust as one of the SEC’s most urgent missions. He hopes to achieve this by strengthening the independent director system, making real estate investment trusts more inclusive, as well as championing financial literacy as a mandatory subject in schools.

"BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – The Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) Branch 5 in Baguio City recently dismissed the criminal case against Camp John Hay Development Corporation (CJHDevCo) chairman Robert “Bob” Sobrepeña and Fil-Estate Management Incorporated (FEMI) vice president Ramon Jimenez, after the complainants filed an affidavit of desistance and formally dropped the charges. The case stemmed from a ₱11.2 million hotel leasehold sale involving units at The Forest Lodge in Camp John Hay. Sobrepeña and Jimenez were indicted in August 2025 for “other deceits” under Article 318 of the Revised Penal Code after prosecutors found prima facie evidence that they had concealed the rescission of CJHDevCo’s lease with the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) when the transaction was made. The indictment was based on the complaint of spouses Monica Carla and Erwin Galang, who claimed they were misled into purchasing leasehold rights to two Forest Lodge units valid until 2046 — despite a standing Supreme Court decision ordering CJHDevCo to vacate the leased premises and barring it from entering new contracts. However, on September 5, the Galangs submitted an affidavit of desistance. The court accepted their withdrawal of interest, and after both Sobrepeña and Jimenez pleaded not guilty, the case was dismissed on September 11. Judge Jeanylene Isip-Fukai cited the complainants’ voluntary desistance as the sole basis for dismissal. The court order noted that the private complainants fully understood the consequences of their withdrawal, including waiving their right to testify or pursue related civil actions. Following the dismissal, CJHDevCo issued a public statement claiming the case was dismissed due to the prosecution’s “failure to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.” The statement was posted on the CJHDevCo-controlled Camp John Hay Facebook page on September 11 and posted by online Facebook news page Balitang Northern Luzon on the same day. In a strongly worded manifestation submitted to the court on September 12, City Prosecutor Christian Amistad said the CJHDevCo post was misleading and omitted the key fact that the case was dropped because the complainants desisted — not because of a court finding on the merits. “To the prosecution, the said ‘post’ or ‘story’ is simply an inaccurate narration of the events that transpired,” the manifestation read, stressing that no full-blown trial took place and that the court never evaluated the strength of the evidence. Amistad urged the court to take note of the online post, arguing that it had the “tendency to undermine the integrity of our justice system,” and that freedom of speech does not cover “wanton disregard of truth for purposes of personal gain.” In their affidavit, the Galangs acknowledged they had purchased the Forest Lodge units directly from FEMI, not CJHDevCo, and had since clarified that FEMI derived its rights through a 2008 Memorandum of Agreement between CJHDevCo, Fil-Estate entities, and BCDA. The Galangs declared that they were no longer interested in pursuing the case against Sobrepeña, Jimenez, or other CJHDevCo officials — except for two individuals, whom they reserved the right to sue separately. This case was the first criminal prosecution tied to transactions conducted by CJHDevCo after the Supreme Court upheld BCDA’s reclamation of Camp John Hay in 2024. The decision enforced a 2015 arbitral ruling requiring CJHDevCo and all persons claiming rights under it to vacate the 247-hectare property. The Department of Justice (DOJ) earlier announced the formation of a special task force to investigate post-rescission transactions and other alleged irregularities involving CJHDevCo and its affiliates. Prosecutors had hinted that the Sobrepeña-Jimenez indictment was “just the beginning,” raising expectations of further legal action. With the dismissal now formalized, it remains to be seen how the DOJ will proceed with other possible cases. In its public statement, CJHDevCo maintained that all its transactions were “lawful, transparent, and conducted in good faith.” It emphasized that the 2015 arbitral award allowed it to retain benefits from its decades-long lease and acknowledged the validity of third-party contracts extending until 2047. The company reiterated its commitment to protecting investor rights within Camp John Hay and implied that its legal troubles stem from “misunderstandings” rather than wrongdoing. – Rappler.com",True,true,Why Bob Sobrepeña won latest round in Camp John Hay saga,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/robert-sobrepena-wins-criminal-case-sale-forest-lodge-units-camp-john-hay/,Rappler
"On October 31, at the tail end of World Cities Day, UNESCO dropped the news: Dumaguete City was now UNESCO Creative City of Literature, alongside Quezon City, which was designated as UNESCO Creative City of Film. I was in the middle of a Halloween party in a Dumaguete hotel when I received the news from my fellow coordinators of this campaign. Forgive me, but I cried. Because this was always a pipe dream that felt possible, and now it was real. But a pipe dream is comfortable. Indulging in pipe dreams is safe, because there are really no risks involved, only pronouncements. You can just say, “I’ve always wanted to have Dumaguete become a UNESCO creative city” — and some sort of satisfaction gets sated in the recesses of your ambitions. The pronouncement is there, hanging in the air — and somehow that is enough. But it really isn’t. The best fulfilment of dreams is in the tangible. And there lies the rub: because most of the pursuit of our dreams actually involve risking it all — carving time out of our busy lives to fill out a fragile schedule of creation, despite the demands on our lives from other things we have also made commitments to — like work, like family, like friends; committing to accomplish the dirty work of untangling seemingly insurmountable paper work or bureaucracy, generally sweating out the small stuff; and developing fortitude of spirit, because you will meet constant disappointments, as well as the firewall of unhelpful individuals who do not understand what you want to accomplish. The road to dreams fulfilled is never smooth, never easy. Pipe dreams, on the other hand, are easy. One pipe dream I had indulged in for so long was Dumaguete City becoming UNESCO Creative City of Literature. As a writer born and raised in Dumaguete, I know — perhaps in the most personal sense how this city has carved a place for itself as an unlikely capital of the literary arts in the Philippines, helped for the most part by writers from Silliman University, like the Tiempos, who chose to stay in Dumaguete (despite the tangible promises of more fulfilled careers outside of it) and have made it the home for which they could steward, not just their own literary creations, but also foundational institutions that would turn out to be great contributions to the national literature. But much was at stake. To quote National Artist for Literature Resil Mojares: “In promoting Dumaguete as a UNESCO City of Literature, two things are important. One must see not only the city’s tradition and current status but the award’s potential and prospective value in raising the city’s visibility and promoting further development that will go beyond the literary field to sectors like tourism, education, and the local economy, as well as diffuse outwards to other places in the country. The stakes are high since Dumaguete is the country’s best bet for being a city of literature and I really think that if Dumaguete does not get this honor, it is unlikely that another Philippine city will.” In 2010, I was one of two Philippine delegates chosen as honorary fellows of the International Writing Program (IWP) in Iowa City, which just became a UNESCO City of Literature in 2008. When I was in Iowa for this very prestigious fellowship, it dawned on me that this distinction was also fitting for Dumaguete. Iowa City is small, like Dumaguete. It only has one major bookstore; same as Dumaguete. It regularly hosts international writers and literary conferences; same as Dumaguete. And it has the same vibe as Dumaguete — replace Iowa’s corn fields with the sea, and you will get Dumaguete, only with blonde people. In fact, Dumaguete writer Rowena Tiempo Torrevillas, who is a resident of Iowa City, calls that Midwestern city as her “blonde Dumaguete.” Iowa City is also a place whose writing culture is driven by the University of Iowa, the biggest university in town — essentially its own Silliman University. (The writer Robin Hemley, who ran the creative nonfiction program at the University of Iowa for many years, is actually married to a Filipina — from Siquijor.) The famous Iowa Writers Workshop — the grandfather of all writing workshops in America — was the model for the Silliman University National Writers Workshop, the oldest creative writing workshop in Southeast Asia, founded in 1962. In fact, both Edilberto Tiempo and Edith Tiempo, co-founders of the SUNWW, were products of the Iowa Writers Workshop, graduating in the 1950s: Edilberto for fiction and Edith for poetry. And when Paul Engle, the longtime director of the Iowa Writers Workshop, visited Dumaguete in the 1960s to be part of the SUNWW, the idea of establishing the International Writing Program came to him. He, in fact, invited some of the early alumni of SUNWW to be part of the early batches of the IWP’s famous fall residency. All these literary crosscurrents were already in place when I went to Iowa in 2010 to be part of that fall residency — which is probably why I felt so much at home there. Since I came back from the US, I’d been advocating for the idea of Dumaguete as UNESCO Creative City of Literature every chance I got, including at several editions of the 6200 PopUp, sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Negros Oriental, as well as in all my lectures about Dumaguete literature in various seminars and fora, including one on the creative economy at Silliman University, sponsored by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. In 2014, in my capacity as the founding coordinator of the Edilberto and Edith Tiempo Creative Writing Center, I even curated an exhibit at the Silliman Library titled Cities of Literature, which traced the link between Dumaguete and Iowa, with the blessings of the IWP’s Christopher Merrill. In 2018, prodded by former Dumaguete City tourism officer Jacqueline Veloso-Antonio, I prepared a white paper for Mayor Ipe Remollo to determine whether we should apply to UNESCO for City of Music or City of Literature. (You see, only the LGU can apply for the designation of UNESCO Creative City.) Naturally, as a writer, my bias was clear. But the pandemic put these plans on hold. When I gave a talk about this very same thing at the first edition of Dumaguete Literary Festival in April 2024, however, this propelled then-DTI Negros Oriental director Nimfa Virtucio to take the first steps and got me involved in the official application to UNESCO, with the blessings of Mayor Remollo. That’s the story. We submitted our application on the deadline: March 3, 2025. Truth to tell, the UNESCO application, which lasted from December 2024 to February 2025, took such a toll on my mental and physical health, and, by the end, I actually found myself getting sick a lot. The application — in its blank state, composed of eight pages with seven chapters of questions, with each question having their own sub-questions, and each one with a specific character count — looked simple, but soon proved intimidating. The final bid ultimately amounted to about 40 pages of well-considered responses, tackling not just the heritage of Dumaguete specific to literature, but also the plans the LGU has in place to make sure the sector prospers in the coming years. We persevered. Was it the sheer ambition, the “internationality” of it all, that was intimidating? I guess so. I was so exhausted and anxious I couldn’t even entertain some of the minor blowbacks to the effort from people you would think would be the most supportive of the campaign. (Some people actually thought we were applying for grant money. Where will the money go? they asked. But that’s not what the UNESCO designation is all about. We tried to reach out to many stakeholders in Dumaguete — representing the creatives, the schools, the publishers, the book sellers, the cultural workers — and form them into a technical working group to help us thresh out what the community wants in a creative city of literature. In the end, while we could not control some of the divisiveness, or miscommunication, or benign disinterest, most people in Dumaguete were very kind and supportive, even with last-minute asks.) In my darkest moments during those months, I actually felt I was so alone. That’s not true, of course. In the end, it was a coterie of friends and associates from Buglas Writers Guild and the Dumaguete Literary Festival who pulled me out of the darkness, and together we made it to the deadline. If there is one person to thank, it would be DTI’s Anton Gabila, who was the steadfast keeper of our light, the rock to all our efforts, never mind the mixed metaphors. There’s also the indefatigable efforts of former city tourism officer Katherine Aguilar, who provided the grease to get the LGU involved in the entire process. In the end, we did become UNESCO Creative City of Literature. I will take the road of gratefulness. I have always believed in the magic of trying instead of wishful thinking and pipe dreams; this was our attempt to make things tangible. And we were justly awarded for the effort. – Rappler.com Ian Rosales Casocot is the author of Don’t Tell Anyone, Bamboo Girls, Heartbreak & Magic, and Beautiful Accidents.

"MANILA, Philippines – “Ay, ‘wag yan…he’s a Pisces.” “Sis, I’m an Aries – you know I don’t do long-term!” “Gemini siya? I’m an Aquarius! Meant to be talaga kami.” Today’s dating scene has been dominated by astrology. Nowadays, you’re no longer just a quirky Aquarius or a passionate Aries – you’re also “emotional” because of your moon, or “non-committal” because of your Venus. People swear that compatibility can be determined just by your zodiac signs; it seems like the stars have been playing a more vital role in guiding people in making the right (or even wrong) decisions in love. Certain signs have even become non-negotiables, and birth charts have become background checks! For many, the stars really don’t lie, and “astrolove” – the intersection of astrology and compatibility – has been taking the dating world by storm. Dating app Bumble termed this trend after seeing a renewed interest in astrology from the Gen Z and millennials. After all, isn’t “What’s your sign?” one of the first questions people always ask on the first date? Bumble’s Astrology badge has become one of the top three most popular lifestyle badges in the country. Recent data showed that users in the Philippines who added the Astrology badge to their dating profile “experienced over 120% more average monthly matches than those without,” Lucille McCart, Bumble’s APAC Communications Director, told Rappler. This badge of your star sign on display allows you to share more about yourself without taking up space in your bio. It even allows you to filter potential matches by star signs. “Astrology has a universal appeal. It can be a fun conversation starter and a fascinating way to understand each other and build the foundations of a healthy and equal relationship,” Lucille said. But can this shared interest enhance your dating journey by helping you form more meaningful connections? Can it also help you find yourself? Bumble resident astrologer and drama therapist Monch the Mystic – Monica Lopez Gamboa – believes that your potential match can be found in the heavens. Using one’s natal birth chart, Monica can break down your astrolove journey by analyzing your signs, your love interest’s or partner’s, and even your love languages and coping mechanisms. Based on my insightful birth chart reading with Monica, I can confirm that astrology can be scarily accurate – as long as you keep your mind and heart open! Before my 1:1 reading with Monica, I was asked to send my birth place, birth time, and birthday – the basics of a birth chart. The reading then started with a presentation of my chart, plus a simple rundown of what I was seeing on my screen (for a first-timer, the chart and symbols can look very chaotic and overwhelming). I’m an Aquarius Sun, Gemini Moon, and Libra Rising. “Your birth chart is a map where all the celestial bodies were when you were born. This snapshot is captured from the exact location, at the exact time of your birth. This is your unique astrological thumbprint – a holistic image of a person which describes both inner and other circumstances and all levels of their personal history and experience,” Monica explained. “The process of understanding our birth chart is the process of embracing our lives. It is the process of radical self-acceptance,” she added, also tying astrology to mental health awareness (they can go hand-in-hand)! Astrology isn’t just for romantic connections – it can help you delve deeper into who you are as a person, friend, sibling, daughter, employee, and loved one. Astrology can supplement inner healing and mental health as serving as a guide in noticing trends and themes in our lives. “We can use astrology to understand first your connection with yourself and which parts needs more attention and healing. It is only once we have done that for ourselves that we are able to in a healthy way, create and sustain healthy partnerships,” Monica said. “It is first knowing your values and priorities to be able to attract people and opportunities that are a match. For other people, astrology can be a wonderful tool to connect and establish genuine relationships with other people.” Note that astrology – as many misconstrue – is not a fortune-teller or a final decision-maker. Rather, it is a tool that can affirm what you already know, or shed some light on hidden aspects about yourself. It can offer guidance or direction, and it lets you “take only what resonates with you” anytime. Several synchronicities in my reading were eerily applicable to my life. According to my birth chart, most of my signs are in the “Fourth House” (most of them Aquarius). The Fourth House symbolizes home and family, and Aquarius is known for being unconventional. Monica pointed out that “a lot has been going on in the home,” which rings true because my family life has been very unpredictable, unstable, and not your textbook definition of “normal.” My Tenth House – which is career – is in Gemini, which is the sign of emotions and communication. Monica said that these are typically good communicators and emotional story-tellers in media or publication careers – and yes, I am a writer! She also mentioned that I am a Libra Rising, which is the social personality. Libras are generally diplomatic, charming, and easygoing peacemakers, but also struggle with saying “no” and being people-pleasers to a fault (raises hand). My Venus – the planet of love and relationships – is in Aquarius, which means that as an idealistic sign, I am most attracted to partners that I can “mentally connect with.” Same interests, same humor, conversations, and even the same goals, values, and vision in life. Since Aquariuses thrive on friendship, community, and companionship, I am most likely to “fall in love with a friend first, who enjoys spending quality time with me.” True enough, my partner now was my best friend from work first. Monica also got my love languages right – words of affirmation and quality time. An Aquarius also prioritizes independence and freedom, and this manifests in my desire to be accepted and loved for who I am authentically; in my relationships, I need to feel like I can be myself 100%. Self-care also looks different for everybody – for the Aquarius, it means enjoying a variety of hobbies (also me) and grounding one’s self with light physical movement when we get “too stuck in our heads.” My Mars – the planet of motivation and desire – is in Capricorn, which means that when it comes to relationships, I am usually in it for the long haul. Even if most of my signs are Air (flighty overthinkers), my Capricorn Mars (an Earth sign) keeps me grounded in terms of long-term relationships and enduring commitments. When it comes to relationships, friends, or work, I have the “stamina” to build the foundation from the bottom up for it to be secure and stable. My partner’s sign is Leo – the confident, self-assured sign. Monica said Aquarius and Leos are compatible and complement each other: when air meets fire, it grows stronger. Air signs are typically chill, and may lack the “fire” to be ambitious. Leos can help provide this motivation and support. On the flip side, since Leos are typically set on a goal, an Aquarius can offer new concepts and ideas to expand his world and help him see the “bigger picture” in life. An Aquarius conceptualizes, and the Leo executes. Leos are usually artists, which also holds true! Monica also mentioned different communication styles between our signs, and how each one’s flaws may come out during arguments, and how to repair conflict better. It was a very eye-opening, validating session that affirmed truths about myself and shed light on personal areas to be aware of. Zodiac signs don’t just come as is: they have both “low road” and “high road” versions, depending on your level of inner work. For example, a “low road Aquarius” is an extremely independent lone wolf, while the “high road Aquarius” thrives in her “tribe” of like-minded people. A “low road Leo” is attached to his pride and ego, while a “high road Leo” is a leader who gets things done. A “low road Aries” is impulsive and self-centered; a “high road Aries” is a passionate leader who fights for the underdogs. A “low road Taurus” is stubborn and greedy; a “high road Taurus” is generous and stable. Astrology is not a one-size-fits-all, take-it-as-it-is approach. Like dating, there is more than meets the eye. “Creating stereotypes about each astrology sign is something so often done. It’s about understanding the development of each sign – the high road and low road – and where the person might be in their development. Even in terms of compatibility, we cannot just be looking at the sun signs of two people and need to take into account the entire chart,” Monica said. In astrology, just like how you can meet your match, you can also encounter your deal-breakers. “In astrology, aspects that are incompatible are often identified as planets in “square,” which forms a 90 degree angle, such as the sign pair Libra and Capricorn. Capricorns can can be seen as self-motivated, often focused on their own goals and valuing tradition, especially in relationships. While both like to initiate, Libra is focused on the other and in maintaining harmony with the other. This is evident in Bumble’s data, which revealed that over the last year (2022) in the Philippines, Libras on Bumble were the luckiest in love! They had the most matches of any star sign, followed by Virgos and Scorpios. When it comes to compatibility, it’s all about finding the sign that balances you out. Compatibility is complementary, and astrology can help you find out what you truly want out of a relationship. Some people do use astrology with passive dependence, using it to pass blame or simply saying “this is who I am, take it or leave it.” Astrology is meant to be a tool for spiritual growth, through understanding ourselves more. If you want your partner to join you in your astrolove journey, go for it! “You don’t need to be talking astrology jargon. Stay in the moment. Don’t preach, practice. Live your chart and observe your experiences instead of reading off what apps say and labeling yourself and others based on it. Use your observations, connections, and experiences of your birth chart to connect with your partner,” Monica said, and most importantly, to connect with yourself. “Let astrology enhance your connection with your matches rather than dictate it. Building a fulfilling relationship involves more than just the stars and the moons. Astrology in online dating gives you a chance to show off personality, and at the same time to also see if the both of you have that initial chemistry that we’re all looking out for,” Lucille said. “It’s always important to navigate relationships with an open heart and an open mind!” – Rappler.com",True,true,Is the love of your life written in the stars?

"MANILA, Philippines – After sharing the story of The Traveller Across Dimensions through an album and concert, nine-member Filipino band Ben&Ben is now taking it to new forms. Tracing back to their third studio album release in November 2024, their storytelling began with The Traveller Across Dimensions, which was the title of the album. The band introduced 12 tracks centered on the story of Liwanag, an animated character who was described as an inter-dimensional being who is on a journey to find inner peace. “Liwanag” (light) is also the name of Ben&Ben’s fanbase. By naming the character after their supporters, the concept highlights the shared human experiences of Liwanags. During the band’s 2024 interview on Rappler Talk Entertainment, band member Paolo Benjamin explained that the dimensions in the story serve as an allegory for the human journey. “We wanted to tell the kind of story in one album and one story arc which was etong album na ‘to. And therefore, parang yung Light, Energy, at saka Feel, ‘yun ‘yong dimensions of innocence, of struggle, and of maturity,” he said. (We wanted to tell the kind of story in one album and one story arc, which was this album itself. And therefore, Light, Energy, and Feel are the dimensions of innocence, struggle, and maturity.) Their first-ever major concert at the MOA Arena in December 2024 also shares the same title. The event expanded on their story concept by bringing Liwanag’s story on live stage through animations, projections, and music performances. The concert was structured into three acts: Light, Energy, and Feel. It reflects Liwanag’s story as she travels across three symbolic dimensions of the same name that represent the phases of the human experience. Liwanag’s story goes beyond the album release and concert, as two of its songs were turned into animated music videos. The visual storytelling for “Triumph,” the album’s first track, features Liwanag and her pet companion, Puhon (someday), as they battle a creature using the power of music. Ben&Ben described “Triumph” as a fight song, reflecting the band’s own struggles and those of their listeners who face similar challenges. Meanwhile, “New Dimensions” narrates the earlier part of the character’s story. It depicts her innocence before encountering hardship and pain. Through these two animations released last year, fans were able to further grasp the story of Liwanag. This year, twin singers Paolo and Miguel Benjamin released their co-authored book The Traveller Across Dimensions, turning the narrative that started with their album and concert into a written form. A post shared by Ben&Ben (@benandbenmusic) In an Instagram post, Paolo shared that writing the book allowed him to express his thoughts that music and social media could not fully capture. A post shared by Paolo Benjamin (@paolobenjamin_) “Magkadugtong silang lahat, yung libro, yung mga kanta sa album, at yung traveller plushie,” he wrote. (They’re all connected, the book, the songs in the album, and the traveller plushie.) Before the story begins, the e-book encourages readers to listen to their third album, with its 13 curated songs, to create what the authors describe as a full storytelling experience. Apart from the book, Ben&Ben also surprised fans with new merchandise, the Traveller Plush Series, which was released on the same day, October 28. A post shared by Ben&Ben (@benandbenmusic) Each dimension symbolizes a phase of human experience: Light for innocence, Energy for struggle, and Feel for maturity. Throughout Liwanag’s adventure, the character comes up with existential questions like, “What am I here for?” and “What is my purpose?” Meanwhile, at the end, it leaves readers with an important message, “To be present with love.” The Traveller Across Dimensions features vibrant illustrations by Puppeteer Studios.

"MANILA, Philippines – In a city where most of us rush from commutes to the classroom or the office and back, cafés have become “third spaces” — places where Gen Z and young professionals socialize, study, and hang out. These spaces have become small antidotes to the daily grind, promising a pause, a seat, and a ritual. While coffee’s familiar bitterness has long fueled Metro Manila’s mornings, matcha has emerged as its calmer counterpart: grassy, vibrant, and endlessly versatile. From ceremonial whisking to cocktail fusions, cafés are reinterpreting the green tea ritual for a new generation of café-goers. This reimagining of matcha takes many forms at up-and-coming, mom-and-pop cafés around Metro Manila. For example, in Forbes Town, Taguig City, each homegrown café offers its own spin on how to enjoy the trendy powdered green tea, reflecting the city’s evolving tastes and café culture. Here are some cafés exploring different matcha experiences, depending on your preferences. At Chotto Matcha, the focus is on purity and provenance. The café sources its tea from small, family-owned farms in Shizuoka, Japan, ensuring that every leaf is cultivated with care rather than mass-produced. Handpicked by the founder and ground with stone to preserve both flavor and nutrients, the matcha highlights the quiet craftsmanship often overshadowed by larger brands. Chotto Matcha’s interiors are warm and intimate, designed with wood-panel ceilings and walls that give the shop a clean, natural feel. A stone-textured wall frames the counter, where drinks are prepared in full view, emphasizing transparency and craft. Despite the minimalist design, the vibe feels cozy rather than austere: soft lighting, neatly arranged tools and utensils, and the occasional whisking of matcha create a sense of calm ritual. The menu includes Authentic Matcha Latte (P205) from Mt. Fuji, Local Matcha Latte (P205) for a sweeter note, Strawberry Matcha (P220), Matcha Lemonade (P220), Dirty Matcha (P240), and Hanami Matcha (P250). Despite the emphasis on tradition, they also experiment with playful drinks such as the Marshmallow Cloudy Matcha (P220), Ube Matcha Einspanner (P270), Banana Pudding Matcha (P270), Coconut Matcha (P250), and Matcha Float (P305). Meanwhile, the pastry case is stacked with matcha cakes, roll cakes, cookies, and the trendy “crookie” (cookie meets croissant) pastries, available in Matcha, Choco Chip, and Biscoff flavors and priced at P270 each. Matcha Mama stands out for putting green tea at the very center of its concept. This specialty bar builds its identity around it — from sourcing premium matcha from Uji, Kyoto to crafting drinks that highlight its versatility. Matcha Mama trades in a brighter, more playful aesthetic. Its counter is rendered in soft blush pink, accented by gold-letter signage and pastel tiles underfoot, giving the kiosk a distinctly modern look. The Classic Matcha menu lists familiar favorites like the Matcha Latte (P160), as well as the Spanish Matcha (P170) with condensed milk, Matcha Chai (P180), Lavender Matcha (P190), Matcha Horchata (P210) — its signature drink using rice milk and cinnamon — and White Chocolate Matcha (P230). If you want to take things up a notch, they also offer a Ceremonial Matcha line, which mirrors many of these drinks but uses a higher-grade, stone-ground powder traditionally whisked with water. The Specialty Matcha includes the Pink Sea Salt Matcha Latte (P240), Vanilla Oat Matcha (P210), Honey Matcha (P190), and Strawberry Matcha (P250), which adds strawberry milk and strawberry jam. The overall vibe is light and trendy, compact but stylish; a natural stop for anyone who treats their matcha order as both drink and small ritual. DEN by Nikkei takes matcha out of the teahouse and into something bolder. As the café arm of Nikkei, a Japanese-Peruvian fusion restaurant, it treats matcha less as a ritual of purity and more as an ingredient to experiment with. The place blends the warm aesthetic of a modern Japanese izakaya with a more sophisticated bar setup. It feels casual enough for drinks with friends and refined enough for date nights. The overall atmosphere is both contemporary and rooted in tradition — a space where late-night drinks and quiet ritual co-exist. Unlike the last two stops, DEN by Nikkei doesn’t wear its matcha heart on its sleeve. The menu skews toward Japanese-Peruvian fusion with little in the way of overt matcha offerings, which makes the new Matcha Grasshopper (P395) stand out. Built with sake, Giffard Menthe de Pastille, white chocolate matcha sauce, and fresh mint, it’s a fusion that leans into indulgence, reimagining matcha not as a calm ritual but as a playful accent in a cocktail glass. Because matcha appears here sparingly, its presence feels more like a nod to Nikkei’s Japanese roots than a menu filler. It’s a small discovery for matcha fans — not the main reason to visit — but a surprise in its fusion-driven lineup. Overall, DEN by Nikkei is ideal for adventurous drinkers who like their matcha with a twist and less about quiet ritual and more about sleek cocktails and bold experimentation. Better known for its brick-oven pizzas, Pizzulu offers a different approach to matcha through its café arm, Caffé Pizzulu. Rather than making matcha the star, Caffé Pizzulu folds it into a lineup of inventive specialty drinks. This is where coffee lovers and matcha lovers can meet in the middle, showing how matcha can thrive alongside espresso and other flavors. Pizzulu’s Forbes Town branch radiates sleek sophistication with its soft beige walls, marble textures, and golden lighting that washes the room in a gentle glow. Round tables, cushioned banquettes, and modern wooden chairs make the dining area feel both upscale and inviting, while floor-to-ceiling glass panels open the restaurant into the street, blending indoor polish with the urban view. The signature coffees include Seasalt Cold Foam Latte (P195), Coconut Espresso Slush (P225), which fuses the tropical taste of coconut with the bitterness of espresso, and the Banana Cereal Cold Foam Latte (P246), which blends banana and cereal flavors in a creamy, fluffy latte. On the matcha end, Caffé Pizzulu offers the classic Matcha Latte (P210) as well as the Matcha Banana Cold Foam Latte (P275), which adds banana syrup and tops it with a light vanilla cold foam. A space that balances coffee’s sense of productivity with matcha’s calmer ritual, Pizzulu feels elegant enough for focused work but relaxed enough for slow conversations over pizza and a caffeinated drink. These cafés show that matcha in Manila is no longer just a passing trend but a canvas: pure and mindful for the traditionalist, colorful and sweet for the aesthetic-minded, hybrid and playful for the adventurous, and paired with coffee for those chasing balance. Beyond the drinks themselves, these interpretations reveal how cafés in the city are shaping shared rituals for a busy, fragmented urban life. – Rappler.com",True,true,"A matcha map of Manila: Rituals, reinventions, and café culture",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/matcha-map-manila-taguig-city-rituals-reinventions/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Tourists, especially budget-conscious Filipinos who go abroad to shop at lower prices, often make shoe store ABC-MART part of their Japan itinerary to cop their favorite pairs of sneakers at tax-free prices. Starting in 1985 in Japan, ABC-MART grew exponentially across the country, opening more than 1,000 stores in just a few decades. Soon after, it expanded to other Asian markets. This concept of budget shoes eventually evolved into a new, more premium format: ABC-MART Grand Stage, first introduced in Japan in the 2010s. The Grand Stage concept leans towards the more higher-end selection of sneakers and lifestyle footwear, still curated for the mainstream sneaker crowd but with more thought on design, exclusivity, and the customer experience. After successful rollouts in Japan across key cities like Hyōgo, Sasebo, and Yokohama, ABC-MART Grand Stage specifically eyed Southeast Asian growth. And after expanding to South Korea, Taiwan, China, and Vietnam, the concept has made it to the Philippines for the first time. The store launch is part of a larger joint venture between ABC-MART Japan and Sonak Retail Group, which plans to expand both Grand Stage and Standard store formats nationwide starting October. Sonak Retail Group, a division of Sonak Corporation, operates over 40 retail stores in the Philippines, representing brands such as Onitsuka Tiger, ASICS, Molten, Mikasa, and Mueller, among others. “This is one of our first 4.0 stores in Southeast Asia,” said Koji Higashimae, CEO of ABC-MART Sonak Philippines. “We’re introducing not only a wide selection of top footwear brands, but also the spirit of Japanese service and retail innovation that has made ABC-MART Grand Stage a trusted brand.” Kabir Buxani, director of Sonak Retail Group, added that the Philippine ABC Mart experience was thoughtfully curated for this market — from its design, store layout, selections, and exclusive drops. The two-level store in Bonifacio High Street, BGC spans two floors across 750 square meters of sneakers, shoes, caps, and workout gear. Shelves of limited-edition releases and exclusive drops from brands like Nike, Adidas, Puma, ASICS, Vans, New Balance, Saucony, Salomon, Patrick, and Crocs merge with the space’s Japanese minimalism and modern retail design. The Philippines already has a growing sneaker culture, fueled by the resale market, pop-ups, online “pasabuys,” and other global retail chains. Competing in a crowded sneaker scene has its challenges; how does ABC-MART Grand Stage plan to play the game? The Sonak Retail Group said that the Manila branch has the concept’s first Wellness Corner: a dedicated area with a running space where customers and runners can test footwear performance and comfort. There’s also the brand’s ABCLUB loyalty program, which offers perks like cashback, birthday discounts, free shipping, and early access to exclusive drops. The launch of an official online store is also in the pipeline. For the Japanese company, it’s about adapting to shifting consumer habits. As observed through the years, Filipinos want a more experiential, personalized, and curated shopping experience, and ABC-MART’s Southeast Asia expansion plans to bank on this mindset, combining the retail experience with selective brand partnerships and lifestyle positioning to stay relevant in a fast-evolving industry. ABC-MART Grand Stage is open at C1, Bonifacio High Street Central, 5th Avenue corner 28th Street, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig, from 11 am to 10 pm on Sundays through Thursdays, and until 11 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Japan’s ABC-MART Grand Stage steps into Manila, eyes Southeast Asia growth",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/style/japan-abc-mart-opens-manila-expansion-southeast-asia/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines —Two masters of Japanese cuisine bring their expertises to one intimate omakase table at The Counter at Ginza One, Makati City on October 12-19. “Masters in Harmony” is a weeklong omakase experience, where chef Masahiko Kodama and chef Kengo Tomita from Japan will display the precision and soul that comes with Japanese craftsmanship. From yakitori to wagyu, these chefs serve up different forms and expressions of their beloved specialties. Hailing all the way from Japan for this multicourse experience is Kodama, dubbed the “Yakitori God.” His restaurant in Tokyo, Yakitori Masakichi, had been awarded the Michelin Bib Gourmand Distinction. He has been featured in Netflix’s Ugly Delicious episode on barbecue, earning an emotional hug from the host, David Cheng, after he tried his yakitori. This is where Ginza and Ginza One owners Pepper and Jae Guanio first heard of him. On a family visit to Japan, the couple took a long walk just to try his iconic yakitori. And the journey proved to be worth it after just one bite — the yakitori was as good as its reviews. After great efforts and a lot of convincing, Kodama finally visited Manila and eventually agreed on the collaboration with the family-owned yakitori restaurant, which opened in 2024. Kodama helms the creation of The Counter’s yakitori menu, utilizing almost every piece of the chicken in simple but exquisitely tasting ways; he retains most of his signatures while experimenting with seasonal ingredients and new techniques. Kodama now flies to Manila every month for a week or so to do constant R&D and menu improvement with the Guanio family. This time, Kodama is working with another set of hands as Tomita brings his neo-washuku style of modern Japanese cuisine to The Counter’s kitchen for the first time. Tomita has been all around the world, spending 20 years in Spain at three-Michelin-starred restaurant Arzak, then working in Dubai and the Maldives. He later made his way to the Philippines as the executive chef of the premiere resort, Amanpulo. In June, he was appointed executive chef of the Ginza Group, refining the kitchen’s techniques and menu with his modern yet authentic culinary style, with 30 years of international culinary experience under his belt. These two culinary masters from Japan will thoughtfully curate a tasting menu this month at The Counter, an extension of the Ginza One restaurant located on the ground floor of Ecoplaza Building, Chino Roces Avenue Extension in Makati City. Guests won’t know the exact menu until they are seated — since it is an omakase, the night’s dishes are completely up to the chefs. Limited seats are available for the multicourse lunch or dinner. Guests can reserve their spot by calling +639176212171 or messaging on Instagram. — Steph Arnaldo and Alyana Fabella/Rappler.com Alyana Fabella is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the Ateneo de Manila University.",True,true,"Two Japanese chefs, one omakase: A weeklong experience at The Counter",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/masters-of-harmony-omakase-the-counter-ginza-one-october-2025/,Rappler

"MANILA, Philippines – Since her grandparents’ departure from the Philippines before Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law, Gabriella Buba had a long time coming before setting foot in the country again in 2002. Diving into what her family had left after being forced to leave, she drew inspiration from her own history when she started putting the Stormbringer Saga together. She has always been honored to share her heritage to anyone, despite the societal pressure of wanting to put an authentic Filipino story on paper. Statements like “you’re not Filipino enough” and “you’re not queer enough” lingered in how she saw herself as a queer, mixed Filipina just trying to write stories. A post shared by Fully Booked (@_fullybooked) Her first book, Saints of Storm and Sorrow, is dedicated to “girls swallowing down their fury like broken glass.” Released in June 2024, the book talks about women’s behavior in a patriarchal society and how such pressure builds up, causing it to burst at the last second. Her launch for the second book was an upgrade from the first, as she had the opportunity to debut Daughters of Flood and Fury in London in June this year. The sequel tackles breaking trust, narrow-minded rivalry, and testing loyalty as the characters find their ways to stand up against a more powerful evil. Rappler had a chance to sit down with Filipina-Czech author Gabriella Buba for an intimate talk about her journey as a writer, embracing her bisexuality as a woman, and promoting Filipino culture. What do you think is considered authentic bisexual representation to you, and how did you incorporate this view in the Stormbringer Saga? There was this moment where [I was] writing very unique personal experience stories. And [I wasn’t] questioning if, “Maybe that’s not my experience of queerness, or maybe not my experience of being Filipino,” but there are so many ways to be Filipino and to be queer. And there was this space, and then I think we reacted badly to it as a society. A lot of people were like, “Oh, you’re not Filipino enough.” “You’re not queer enough.” “You shouldn’t be telling that story.” It’s not what I think of my identity. I think, what I hope to do is really to just write from my own personal perspective, and maybe that resonates with someone else, but maybe it doesn’t, and maybe it’s just a window to a wider world for them. In your current and future works, how do you approach bisexuality not just as an identity, but as a lens in challenging world views? I really like to approach writing with a queer lens. Because so much of our world is built around patriarchal and western social structures, ideas, and religions, I like to peel back those layers, especially Filipino like, before Western influence. There was so much more openness around gender and sexuality, and there weren’t these hard boxes that, like, Westerners like to put around people. And I really like to bring that back and take a look at our stories and our history, keeping that openness in mind. You drew inspiration from Filipino folklore and the history of Spanish colonization in the Philippines. How did these folklore and historical events shape your perspective on our culture despite being away from it physically? For me, it was about kind of unpacking the generational trauma and the generational stories that came with my family. My grandmother was a poet and a big storyteller as well, and she had all of these stories. My grandmother lived a very hard life. They weren’t all good stories, but they needed to be shared. And I think for me, writing these books was a way of unpacking that grief and anger at the things that forced my family to leave the Philippines and feel like they couldn’t go back. My grandparents left right before the Marcos regime and really didn’t go back until 2002. That was the last time they went back so they really were not a family that went back and forth so I kind of really wanted to unpack the kind of generational trauma that like my family has and reconnect it with history and the beautiful parts of their family and their story that they shared. Their house was full of beautiful Filipino mother of pearls and Filipino cultural items. My grandmother collected seashell art and the statues. And my grandfather was a woodcarver. He was from Laguna, and he did beautiful work. How did you balance paying homage to Filipino cultural elements while making them accessible to those unfamiliar with the culture? This is a funny one. I wanted to put a glossary — but my editor, who is an English woman, said, “They can Google.” And I replied, “Are you sure? I mean, I have the glossary.” [My editor says] “I think it’s very clear from context.” [The] number one thing that white readers tell me, they’re like, “I wish there was a glossary,” and I’m like, my editor says you don’t need one. It’s hard when you’re trying to provide for your readers and the editor is holding you back. I think my editor really believes that these worlds stand on their own, and she is such a deep reader of fantasy that for her they do, I think there’s a type of reader that wants more things handed to them on a plate. But there’s also a type of reader that wants to work for it. They want to find that story, that hidden gem that makes them work for it and makes them really think and experience new things. That’s who I’m writing for. I’m not writing for someone who wants to be spoonfed the history of the Philippines. That’s not what this book is. When one writes, it’s as if you dedicate your pieces to this specific reader. In your mind, who are you writing for? When I write, I’m taking something that I’m struggling with and I’m pinning it down on the page for myself. I wrote Saints of Storm and Sorrow for all the girls swallowing down their fury like broken glass. I really feel like… especially for women in modern society, we have to be poised. You can never lose your temper, you can never raise your voice, you have to be professional. And you live like that [for years] but they build up, and at some point you can’t keep bottling it up. And I think at some point, you need to reach in there, pull it out, and make it other people’s problems. I mean that in a nice way, but I also mean it in a not nice way. Sometimes that has to come out. And if that’s ugly, so be it. And that’s what I wrote Saints of Storm and Sorrow about. Whatever it is that you’ve got tangled up inside, in order to fix it, you’re never going to untangle it inside. You’ve got to get it out. You have to find community and find the place where you can begin addressing and healing that kind of feeling inside. – Juliana Chloe Gonzales/Rappler.com",True,true,"Q&A: Author Gabriella Buba on Filipino pride, ‘romantasy,’ and queerness",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/literature/interview-filipina-czech-author-gabriella-buba/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Social Security System (SSS) marked 2025 with a landmark three-year pension reform that will increase benefits without increasing contribution rates. Starting September 1, the state pension fund raised retirement and disability pensions by 10%, while death and survivor pensions will be increased by 5%. SSS president and Chief Executive Officer Robert Joseph Montes De Claro said the state pension fund will carry out the second tranche of pension hikes on September 1, 2026. The final wave of pension hikes will take effect in September 2027. By the end of the three-year program, benefits for retirement and disability pensioners will have increased by 33% while death and survivor pensioners’ benefits are estimated to grow 16%. This will cover over 3.8 million SSS pensioners, including 2.6 million retirement or disability pensioners and 1.2 million survivor pensioners. Apart from pension increases, the SSS also aims to launch a micro loan program in early 2026. Its emergency loan program with a 7% interest rate from the original 10% will also be available until December 2026 or until the state of national calamity is lifted. De Claro earlier said the pension hike will shorten its fund life to 2049 from 2053. But he is confident that this will be offset by stronger cash flows from previous contribution increases and enhanced collection efforts. “Our actuarial team confirms that the fund remains financially sound. We are committed to restoring fund life back to 2053 through coverage expansion and improved collection efficiency,” he said. The SSS in January implemented a 1% contribution hike to 15% from 14% as part of a rate hike that started in 2019. As of September 2024, the SSS has nearly P55 billion in assets and has P11.3 billion in reserves for the future payment of employee compensation claims. De Claro previously said they expect SSS’ net income growth to slow down in 2025 as the fund implements the three-year pension hike. However, he remains optimistic that the pension fund will make at least P100 billion. The SSS made a P90.2 billion profit in 2024, with earnings from the fund’s investments contributing more than half of its bottomline. The SSS currently has around P500 billion invested in long-term government securities while the remaining 45% of the fund’s portfolio is invested in the capital market and real estate.

"On November 6, Thursday, the Institute for Solidarity in Asia (ISA) will mark its 25th anniversary — a milestone that, in a just and rational world — should be a national celebration. For a quarter of a century, ISA has worked quietly and methodically to transform how government works in the Philippines. It has coached bureaucracies into coherence, trained civil servants to think in terms of outcomes rather than excuses, and built a governance framework — the Performance Governance System (PGS) — that has turned public agencies once mired in inefficiency into models of competence. ISA’s achievements are real and measurable. Hundreds of public institutions have passed through its stages of reform, learning the vocabulary of accountability and strategy. The organization’s founders, led by the economist Jesus P. Estanislao, have done something extraordinary: they have attempted to make integrity procedural. In a country where reform has long been equated with rhetoric, ISA has given reform a grammar, a syntax, and, most crucially, a system. A post shared by Institute for Solidarity in Asia (@isacenterph) And yet, corruption remains, hydra-headed and unbowed, breeding faster than reform can chase it. As the anniversary approaches, one cannot help but ask: How can corruption remain so deep, so resilient, so omnipresent — if the nation’s most respected governance reform movement has been at work for 25 years? Every honest answer to that question must begin with Ferdinand E. Marcos. His two-decade regime did not invent corruption; it normalized it. It wove it into the muscle memory of the government. Marcos transformed graft from moral failure into a political operating system — institutionalizing bribery, patronage, and plunder so thoroughly that even after his ouster in 1986, the habits he created proved ineradicable. His dictatorship taught an entire generation that loyalty is currency, silence is virtue, and power is its own moral justification. When democracy returned, the old culture did not retreat; it simply adapted. It hid beneath democratic forms, disguising self-interest as public service, impunity as “business as usual.” The Marcos years did not merely damage institutions; they retrained the Filipino conscience, dulling its sensitivity to corruption. It left behind a moral infrastructure — invisible yet indestructible — that every reformer since has had to fight against. Nothing reveals this more starkly than the recent flood control scandal — billions of pesos siphoned from public coffers, disguised as infrastructure. Roads to nowhere, culverts to ghost towns, and budgets swollen like rivers after rain. This latest scandal is almost a parody of itself — a rerun so familiar that outrage has grown weary. It exposes the aching contrast between the world ISA envisions and the one we still inhabit. On one hand, civil servants stand on podiums declaring “good governance” and “institutional transformation,” armed with scorecards, strategy maps, and multi-sector councils. On the other hand, politicians and bureaucrats quietly arrange the diversion of flood funds while the real floods — of water, of waste, of moral decay — drown the very communities they swore to protect. It is as though two republics exist within the same archipelago: one that ISA is patiently constructing, and another that corruption has long claimed as its own. ISA’s model assumes that corruption can be countered by systems — that if you introduce discipline, define measurable goals, and reward merit, good governance will follow. The Performance Governance System (PGS) is, in this sense, a triumph of technocratic rationality. But corruption, in the Philippines, is not a systems problem. It is a cultural inheritance — part survival strategy, part social expectation, wholly human. It resides not in policies but in instincts: the impulse to protect kin before country, to conflate generosity with bribery, to mistake cunning for intelligence. ISA has done what few organizations have dared to do: it has built the architecture of integrity. But architecture cannot by itself change the climate. The Philippines remains humid with cynicism —a country where good governance is admired in theory and betrayed in practice. ISA can measure compliance, but it cannot measure conscience. It can teach institutions how to perform with efficiency, but not how to blush with shame. The enduring tension between ISA’s advocacy and the nation’s reality lies in what might be called the divide between framework and flesh. Frameworks are elegant, ordered, and moral by design. Flesh — the human element — is impulsive, fragile, and endlessly self-justifying. A government agency may earn “Institutionalized” status under the PGS yet still play the old game of political patronage. A local executive may quote ISA’s mission in speeches yet quietly sign off on padded contracts. It is not hypocrisy so much as dual citizenship: one foot in the Republic of Reform, the other in the Kingdom of Kickbacks. The Philippine bureaucracy often lives in two realities — the formal and the informal, the aspirational and the transactional. Reform frameworks like the PGS operate in the formal world, where metrics matter and ideals are displayed. But corruption thrives in the informal one, where personal debts and family loyalties decide everything. Until those two worlds are reconciled — until governance becomes not just procedural but cultural — corruption will always have the upper hand. And yet, dismissing ISA as futile would be unfair — even cruel. Over the past 25 years, the Institute has produced “Islands of Good Governance” — hospitals that serve with compassion, local governments that plan with foresight, and agencies that deliver measurable results. These are not illusions; they are proofs of concept. But every island, no matter how virtuous, is surrounded by an ocean. And the waters — turbulent, polluted, morally treacherous — remain unchanged. ISA’s challenge for its next 25 years is not to multiply islands, but to transform the sea itself. To make good governance not an exception to Filipino culture, but its expression. That, of course, is not a technical task. It is a spiritual one. What perhaps haunts the Philippine reform story most is the peculiar fatalism of its people — the quiet belief that corruption is inevitable, like traffic or typhoons. We speak of graft with the same weary humor we reserve for bad weather. This surrender — subtle, smiling, collective — is the oxygen corruption breathes. ISA can design systems of accountability, but it cannot yet design outrage. It can build performance dashboards, but it cannot build citizens who refuse to look away. Until Filipinos cease to tolerate corruption — until we treat it not as inconvenience but as desecration — no reform, however noble, can fully prevail. As November 6 draws near, and ISA commemorates 25 years of laborious, hopeful work, the celebration must also be a moment of reckoning. The Institute has proven that reform is possible — but the Republic has shown that reform is not yet sufficient. ISA has unquestionably illuminated what good governance can be. The question is whether the Philippines — bruised, cynical, addicted to shortcuts— truly wants to be governed well. Corruption endures not because ISA has failed, but because we have refused to evolve. We remain, as ever, a nation of extraordinary intelligence and astonishing tolerance — outraged by scandal in public, and yet privately resigned to its inevitability. On November 6, as reformers gather to mark a quarter century of hope, perhaps the truest way to honor ISA’s legacy is not through ceremony but through a collective and individual examination of conscience — to finally confront the moral paradox that has defined and shackled us: that in the Philippines, the architecture of integrity stands tall, yet beneath it, the foundations are still quietly eroding.

"MANILA, Philippines – Balancing college finals, thesis deadlines, extracurricular work, and part-time jobs is challenging as a student, and self-care is often the first thing to slide when life gets busy, leading to breakouts, dark circles, and visible stress. We tend to forget that self-care is fundamental: it’s the foundation that supports long nights of study, demanding presentations, and everyday errands. How we care for ourselves also influences our mood and confidence. Building a personalized self-care kit is one way to keep that foundation strong, and taking care of ourselves and feeling good is the best investment we can make. Here are a few Rappler-approved local brands that offer personalized care suited to busy lifestyles. Local brand Kaleia operates both a physical store and a website, importing a variety of authentic Olive Young skincare and makeup products in the Philippines. Olive Young is a well-established South Korean cosmetics, beauty, and health chain that first opened in Seoul in 1999. Since its launch, Kaleia has gradually introduced a selection of beloved cult-favorite Korean skincare brands, including BOH Bioheal, Color Gram, Wake Make, Bring Green, and Marvin as part of its newest roster. Some item picks include BOH Bioheal’s Probioderm Collagen Remodeling Serum Pads are toner-infused pads that combine collagen and probiotics, designed to support skin firmness and hydration, while Bring Green takes an eco-conscious approach with natural ingredients. The Bring Green Tea Cica Soothing Cream is a lightweight gel-cream formulated to soothe redness and irritation with tea tree and madecassoside to help calm acne and strengthen the skin’s barrier. On the makeup side, WakeMake has gained a following for its Blurring Pot — a multi-use tint with a soft, velvety finish and creamy texture that works well on lips and cheeks, available in subtle shades like raw pink, muted beige, and blessing coral. Color Gram follows a more playful and vibrant approach with eye-catching packaging. The Tintin Dory Lip Jam features a jelly-like texture inspired by fruit jams, offering a glossy, plumper finish. Meanwhile, the Fruity Glass Tint provides a vivid color payoff with a glassy shine, without feeling sticky. For other skincare needs, Pure Culture, a Filipino skincare brand founded by three women, was born from a mission to create gentle yet effective products for skin-sensitive women. Among the lineup is the True Radiance All-Over Matte Oil, powered by Oil-Soluble Vitamin C, PhytoOmega, and Lycopene. These clean, skin-loving ingredients work together to brighten and even out skin tone, strengthen the skin barrier, and protect against UV damage. In a tropical country like ours, heat and humidity are constant skin challenges, and excess oil and sweat don’t just make makeup melt; when mixed with dirt and grease from the environment, they can also trigger breakouts. Dermatologists often recommend matte-based sunscreens for oily skin, and Hello Glow Ultralight++ Matte Sunscreen is also a recommended pick. Launched in February 2020 under Ever Bilena Cosmetics as part of a new skincare line, Hello Glow has quickly gained attention for being practical and budget-friendly for students. The Ultralight++ Matte Sunscreen fits into a daily routine: just apply it after cleansing and before makeup. Its main features include delivering broad UV protection to shield skin from harmful rays while leaving a matte finish that absorbs excess oil. Enriched with niacinamide, it also helps regulate skin oil production and gradually fade dark spots and pimple marks. When it comes to makeup, having it stay on for hours is essential, especially during school days without breaks. A reliable setting spray is what a student needs; only minor touch-ups are needed. Cagayan De Oro-based brand Chu Chu Beauty recently launched its first setting spray, designed to keep makeup in place for up to 16 hours. More than just a finishing mist, it also nourishes the skin with hydrating and antioxidant benefits. The formula feels lightweight, almost like bare skin, while leaving a soft matte finish that controls sweat and shine. Chuchu Beauty also came out with a Velvet Blur Mousse — a soft-matte, lightweight lipstick with a blurred finish. Matching with its Butter Bounce multipurpose cream-to-air blush, which provides a naturally flushed cheek color and lip tint. It comes in five blendable shades, from pinkish tones to mocha hues. The mocha is great for morena skin or a slightly toasted makeup look. Finding products that suit one’s skin type can be challenging, especially for those with sensitive or reactive skin. Many young Filipinas look for gentle formulas that can adapt to our tropical climate. New Filipino brand Pina Beauty’s Timeless Beauty Soap is designed to restore hydration, with its key ingredient, watermelon fruit extract, prized for its antioxidant and moisturizing properties to maintain even-toned skin throughout the day. The brand’s soap lineup addresses other skincare needs, from brightening (Pina Beauty Light) to acne-fighting benefits (Pina Beauty Glow). Pina Beauty’s journey goes beyond skincare — CEO Pamela Mejia shared that the brand’s evolution is rooted in a vision to create products that not only promote natural beauty but also embody cultural pride. This vision is reflected in its new packaging, inspired by traditional Filipino indigenous weaving patterns like Binakol, Hablon, and Yakan. Keeping our hands clean is one of the simplest ways to protect our health. But for students, our hands are constantly exposed to germs. From typing on keyboards, exchanging fare, holding doors, and more, that’s why many Filipinos have a handy bottle of alcohol at the ready. Understanding the daily hustle of busy women, Ana Jay Opeña — a Filipino mother and entrepreneur — created Mury, a luxurious, skin-caring, moisturizing hand alcohol infused with warm notes of vanilla and blood orange. The set comes in elegant, refillable bottles adorned with chic chains and personalized name stickers, making it easy and stylish to latch onto bags or pouches. And as students, makeup moods change as often as our schedules do. Some days call for a no-makeup makeup look, while others demand bold glam for big events. Sometimes it’s a soft neutral for a regular school day, or a deep red nude for an interview. Entrepreneur Nina Ellaine Dizon-Cabrera’s brand Colourette, founded in 2015, provides all shades. The brand released its new Jelly Kiss lip set this year — an ultra-hydrating, transfer-resistant lip stain that feels lightweight yet lasts all day. Available in eight shades, it offers options that flatter every skin tone (including morena beauties), making it versatile. The colors leave a natural stain on the lips for a no-makeup makeup look that students tend to gravitate towards. Whether we’re out in the field or studying in school, the constant switch between temperatures takes a toll on students’ hair. All that exposure can leave it dull, dry, and prone to damage. And on days when schedules get too tight, we sometimes skip the extra brushing or blow-drying, often ending up with hair that feels frizzy and rough. Aside from choosing the right shampoo and conditioner, paired with regular brushing, a good hair serum can be key to hair health. Mise en Scène’s Perfect Serum is the brand’s original and leading product. It contains seven nourishing oils, including argan, coconut, olive, and jojoba seed oil, all working together to protect, moisturize, and add shine and nutrients to your hair. Originally a Korean brand under Amorepacific, Mise en Scène entered the Philippine market in 2018 and is available both online and in stores. It is best to apply the serum after towel-drying your hair to lock in moisture for the whole school day. Taking good care of your body goes beyond skincare and nutrition — it also includes the foundation of every outfit: your innerwear. The right foundation garment can change how you carry yourself and boost your confidence throughout the day. Maidenform’s Seamless Foam Wireless Bra is meant to be stylish, lightweight and comfortable. It combines simplicity and sophistication with a subtle allure, featuring lightly lined, soft foam cups that provide natural shaping and just the right amount of lift. The global brand also carries shapewear, underwear, body suits, and lace bralettes. – Steph Arnaldo and Trixia Policarpio/Rappler.com Trixia Policarpio is a Rappler intern studying BA Creative Writing at University of the Philippines Diliman.",True,true,For the ‘glow-getters’: What should be in a busy student’s self-care starter kit?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/busy-woman-self-care-starter-kit-beauty-brands/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Chinese smugglers, Philippine government officials and employees, and local businessmen are “in connivance” to bring in millions worth of misdeclared agricultural goods in the country, Senator Francis “Kiko” Pangilinan said on Monday, October 20. Pangilinan, head of the Senate committee on agriculture, food, and agrarian reform, has been leading an investigation into smuggling and prices of food commodities, such as imported rice and fish. Officials and employees from the Bureau of Customs, National Bureau of Investigation, Philippine National Police, Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Justice, and the Bureau of Immigration “allow these Chinese smugglers and their local partners to operate freely,” Pangilinan said during a Senate hearing on Monday. “Unti-unting nabubunyag ang bulok na sistema kung saan mga dummy consignee at insiders nagsasabwatan kasama ang ilang mga opisyal ng Customs, at posible rin taga-DA,” said Pangilinan. (Slowly the rotten system is being exposed, where there are dummy consignees and insiders colluding with officials from Customs and possibly even from the Department of Agriculture.) The government had seized containers of misdeclared goods coming from China. The products smuggled in and eventually seized by the government were white and red onions and frozen mackerel. Pangilinan said these seizures were only done “to show a semblance of law enforcement while ensuring that no big-time smuggler is prosecuted for the non-bailable offense of economic sabotage.” Smuggling is one of the crimes considered as “economic sabotage” under the Anti-Agricultural Economic Sabotage Act, which President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed in September 2024. During Monday’s hearing, Pangilinan identified the following Chinese exporters who smuggle misdeclared goods into the Philippines: Last July, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said they intend to conduct risk assessment of shipments coming from China. It was on the same day that the Bureau of Customs seized containers of smuggled onions and frozen mackerel from China declared as mantou, egg noodles, and kimchi. According to Tiu Laurel in September, the DA had led 182 anti-smuggling operations between January 2024 and July 2025. This resulted in the seizure of P3.78 billion worth of illegal agricultural and fishery goods, the statement from DA said. The agriculture department does not have enforcement authority and has only been able to blacklist several agricultural importers so far. Misdeclaring agricultural products as food products help exporters and consignees evade more stringent regulations. – Rappler.com",True,true,Chinese smugglers ‘operate freely’ with help of PH gov’t officials — Pangilinan,https://www.rappler.com/business/chinese-smugglers-operate-freely-help-government-officials-philippines-pangilinan/,Rappler
"TOKYO, Japan – Japanese restaurants, bars and stores are running low on beer and other beverages from industry leader Asahi Group as the impact from a cyberattack entered a fifth day on Friday, October 3, with no resolution in sight. Known for its Super Dry beer, Nikka Whisky, as well as non-alcoholic beverages, Asahi suspended operations in Japan on Monday including order processing, shipping and call center functions after a cyberattack caused a system outage. The company began processing orders for some products on Wednesday by visiting customers in person and handwriting orders, it said. While it continues to take orders for food and soft drinks, it has not taken further orders for alcoholic beverages to prioritize outgoing shipments, which began on Friday for the first batch of manually filled orders, it said. Asahi said it continues to work with investigative authorities on the cyberattack. On Friday in Tokyo, one eatery that normally only serves Asahi-branded beer said it was on its last keg of Asahi Super Dry, and that its supplier brought beer from rival Sapporo a day earlier, citing the shortage. “It’s a bit of a problem,” said Tomiko Yano, a chef at restaurant Kushiyaki Tosaka. “We specialize in yakitori (skewered chicken) and it pairs really well with Super Dry. A lot of customers say that, so I’m a little worried (about the shortage).” Convenience store operator Lawson said it was expecting a shortage of Asahi products soon and it was making preparations to sell alternative products. FamilyMart and 7-Eleven also said they were affected. – Rappler.com",True,true,Tapped out: Asahi beers running dry in Japan as cyberattack shutdown lingers,https://www.rappler.com/business/asahi-beers-shortage-japan-cyberattack-causes-shutdown/,Rappler
"Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer: It is my first time to enter into a romantic relationship. I am quite happy with that fact. We have been together for three years. I have successfully introduced my girlfriend to my family and friends. My world and hers are well integrated. My girlfriend is independent and assertive. I thought this was okay. She tells me what she wants. She communicates well. It turns out this brand of assertiveness means speaking her mind with no filters. She’s not concerned if she sounds offensive. She doesn’t respect me. I don’t receive words of affirmation. Instead, I get criticized and mocked. She announces that she’s doing all the planning for us, complaining I never plan out dates. She compares and criticizes me to other couples — mainly bloggers and influencers on social media. She also chastizes me for my lack of familiarity of my kitchen’s organization, even for my dog’s fear of thunder! She also behaves this way in front of my family, my friends, and her friends who she always compares me to. I am not what she says I am. When I confront her about her behavior and claims, she responds with deflection. Examples of this include: “Totoo naman wala kang ginagawa e It’s true you’re not doing anything)!” Sometimes she makes excuses like “Sorry! I have goldfish memory talaga(really)!” or “Sorry, it’s hard for me to change that, being so used to my harsh upbringing.” Basically more gaslighting, no accountability, zero filter and zero patience. It doesn’t feel like there is any initiative to change her behavior. “Why would that be my fault?!!?” she claims. She’s throwing hints of marriage lately but we’re not emotionally there yet. The relationship is still too “shaky”/unstable for me. I’m not confident moving to that next chapter. Like all the pieces aren’t welding together true. Where did we go wrong? Am I at a loss here? Do I lack a specific set of skills to have a smoother relationship with her? Am I adding more to her “mental load” or am I being micromanaged and criticized and disrespected? I don’t want to lead her on, but I honestly don’t know if there’s anything left to save. Thank you very much for your time, Kevin Dear Kevin, As this is your first relationship, allowances should be made but there are limits. You have been going out for three years with someone who, according to you, doesn’t respect you, doesn’t give words of affirmation, criticizes and mocks you in public, gaslights you, has zero filter and zero patience, and finally doesn’t take responsibility for her words and actions. This seems to be a relationship that you are pursuing for the sake of having a relationship, whatever the quality. Instead, perhaps you need to ask yourself: in view of all these negatives, is this a relationship you actually want to remain committed to? In fact you already hint that you know the answer because you are wary of the very idea of going to the next stage and wondering where it all went wrong. It is time to acknowledge all these red flags for what they are, accept that your girlfriend is not only not supportive but in reality undermining you at every turn, and since she won’t change you need to exit and move on. You deserve a relationship with someone who actually likes you. All the best, JAFBaer Dear Kevin: Thank you very much for your letter. I agree with Mr. Baer’s answer 100%! What I particularly like is when, in his second paragraph, he wrote: “…perhaps you need to ask yourself: in view of all these negatives, is this a relationship you actually want to remain committed to?“ I, too, want you to ask yourself some questions. This has nothing to do with your (hopefully) soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend (let’s call her Myra), but more to do with yourself: 1. your early trauma (if any), 2. your idea of a good relationship and where you got this idea from; 3. your fantasies of what a happy marriage consists of and, again, your basis for having such fantasies (and whether, deep down, you believe these fantasies to be realistic or not), and finally, your possible answer to the question: “What was going in inside/outside of you that allowed you to stay in this relationship this long?” Please do not feel I am blaming you (especially with that last question). There are many reasons people stay in relationships that are obviously unhealthy, the most glaring (and, surprisingly, quite common) reason being that many people are unaware that their relationship is so unhealthy, too one-sided, and so damaging to one’s self esteem. Some convince themselves that relationships are really difficult and require a lot of work. On the one hand, that is true. On the other hand, however, they shouldn’t be THAT difficult! And if there is hardly any laughter or validation of self within that relationship, then, TSUGI (canceled, fired, removed, out)! The people who believe that, because relationships are hard, sacrifices have to be made (like being embarrassed in public, constantly being criticized) usually get this idea from past experience/s. Not necessarily directly from your own previous experience, but most likely via observation — maybe from how your mother and father interacted, or what is most common among your friends’ parents. Thus, because such a belief is so deeply ingrained, many people are unaware that this sort of relationship is emotional abuse. Generally, more women than men suffer from this kind of interaction (with people, with their own culture) but men do too and I am glad this is an opportunity to bring this issue out in the open. Dearest Kevin, remember that reading this is primarily a cognitive exercise for you. For a realization to really make an impact and make a difference in what you can comfortably say no to, usually more than a change in cognition is necessary. BUT, this is the first step. Please, please tell us if there is anything else we can do for you, dearest Kev. All the best, MG Holmes – Rappler.com",True,true,[Two Pronged] My girlfriend often criticizes and mocks me.

"As the Philippines enters the new year, it carries two heavy but inseparable ledgers: one economic and one political. Both were written painstakingly over the past 12 months, line by line, decision by decision — sometimes with discipline, often with hesitation, and occasionally with costly contradiction. For investors, citizens, and policymakers alike, the question is no longer whether the country has momentum because it does. The more urgent question is whether it has coherence. Year 2025 was not a collapse year, but it was also not the breakout year many had hoped for. Economic growth remained respectable by regional standards, yet stubbornly below the country’s full potential. Inflation, while easing from its post-pandemic and commodity-shock peaks, left scars on household balance sheets. Interest rates stayed elevated long enough to cool credit appetite and test highly-leveraged corporate structures. The peso found moments of stability, but never fully escaped the gravitational pull of global dollar strength and persistent trade gaps. Still, resilience was unmistakable. Consumption — long the Philippine economy’s most reliable engine — proved difficult to kill, even as food prices pinched and borrowing costs rose. Remittances continued to act as a quiet stabilizer, cushioning external shocks and propping up domestic demand. Infrastructure spending, though unevenly executed, kept the long-term growth narrative intact, reminding markets that concrete, steel, and logistics still matter in a country of more than 110 million people. Yet beneath the headline numbers lay a more uncomfortable truth: growth increasingly felt defended rather than accelerated. Too much of the year was spent managing rather than decisively neutralizing risks that were already visible: supply-side inflation, governance concerns, and regulatory uncertainty, to name a few. Economic policy often sounded right, but moved cautiously. Markets listened, but waited. Politically, the year was defined by an uneasy calm. The administration projected stability, continuity, and pragmatism — qualities investors generally welcome. But stability without urgency carries its own cost. Governance reforms advanced in rhetoric more than in execution. Anti-corruption drives surfaced in waves — sometimes forceful, sometimes selective, often reactive. The result was a political environment that avoided chaos, but fell short of conviction. This ambiguity mattered. Capital is patient only to a point. Foreign investors, already skittish about emerging markets amid global tightening cycles, looked for clearer signals: faster regulatory decisions, stronger institutional accountability, and a sharper break from legacy practices that blur the line between political power and economic privilege. Too often, those signals arrived late or not at all. What the past year ultimately revealed is that the Philippine story is no longer about raw potential. That debate has been settled for decades. It is now about execution risk. Investors are not asking whether the country can grow at 6% or 7% again. They are asking whether the institutions governing that growth are strong enough to make it durable, inclusive, and credible. As the new year opens, the economic outlook offers both relief and challenge. Inflation is easing, giving the Central Bank room to maneuver. Rate cuts, once hypothetical, are now plausible. This could revive credit, lift investment sentiment, and offer breathing space to overextended balance sheets — from households to conglomerates. But easier money will only magnify existing structures. If capital flows into productive investment, the payoff could be substantial. If it merely reflates asset prices or masks inefficiencies, the opportunity will be squandered. Fiscal policy faces a similar fork in the road. Debt levels remain manageable, but no longer trivial. Every peso spent now carries a higher burden of justification. Infrastructure must deliver returns, not just ribbon-cuttings. Social spending must translate into measurable outcomes, not permanent dependency. The margin for populist miscalculation has narrowed. Politically, the coming year will test whether stability can evolve into reform. Midterm dynamics are already shaping incentives. History suggests this is when difficult decisions are postponed, compromises multiply, and accountability thins. But history is not destiny. A credible push on governance — real transparency in public-private partnerships, consistent enforcement of market rules, and visible consequences for abuse — could fundamentally reset investor perception. The Philippines today sits at a familiar crossroads, but with less room for error than in past cycles. Demographics remain favorable, the consumer base is large, and strategic geography still matters in a fragmenting global economy. These are strengths many countries envy. Yet they no longer guarantee patience from markets or forgiveness from citizens. The past year was a reminder that resilience is not the same as progress. The year ahead will determine whether the country merely absorbs shocks — or finally converts stability into sustained, higher-quality growth. For the Philippines, the choice is clear, even if the path is not: reform decisively and earn a re-rating, or drift cautiously and accept mediocrity dressed as resilience. As we step into a new year, the country carries an economic ledger much larger — and more complex — than the simple growth figures that once defined its narrative. Investors, policymakers and global partners are asking the same question: Is the economy ready to transcend cyclical resilience and embrace transformative expansion? The answer today, as culled by Vantage Point, in fresh data from international institutions and local authorities, is a qualified “yes” — but with caveats that aren’t going away. Economically, the Philippines remains one of Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing markets, yet growth is decelerating from the heady post-pandemic rebound. Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 5.5% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025, outpacing many regional peers. Yet, as the year progressed, momentum softened. Multiple forecasts — from regional bodies to local authorities and private economists — now place full-year GDP growth closer to 5.2-5.3%. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank paint similar pictures: growth remains above 5% and competitive globally, but below earlier targets and pre-pandemic trajectories. Notably, the Department of Finance (DOF) itself has acknowledged that 2025 growth may settle nearer to 4.7-4.8%, well under the official 5.5-6.5% goal. Meanwhile, gross national product (GNP) — which includes net income from abroad — has climbed to historic highs in absolute terms, touching over ₱6.68 trillion in the third quarter of 2025. This suggests that income earned by Filipinos overseas and returns from foreign investment remain structural strengths. Inflation presents a nuanced victory. Consumer price inflation slipped to around 1.5% in late 2025, comfortably below the Central Bank’s 2-4% target range.This benign price environment has afforded the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) the flexibility to cut policy rates repeatedly to spur credit and investment — a notable shift from the tight monetary stances of the pandemic era. But low inflation also reflects weaker demand in investment and external sectors, not simply price stability. That’s the precise challenge facing Philippine policymakers: avoid deflationary complacency, while nurturing deeper private sector investment beyond consumption spending. Macroeconomic indicators alone don’t tell the whole story. Investors are increasingly sensitive to political undercurrents that could reshape growth trajectories. International benchmarks such as Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index continue to place the Philippines in a challenging light, with a score of 33 out of 100 and a rank around 114th of 180 countries. While this represents a slight improvement over prior years, it remains below regional and global averages, suggesting persistent governance gaps. Domestically, these perceptions have translated into visible political unrest. In 2025, mass protests erupted nationwide in response to a sprawling corruption scandal involving flood control and infrastructure funds — one of the largest civic mobilizations in years. Subsequent criminal charges have ensnared dozens of political and business figures, including high-level legislators, underscoring both the depth of the problem and the political will to pursue accountability, however unevenly. At the same time, recent surveys from the Philippine Observatory on Democracy indicate rising public concern over corruption, disinformation and civic disengagement — signals that democratic legitimacy may be as consequential an economic variable as tax policy or tariff rates. Externally, the national economy is vulnerable to trends well beyond its borders. Efforts to diversify exports face headwinds from shifting US trade policy and global tariff regimes which, analysts say, could dampen export competitiveness and investment flows in 2026. Compared with its peers in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Philippines sits in a mid-tier competitive band — beating some neighbors, but still trailing the likes of Indonesia and Vietnam in composite influence measures that weigh economic strength, diplomacy, and technological capacity. So where does this leave the country in the year ahead? On the economic front, the Philippines has the fundamentals — the demographic dividend, robust remittances, resilient consumption — to sustain growth. But converting these advantages into higher, sustained investment and productivity gains will require sharper policy execution, deeper structural reform, and more attractive conditions for long-horizon investors. On the political front, the unfolding drama around governance and corruption could be a tipping point. Clean, transparent institutions aren’t just moral imperatives — they are economic multipliers that unlock investor confidence, reduce risk premia, and widen the tax base. The Philippines’ growth story is far from finished; it has merely entered a new chapter — one in which policy coherence, not just headline figures, will define the country’s place on the global economic stage. If the next year is about choices, then the most consequential one is this: Will the Philippines reinforce its growth foundations with credible governance, or will political ambiguity undermine its economic promise? Quo Vadis, Philippines? Markets are watching, and increasingly so its own citizens. – Rappler.com Click here for more Vantage Point articles.",True,true,"[Vantage Point] A year of reckoning: Which way, Philippines?",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-year-of-reckoning-which-way-philippines/,Rappler
"The Marcos administration on Tuesday, November 18, announced a “win for Philippine agriculture” and exports after US President Donald Trump signed a new executive order (EO) last week essentially reversing (though not fully) his reciprocal tariffs policy first announced in April 2025, meant to revitalize the US economy. In the case of the Philippines, it was initially 17% and then 20% tariffs slapped on Philippine goods, later reduced to 19%. (READ Vantage Point: Can the Philippines endure economic pain with Trump’s tariff?) According to the Palace, the new EO now allows more than $1 billion worth of mostly agricultural products of the Philippines — accounting for nearly half of the country’s US$14.5 billion exports to the US — to enter America duty free effective immediately. These include its major agricultural exports to the US — various coconut products and byproducts (e.g. dessicated coconuts, crude coconut oil, coconut water), mangoes, bananas, processed pineapples — which had faced a higher tariff rate, making them more costly to American consumers. One Philippine senior trade official attributed the policy reversal of Trump to the Philippines’ “patience” in dealing with the US, after many critics laughed at why other ASEAN countries, not even treaty allies, supposedly got better deals than the Philippines. Recall that last July, when President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. went to the US to meet with Trump, they agreed to bring down the tariff on Philippine goods from 20% to 19%, a 1-point reduction panned by many. At that time, Trump described Marcos as a “very tough negotiator…,” adding that “he loves your country.“ But what’s the more important — and perhaps underlying reason — why Trump signed his new EO? The policy reversal, dated November 14, came 10 days after Democrats won three local races — in New York City, Virginia, and New Jersey. Reuters news agency described the losses as a “barometer of how Americans are responding to Trump’s tumultuous nine months in office.” More importantly, the policy reversal comes in light of higher prices of select goods where Trump’s reciprocal tariffs have kicked in — and Americans feeling the impact on their pockets. CNN, for instance, cites the case of bananas, imported mostly from South America. Americans are paying 8% more for their bananas, the news outfit reports. Other reports cite higher prices for what many Americans love: steak. Which is why a number of American media outfits have linked the new Trump EO to US domestic politics and economy. “Trump scraps tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruit in a push to lower prices,” says the NPR or National Public Radio. “From McDonalds to Mortgages, Trump tries to reclaim affordability,” writes TIME Magazine. “Trump administration prepares tariff exemptions in bid to lower food prices,” reports the New York Times. Take note that in that EO, “Modifying the scope of the reciprocal tariff with respect to certain agricultural products,” and in the White House’s fact sheet about it, the Philippines isn’t even specifically mentioned since the unilateral policy reversal applies to many countries that export food to the US. In the White House’s fact sheet on the new EO, it talked about Trump’s trade deals with Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The White House says these agricultural products that now have zero tariffs are “not grown in sufficient quantities in the US.” It says: “The President has thus determined that certain agricultural products shall no longer be subject to the reciprocal tariffs. Some of these products include: So, the underlying reason behind the Trump policy reversal is essentially domestic. And many have included this new EO as part of the US president’s “TACO,” a new acronym that takes a dig at Trump’s supposed decision-making process: Trump Always Chickens Out. CNN, in its November 15 article on the policy reversal, says, “The latest TACO comes after voters, worried about affordability, gave Republicans a drubbing in recent off-year elections.” Philippine officials now say they’ll be working on other items that are still covered by the 19% reciprocal tariffs such as garments, textiles, furniture, automotive products, etc. Hopefully, these will also be included in Trump’s TACO. – Rappler.com",True,true,TACO: Why Trump walked back on 19% reciprocal tariff on Philippine agriculture,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/taco-donald-trump-reversed-reciprocal-tarriffs-philippine-agriculture/,Rappler

"SYDNEY, Australia – Australia’s Qantas Airways said on Sunday, October 12, that it was one of the companies whose customer data had been published by cybercriminals after it was stolen by a hacker in a July breach of a database containing the personal information of the airline’s customers. The airline said in July that more than a million customers had sensitive details such as phone numbers, birth dates or home addresses accessed in one of Australia’s biggest cyber breaches in years. Another four million customers had just their name and email address taken during the hack, it said at the time. The July breach represented Australia’s most high-profile cyberattack since telecommunications giant Optus and health insurer Medibank were hit in 2022, incidents that prompted mandatory cyber resilience laws. On Sunday, Qantas said in a statement that it was “one of a number of companies globally that has had data released by cyber criminals following the airline’s cyber incident in early July, where customer data was stolen via a third party platform”. “With the help of specialist cyber security experts, we are investigating what data was part of the release,” it said. “We have an ongoing injunction in place to prevent the stolen data being accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published by anyone, including third parties,” the airline added. Hacker collective Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters is behind the Qantas data release, which occurred after a ransom deadline set by the group passed, the Guardian Australia news site reported.

"The Philippines has earned the unenviable — and embarrassing — title of “the country with the fastest rising rates of HIV in Asia and the Pacific.” While the region overall has experienced a 13% drop in the number of cases since 2010, the Philippines has reported a 550% increase between 2010 and 2024, prompting the DOH to push for declaring HIV a public health emergency. This is not an overnight development — the epidemic has been simmering for decades, having transitioned from “low and slow” in the early 2000s to “fast and furious” in the past two decades, with no signs of slowing down. The latest DOH HIV quarterly report, covering April-June 2025, confirms once again the upward trajectory of HIV in the country: 5,000 new cases were recorded — an average of 56 new cases per day are being diagnosed, or one every 25 minutes. In 2010, approximately six new cases per day were reported. Even if we have fewer cases in total compared to countries like Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, these countries have managed to rein in their new cases, with rates dropping overall. Back in 2018, HIV surveillance findings in so-called “key populations,” showed that between 4% to 6% of all young men having sex with men (MSM), and transgender — with a sample of over 4,000 respondents — tested positive for HIV. That’s about one in 20. People who injected drugs, measured in “hot spots” in Cebu, had very high HIV prevalence — 29%, (roughly over one person in four) in 2015. But why declare it a public health emergency only now? I believe this is due to a drying up of funding for HIV (and for general development assistance) from the US Government. The decapitation of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration, to the “sun setting” (rather facetious term for closure) of the Joint United Nations Program on AIDS (UNAIDS) has led to major shortfalls in an already underfunded global HIV response. This ultimately affects other programs such as PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, to the GFATM (Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria). All these agencies have been strong supporters of the HIV responses in the Philippines for decades now. The Philippine government has gradually taken on a larger share of funding for HIV, particularly with regards to medications, and domestic resources are now the major source of funding. However, most of the critical strategies and innovative responses, particularly those related to advocacy and working with CSOs, “key” populations such as drug users, sex workers, MSM and transgender people, are funded through international donors. Understandably, government staff and clinics are less able to reach these — and during the drug war, many simply became unreachable. There are specific ways of HIV transmission: unprotected sexual intercourse with someone who is able to transmit; sharing of unclean needles and injecting equipment, through transfusion of infected blood products, from a pregnant HIV positive mother to her unborn child, or during breastfeeding. Virtually all transmission through the blood, needles, pregnancy and breastfeeding routes have been practically eliminated — by effective screening of blood, during pregnancy, through prophylaxis, and ensuring that needles and injecting equipment are sterile, single-use, and sharing eliminated. Both HIV and Hepatitis B are transmitted in identical ways, but a vaccine for Hep B is available, and none so far for HIV. In the Philippines, 90% to 95% of all reported cases of HIV are due to sexual transmission; in some areas in Cebu, sharing of unclean needles by people who inject drugs is a significant route. Around 85% to 90% of all the new cases are among young men and trans women who report sexual contact with other men or trans. One possible reason for rapid spread is the variant of HIV that is causing infection. Studies by Salvaña et al show that a particular HIV strain, (CRFo1AE) was seen in over 70% of all newly diagnosed cases of HIV between 2016-2018. This subtype was associated with higher viral loads, lower CD 4 counts on diagnosis, and faster progression to AIDS. It may also be a more “aggressive” subtype. Currently there are an estimated 250,000 people with HIV in the Philippines, of which only approximately 57% know their HIV status. In Iloilo province, the percentage of those who know their HIV positive status is even lower — 45%, according to the Provincial Health Office. Of the 57%, just two thirds (66%) are on life-saving Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART). Of those on ART, 47% have viral suppression — or levels of the virus that are so low that HIV transmission is no longer a possibility. Late reporting and limited availability of testing for viral load may explain this low reported rate, as the drugs are very effective and generally viral suppression rates are over 95%. The country is thus very unlikely to reach the “95-95-95” targets for HIV, which will lead to elimination of HIV as a public health threat by 2030. The first 95 refers to the % of people with HIV who know their status; the second 95 refers to the % of people with HIV who are on ART; and the last 95 refers to the % of people on ART with viral suppression. Philippine figures, as of 2025, are merely 57-66-47. The pace of putting people on life-saving treatment cannot keep up with the pace of new infections being diagnosed each month. Meanwhile, of those newly diagnosed, 25% are in an advanced stage of HIV disease — meaning, they have acquired HIV years ago, the immune system has deteriorated, with opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis and pneumocystis. CD 4 counts are very low and viral loads high. Late diagnosis and treatment means more complications, longer times for recovery, more misery, and higher death rates. In the country, 22% or 1 in 5 people on ART has been “lost to follow up,” a rate that should also be cause for alarm. Many who start treatment do not continue, or they drop out. Inadequate treatment leads to drug resistance and treatment failures. Young peoples’ levels of knowledge about HIV have been declining over the years, as reported from the 2021 Young Adult Fertility Surveys (YAFS). AIDS awareness declined from 95% in 1994 and 2002, to 83% in 2013, and 76% in 2021. In 2021, 70% of respondents think they have no chance of getting HIV, a mere 15% know a place for HIV testing, and only 19% of the youth have comprehensive knowledge of HIV prevention and transmission. We must remember that every year, a new cohort of young people become sexually active, and lack the right information about HIV, and how to prevent it. All the prevention messages bear repeating year after year. Not engaging in penetrative sex (i.e., vaginal or anal) reduces risk. Oral sex, sex with condoms and many forms of masturbation are considered low-risk, compared to unprotected (i.e., condom-less, or “bareback”) sex. However, one does not indulge in a single sexual practice during an encounter. It can start with kissing, foreplay, other forms of stimulation leading to oral, vaginal and/or anal intercourse, and may culminate in an orgasm. But even if people do know about safer sex, it is always not easy to say “no,” particularly if one is in the throes of emotions, or conflicted, or excited to try out new things and experiences. There may also be a sense of denial, coupled with rationalizations — “I won’t get infected,” “he is so healthy looking, he could not possibly have HIV,” ”I won’t let him ejaculate in me,” “condoms reduce pleasure,” “it’s only one person that I’ve had sex with,” or ”I did it only once naman,” etc. Complicating the mix are sex parties, having numerous sexual partners, the concurrent use of alcohol, stimulants, and “chemsex” — when under the influences of such substances, one may completely forget protection, or may be too incapacitated to resist or say “no.” As one young yuppie put it, “it is difficult to control carnal desires” and so in the heat of sexual attraction, defenses crumble. The fact is that Pinoys, of all genders, sexual orientations, religions and regions, are having sex, and bearing children. In the 2021 YAFS, 28% of male youth and 16% of females reported having sex before marriage. One in five young women between 15-24 has already had a child, or is currently pregnant. A third of these pregnancies are unwanted — despite all the admonitions about early pregnancy, or not having premarital sex. For someone sexually active now, the traditional “ABCD” messages — Abstain-Be Faithful-Condoms-Don’t inject drugs/share needles — from the ’80s and ’90s are supplemented by other methods. PrEP (Pre-exposure prophylaxis), and self-testing for HIV (tests for HIV are available at drug stores, much like the pregnancy test kits). Condoms, used consistently, properly, and with the right type of lubricants, protect against other sexually transmitted infections (STI) and pregnancy. There are ways of negotiating safer sex practices that reduce the risks of HIV. The slogan “U=U” (Undetectable=Untransmittable) means that a person with adequate treatment whose viral load is undetectable, is, for all practical purposes, no longer able to infect other people. This has enabled discordant partners (one HIV positive and the other HIV negative) to have a fulfilling sexual relationship, and have children, without the fear of possible transmission. Accessibility of the prevention and treatment tools for ALL youth — including those in and out of school, those in prison or in rehab, with sensory and learning difficulties — need to be available. There are young people who are deaf, or have disabilities, and they are also having sexual lives; some may even be subjects of abuse and sexual exploitation. There is virtually no information on HIV for those with hearing disabilities, or with little comprehension of English or Tagalog. There are but a few groups that provide sexual health education for those who cannot hear, see, or who have physical and learning disabilities. Information is not available in different local languages, including braille and sign language, and there are very few trained interpreters. There are physical barriers to access, especially for people who may have mobility issues. Companions are needed when services are being accessed; transportation costs are higher for those with disabilities. Health workers express surprise and even disapproval at youth who are sexually active and not married, and may not be prepared to discuss sex and reproduction with those who have disabilities. The number of facilities offering ART treatment in Panay has increased. Apart from the West Visayas Medical Center (WVMC), there are now 20 HIV treatment hubs and outpatient HIV facilities in Panay, compared to six in 2021. San Jose de Buenavista and Culasi in Antique; Aklan has Boracay, Kalibo, New Washington while Capiz province has Roxas City and Dao. Iloilo has the most: Alimodian, Cabatuan, Calinog, Guimbal, Concepcion, Barotac Nuevo, Balasan, Janiuay, and Pototan. In Iloilo City, treatment hubs are in St. Paul’s Hospital, The Medical City, WVSU Medical Center and the FPOP (Family Planning Organization of the Philippines). People have a choice where they can seek treatment. Many do not wish to receive treatment in their own hometowns for fear of discovery. Some may be having treatment with private practitioners and in other countries. A listing of 300 treatment hubs and primary HIV care facilities nationwide is available from the DOH and the PIA website. ART continues to be free of charge. Stigma and discrimination are major barriers to access. Stigma comes from the perception of HIV as a terminal illness (which it no longer is), contagious (which it is not) and association with people who are considered immoral, deviant, someone who is looked down on and ridiculed — a relic from the years when the then unknown, wasting illness was linked to the 4 Hs — homosexuals, hemophiliacs, heroin users, and haitians. Stigma may be external or/and internalized. Discrimination that reduces a person’s access to information and services is the most damaging; they may be reluctant to go to clinics or join community activities. If there is much stigma about being queer or gay, or being HIV positive, and use of drugs considered illegal, people are unlikely to come forward, get tested for HIV, and will hide or deny their status. They may not want to be seen in a facility that is frequented by people with HIV. Mandatory HIV testing is prohibited by law, but is still practiced. NGOs, CSOs and various community groups are uniquely positioned to support counseling, testing and treatment for young persons who may be at risk for HIV. They have peer educators, innovative outreach services, drop-in centers, and various activities to engage the youth, which clinics are unable to provide. Some of the more prominent NGO-run clinics in the city include FPOP, which offers family planning, laboratory services and primary health care, ARV treatment and a transgender health service. Team Dugong Bughaw (TDB) has the “Yuhum” (Smile) Community Center. Both TDB and FPOP provide HIV screening and counseling, and PrEP. They have volunteers and facilitators whom young people can relate to, and run open, welcoming spaces where young people can feel more safe, confident and comfortable, enabling them to discuss concerns around sexual health and rights, including mental health issues. Contrast this with a room in a crowded hospital corridor, where most HIV treatment facilities can be found. Finally, while the country has an enabling policy on HIV education in schools (through RA 11166, the HIV and AIDS Policy Act) and for Sexual and Reproductive Health education in (mandated by the 2012 RH law), both remain unevenly resourced and implemented. In a study done in an unnamed Philippine city, Kim et al found that “local stakeholders have different concepts of Reproductive Health (RH) and delivered their own perceived concept of RH; teachers lack RH pedagogy and training while they also tend to minimize and modify their teaching in fear of further stimulating student interest in sex.” The RH law, though over a decade old, continues to be controversial and is perceived to be in conflict with Filipino social and cultural norms. In a Department of Education order in September 2025, “Policy on the Implementation of Reproductive Health Education for Adolescent learners in Basic Education,” Secretary Sonny Angara directed the department to “integrate basic and age-appropriate instruction on the causes, modes of transmission and ways of preventing the spread of HIV and AIDS and other STIs into the curricula of public and private learning institutions, including alternative and indigenous learning systems, in accordance with the HIV and AIDS Policy Act.” More specific implementing guidelines need to be developed, though. So there are really quite complex reasons for our rising HIV rates — more testing means more cases, and better early detection and treatment, in the long run. Being ready to discuss sexuality, safer sexual behaviors, HIV prevention and transmission openly and in a non-judgmental way, reducing stigma, doing outreach, increasing condom use and PrEP, and strengthening reproductive health education for youth — in and out of school, could help in blunting the rise of HIV in the country. We need more open discussions with young people, especially young LGBTQ, to find out what they’re thinking, and what might be acceptable and effective interventions to reduce risk. We also need to work closely with non-government organizations, youth organizations, organizations working on sexual and reproductive health and rights. We need innovative ways of reaching young people who may be at extra risk for early sexual activity. How do we make sure they see the prevention messages, recall and practice them, seek out services, and know their HIV status? How do we ensure they are comfortable going to clinics, meeting with health workers, peer educators/counselors, doing telehealth? How do we support people with HIV so that they continue to receive treatment, and not drop off the radar? This is one public health emergency that will be here for decades to come. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Ilonggo Notes] Why do young Filipinos continue to test positive for HIV?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/why-young-filipinos-test-positive-hiv/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – If there’s one thing everybody experiences, it’s stress. Defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), stress is “a state of worry or mental tension caused by a difficult situation.” Stress is a natural human response that can be helpful to a degree, pushing us to act on challenges or respond to life’s circumstances. However, too much stress can be detrimental to both our mind and body, leading to physical and mental health problems in the future. For World Mental Health Month, the results of a Social Weather Station (SWS) survey highlights how stress has been impacting Filipinos in their daily life. Amid today’s tumultuous political and economic landscape, how are Filipinos faring psychologically and mentally? According to a SWS survey conducted from September 24 to 30, and released on October 10 for World Mental Health Day, 34% of Filipinos say they feel stressed “frequently” in daily life. There were 1,500 respondents for the survey, Filipino adults aged 18 and above nationwide. This is a significant increase from December 2019, when only 27% reported frequent stress, indicating an upward trend. In September 2025, 32% said they experience stress sometimes, 30% rarely, and 4% never. Compared to the December 2019 survey, those experiencing stress sometimes fell by 5 points (from 37%), and those who rarely experience it dropped by four points (from 34%). Those who “never” experience stress remained almost the same (from 2% to 4%). Various factors can contribute to stress, but for the majority of Filipinos (53%), the biggest factor is one’s financial situation, according to the SWS survey. It’s no surprise, since inflation in the country has been rising again — in September, it went up 1.7%, up from 1.5 % in August, amid higher fuel and vegetable prices. Other major stressors of Filipinos include one’s health (42%), followed by one’s school or job performance (39%), and one’s family situation (38%). The SWS survey said that these numbers offer “valuable insight into how different pressures affect daily life and overall mental well-being.” Trying to handle stress on our own may become too daunting a task, so mental health professionals advise looking out for warning signs that you or a loved one may need professional guidance or support. The Third Quarter 2025 Social Weather Survey was conducted from samples of 300 respondents from Metro Manila, 600 from Luzon (areas outside the capital), and 300 each from the Visayas and Mindanao. The survey results have a ±3% margin of error for national figures, ±4% for Luzon, and ±6% for Metro Manila, the Visayas, and Mindanao, according to SWS. “The area estimates were weighted by the Philippine Statistics Authority medium-population projections for 2025 to obtain the national estimates,” SWS added. They also said that the survey was non-commissioned or conducted on SWS’ own initiative and released as a public service. – Rappler.com",True,true,What’s stressing out most Filipinos these days?

"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia – Cristiano Ronaldo. Naomi Campbell. Sofia Vergara. And the latest celebrity brought to Saudi Arabia in the kingdom’s push to become a global entertainment destination: MrBeast, the most popular YouTuber on the planet. The online sensation hit 100 billion views this month and is in Riyadh to launch Beast Land, a theme park modeled on his videos that put people through elaborate endurance challenges to win large cash prizes. “It’s probably one of the best days of my life,” the 27-year-old, whose real name is James Donaldson, told Reuters ahead of the launch on Thursday, in one of at least nine interviews conducted as part of his Saudi PR blitz. “One of the top requests I get is: I want to be in a MrBeast video… So now (we are) creating that in real life where you guys can come visit it and experience what it is like,” he said. Over the past decade, once ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia has rapidly developed entertainment options as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 to diversify the country away from oil and transform society. Young Saudis grew up with few avenues for fun, with cinemas and concerts effectively banned. Outsiders saw the kingdom as stuck in time. Both perceptions have shifted. The Saudi capital is now the scene of Riyadh Season, running almost half the year with near-daily events from boxing and slap contests to house music parties and sports competitions. Lit up in neon-blue, Beast Land combines theme park attractions like rollercoasters with Donaldson’s American Gladiator-style challenges, such as a game where the last player to slap a button when it lights up falls to cushioned doom. Donaldson says 70% of his fans are outside the US and Saudi Arabia was also a natural choice due to easily accessible studio space to film his latest season of videos. “I’d say give it a try, it’s much more developed than you’d think,” he said. The kingdom has been known to attract international talent with massive compensation: Cristiano Ronaldo’s contract with Saudi Arabia’s Al Nassr is estimated to be worth more than $200 million. MrBeast has at times stirred controversy, with Mexico in May filing suit against a firm they say worked with him after he produced a video at the nation’s ancient Maya pyramids. – Rappler.com",True,true,World’s top YouTuber MrBeast launches Saudi theme park,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/mrbeast-launches-saudi-arabia-theme-park/,Rappler
"When the Philippines’ largest state pension fund — the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) — finds itself in the crosshairs of governance and investment scrutiny, the headlines are dramatic: a purported ₱8.8-billion loss; a call for the resignation of its president, Jose Arnulfo “Wick” Veloso, and a war of numbers between dissenting trustees and management. Vantage Point combed through GSIS financials, did forensic pencil-pushing and found out a more complex narrative: strong growth, a sizable asset base, and questions over transparency rather than pure performance. This column examines the numbers, the governance issues, and what they mean for the fund’s long-term health. For the year 2024, GSIS reported net income from operations of ₱135.7 billion, up 21% from ₱112.1 billion in 2023. Total income for 2024 was ₱326.86 billion (↑10.29% year-on-year). Total assets at end-2024 were reported at ₱1.83 trillion, up ~9.23% from the prior year. Gross premiums written in its insurance business in 2024 reached ₱10.6 billion (target was ₱8.5 billion). Administrative expenses in 2024 fell to ₱8.92 billion (from ₱10.14 billion), improving the administrative cost ratio from ~3.7% to ~3.0%. Loans to GSIS members grew to ₱370.65 billion in 2024; collection efficiency as of the third quarter (Q3) was 98.6%. Investment gains for the year included: ₱13.27 billion from foreign exchange, ₱11.24 billion from global private equity (via external fund managers), and ₱3.09 billion from local equity investments. The investment portfolio strategy: around 70% in government securities and fixed income, and around 30% in higher-yielding investments, such as equities, real-estate, etc. — all within risk parameters. From these numbers, GSIS appears to be performing strongly at a high level: growing assets, rising income, improved cost-efficiency. The increase in net income and relatively modest administrative cost suggest operational discipline. Its investment strategy is somewhat conservative (70% fixed income and government securities) with a tilt (30%) toward higher yield assets. That may help balance stability vs growth. The membership lending business is growing (₱370 billion loans) and collection efficiency is high (98.6%), which supports the health of that asset base. The insurance business component seems to be doing better than target (gross premiums ₱10.6 billion vs target ₱8.5 billion) which is a promising sign for diversification. However, the net worth of ₱62 billion seems relatively small given the asset base (~₱1.8 trillion). That could raise questions about leverage, reserves, solvency or actuarial liabilities (though I don’t have all the details here). The membership base: according to icrs.gcg.gov.ph, as of March 2025, GSIS had 2,736,710 members and pensioners (2.1 million active members and ~636,000 pensioners). This gives context to the scale of liabilities they carry. While GSIS has expanded its asset base, the net worth — its true equity buffer — stands at only ₱62 billion. When you subtract that from total assets, you arrive at ₱1.768 trillion in liabilities, much of it representing long-term pension and insurance obligations. That figure translates into a debt-to-equity ratio of roughly 28.5 to 1 — meaning that for every peso in equity, GSIS shoulders almost ₱29 pesos in obligations. In the corporate world, that kind of leverage would be alarming. For a pension fund, it’s not automatically a red flag, but it does demand scrutiny. Unlike private firms that can raise equity or restructure debt, GSIS’s “debt” largely consists of actuarial commitments to its members: retirement benefits, life insurance, survivorship claims. These are promises that stretch decades into the future. The fund’s long-term health depends not only on its profits today, but on whether its assets are structured to meet those future claims — what actuaries call asset-liability matching. In October 2025, a group of GSIS trustees and insiders called for the resignation of President and General Manager Jose Arnulfo “Wick” Veloso. They claimed GSIS incurred ₱8.8 billion in losses, attributed to speculative or poorly approved investments and governance lapses (e.g. splitting transactions to avoid board thresholds). But, upon scrutiny, Vantage Point discovered that: Thus: the allegation may raise valid governance and investment risk concerns, but in purely financial terms, it does not yet rise to the level of proving a collapse or systemic meltdown of the fund. Nickel Asia: The only fully-documented paper loss Of the five companies cited — Monde Nissin, Nickel Asia, Bloomberry Resorts, DigiPlus Interactive, and Alternergy Holdings — only the Nickel Asia investment has a clearly documented entry price. In April 2023, GSIS bought 233.6 million shares at ₱6.25 each, for a total of ₱1.46 billion. With Nickel Asia trading at around ₱3.95 today, the paper loss stands at ₱537 million, or 36.8% of the exposure. Still, Nickel Asia has been paying steady dividends. GSIS has likely collected around ₱84 million in cash distributions since 2023, cushioning part of the decline. The stock’s weakness stems mainly from softer global nickel prices, not mismanagement. It is, in investment terms, a “mark-to-market” paper loss — unrealized and reversible. DigiPlus: The outlier winner Where the GSIS has clearly done well is in DigiPlus Interactive Corp., the former Leisure and Resorts World. GSIS invested about ₱1 billion in early 2024, when the stock hovered around ₱10 to ₱12. With the share now trading at ₱22.85, the fund sits on a near-100 percent gain — a potential paper profit of ₱1 billion. In September 2025, the pension fund itself disclosed ₱139 million in realized earnings from this single position. The company’s gaming and digital entertainment turnaround has rewarded early believers, and GSIS’ entry now looks like a prescient bet rather than a reckless plunge. Alternergy: Still under COA’s probe In November 2023, it subscribed to ₱1.45 billion worth of perpetual preferred shares (PPS2-A) — structured to pay 8-10% yearly income, plus an eventual redemption premium that could deliver a total return of roughly 56%, or ₱826 million, over the instrument’s life. We pointed out in a recent column that its market capitalization was way below the minimum required under GSIS investment rules. Alternergy was also heavily leveraged (i.e. high debt relative to equity) and had weak interest coverage, which made it financially risky. We also reported that the shares (preferred shares) purchased by the GSIS were not listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) at the time the agreement and payment were made. Since GSIS rules require investments in listed companies (or at least properly listed securities) for such equity exposures, this non-listing is a violation. The COA, however, still has to wrap up its investigation on these issues. Some analysts point out however, that questions on Alternergy were procedural — focused on documentation and risk classification — not a finding of actual loss. GSIS investment in it is not equivalent to a crashing stock. They say it’s an income asset, not a speculative play. Monde Nissin and Bloomberry: The unverified estimates The two other names, Monde Nissin and Bloomberry Resorts, are where rumor overtakes record. No formal GSIS disclosures exist showing how much or when these positions were acquired. If GSIS bought Monde in mid-2024 at ₱9-₱11, its current ₱7.05 price implies a 20-35% paper loss. Similarly, if it took Bloomberry at ₱7-₱8, the current ₱3.69 level would mean a 50-plus decline. But those remain hypothetical, absent filings or trade records. Market swings do not automatically equate to bad management. Pension funds are long-term investors; they ride cycles, not headlines. The bigger picture: Context matters Is the ₱8.8-billion loss being brandished by critics already realized and catastrophic? The pension fund’s total assets exceed ₱1.6 trillion. Even a full ₱0.5 billion paper loss from Nickel Asia equals just 0.03% of its portfolio — hardly the collapse suggested. Moreover, the combination of DigiPlus’ gains and Alternergy’s fixed-income return likely offsets most of the temporary drawdowns elsewhere. Mark-to-market losses only materialize when an asset is sold below cost. Until then, they are accounting snapshots, not evidence of plunder. Politics vs. performance Still, GSIS must not hide behind technicalities. Transparency is essential when handling workers’ pensions. Every peso invested should be disclosed with cost basis, rationale, and expected yield. The current uproar, in truth, springs as much from opacity as from losses. Veloso’s management should release an audited investment performance report, itemizing realized versus unrealized results. That would silence the rumor mill and allow the public to judge based on arithmetic, not accusation. A forensic verdict The forensic trail shows one confirmed paper loss (Nickel Asia), one clear profit (DigiPlus), and one future income-bearing preferred deal (Alternergy) — not a pattern of reckless gambling, but a diversified portfolio under market conditions. Monde and Bloomberry remain speculative entries without proof. In short: the “₱8.8-billion loss” collapses under forensic scrutiny. If one digs beneath the numbers, the most pressing concern is governance, not just performance. Three core threads emerge: Approval thresholds and transaction splitting: The allegation states that some investments were deliberately “split” into tranches so they stayed below board-approval limits, thereby potentially circumventing required oversight. If true, this is a process violation rather than a bad investment per se. COA is still probing this. Investment allocation and “risk buckets”: GSIS states about 70% of its portfolio is in fixed-income/government securities (in 2024) and the remainder in higher-yield/higher-risk assets (equities, real estate). But the June 2025 note that 72% is in “relatively risk-free” assets suggests some consistency. If speculative investments are hidden within the “higher-risk” bucket and not transparently disclosed, then the oversight weakness lies in classification, transparency and potential concentration risk. Transparency and disclosure: The absence of published breakdowns of realized vs unrealized gains/losses by investment, seen-by-seen board-approval documentation, and external forensic review means stakeholders and pensioners have less visibility than might be ideal for a fund of this size. The call for Veloso’s resignation highlights that some internal trustees have lost confidence — more likely not because of a single loss figure, but because of process and trust. In short: performance is strong; the worry is less about whether investments lost money, but more about how decisions were made and if governance safeguards were adhered to. 1. Realized vs. unrealized losses: Are losses locked in or just paper marks? Unrealized = value has dropped, but you haven’t “cashed it out” yet.Realized = the drop has been locked in by a transaction. Let us say that GSIS bought a bond for ₱1,000,000: If at the end of the year the fair market value is ₱900,000 and they haven’t sold it — there’s an unrealized loss of ₱100,000. If in a subsequent period GSIS decides to sell the bond for ₱880,000 — then the loss of ₱120,000 (₱1,000,000 cost minus ₱880,000 sale) becomes a realized loss once the sale happens. 2. Concentration risk: Are certain holdings dominating the “high-risk” bucket without disclosure? 3. Board documentation: Are approvals properly recorded, limits adhered to, and committees functionally empowered? 4. External audits/forensic reviews: Will the COA or Senate report provide line-by-line clarity? GSIS today stands as a financially robust institution — with strong asset growth, healthy net income and a long actuarial horizon. Yet the drama around a possible ₱8.8-billion loss could be a governance alarm bell. For stakeholders, the path forward is clear: GSIS must go beyond affirming strong results. It must demonstrate that each investment, each approval, and each risk were subject to rigorous, documented oversight. Until that happens, the fund’s strong performance may be overshadowed by the question of whether it’s managed with the discipline and transparency its beneficiaries deserve. GSIS president Wick Veloso in a Viber message to Vantage Point says that under his watch, the pension fund has complied with all these. – Rappler.com",True,true,"[Vantage Point] GSIS at a crossroads: Strength in numbers yes, but strain in governance?",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-gsis-crossroads-strength-numbers-strain-governance/,Rappler
"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – OpenAI is laying the groundwork for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, three people familiar with the matter said, in what could be one of the biggest IPOs of all time. OpenAI is considering filing with securities regulators as soon as the second half of 2026, some of the people said. In preliminary discussions, the company has looked at raising $60 billion at the low end and likely more, the people said. They cautioned that talks are early and plans — including the figures and timing — could change depending on business growth and market conditions. Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar has told some associates the company is aiming for a 2027 listing, the people said. But some advisers predict it could come even sooner, around late 2026. “An IPO is not our focus, so we could not possibly have set a date,” an OpenAI spokesperson said. “We are building a durable business and advancing our mission so everyone benefits from AGI.” The IPO preparations signal a new urgency inside the ChatGPT maker to tap public markets now that a complex restructuring is complete that reduces its reliance on Microsoft. An IPO would open the door to more efficient capital raising and enable larger acquisitions using public stock, helping to finance CEO Sam Altman’s plans to pour trillions of dollars into AI infrastructure, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking. With an annualized revenue run rate expected to reach about $20 billion by year-end, losses are also mounting inside the $500 billion company, the people said. During a livestream on Tuesday, Altman addressed the possibility of going public. “I think it’s fair to say it is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we’ll have,” he said. OpenAI started out as a nonprofit in 2015. A few years later, the company overhauled its structure again so that the nonprofit would have oversight and control over the for-profit arm. The main goal of the nonprofit was to ensure that OpenAI developed AI technology safely, rather than prioritizing profits like a traditional company. This week, OpenAI revamped itself yet again. It is still controlled by a nonprofit, now called the OpenAI Foundation, but the nonprofit has a 26% stake in OpenAI Group and a warrant to receive additional shares if the company hits certain milestones. This change makes the nonprofit a significant stakeholder in OpenAI’s financial success. A successful offering would mark a major win for investors such as SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX. Microsoft, one of its biggest backers, now owns about 27% of the company after investing $13 billion. The deliberations come as AI is driving a surge in public markets. Earlier this year, AI cloud company CoreWeave went public at a $23 billion valuation and has roughly tripled since. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market value, powered by a rally that has cemented its role at the center of the global AI boom. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the possibility of OpenAI going public as early as 2027. – Rappler.com",True,true,OpenAI lays groundwork for juggernaut IPO at up to $1-trillion valuation,https://www.rappler.com/technology/openai-lays-groundwork-initial-public-offering/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Michael V has suited up to portray controversial figure Sarah Discaya after social media users pointed out his striking resemblance to the public works contractor. Discaya made headlines anew in early September when she admitted during a Senate probe that there were instances when her nine construction firms bid for the same government flood control projects. The businesswoman had initially denied the allegations, but after further prodding from Senator Jinggoy Estrada (who was later tagged in alleged flood control kickbacks in Bulacan), Discaya admitted the scheme. But it wasn’t just Discaya’s revelation that stuck out to the public — it was her resemblance to popular Kapuso comedian Michael V. Memes comparing the two figures’ features had begun to surface, and before long, GMA gag show Bubble Gang teased footage and photos of Michael V dressed in a similar garb as that of Discaya’s. In the photos posted by Bubble Gang, Michael V had on a wig mimicking Discaya’s hairstyle, two moles in the same spots Discaya has them on her face, glasses, and similar outfit — consisting of an inner top and blazer. In one photo, Michael V was also holding an umbrella, seemingly alluding to Discaya’s statement in an interview with TV and YouTube personality Julius Babao that she bought one of her luxury vehicles, a Rolls-Royce, because she liked the umbrella built into the car door. Michael V’s character was named Ciala Dismaya, a play on Sarah Discaya’s name, appearing to be referring to the Filipino slang term of shala (meaning fancy) and dismaya (disappointment). The Discayas’ legal counsel, Cornelio Samaniego III, told GMA News that Sarah is aware of Michael V’s impersonation of her. Samaniego debunked rumors that Discaya was angry at the comedian for the skit — adding that the businesswoman is okay with it. The Bubble Gang episode will premiere on Sunday, September 14, at 6:10 pm on GMA Network. Sarah Discaya’s construction firms have since been disqualified from bidding for government projects. The former Pasig City mayoral candidate and her husband, Pacifico “Curlee” Discaya, have also expressed their desire to become state witnesses in the flood control project scandal.

"The Bifrost subsea internet cable system, backed by Meta, Amazon and regional partners, reached “Ready for Service (RFS)” status, Converge said, Monday, October 6, and is expected to begin carrying commercial traffic in the coming weeks. The activation marks the culmination of a multiyear effort to create a resilient new data corridor between Southeast Asia and the US. Spanning over 20,000 kilometers, Bifrost links Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Guam, and the US West Coast, with branching units to Jakarta and Manado in Indonesia, and Davao. Keppel says the system delivers more than 260 terabits per second of capacity, and achieves a round-trip latency of under 165 milliseconds (ms) between Singapore and the US — which it claims is roughly 10 ms faster than many existing transpacific routes. One of Bifrost’s differentiators is its path: it bypasses the South China Sea, instead traversing the Java Sea and Celebes Sea before reaching the Pacific. That routing avoids the geopolitically sensitive waters where many existing cables lie — a strategy meant to reduce vulnerability to conflict, interference, or maritime disruptions. Because of that alternate routing, Bifrost is often described as establishing a parallel “digital highway” that enhances redundancy and reduces risk — another backbone in the network architecture of the Asia-Pacific region. The Bifrost project was first publicly announced in March 2021, when Meta (then Facebook), Singapore’s Keppel, and Indonesia’s PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia International (Telin) committed to build two new transpacific cables, Echo and Bifrost, via a route crossing the Java Sea. In April of that year, Philippine partner Converge came on board. Converge ICT Solutions, Inc. serves as the landing party for the Davao branch. Converge joined the project via agreements with Keppel, and obtained an Indefeasible Right of Use (IRU) — a long-term, permanent contractual right — on a fiber pair in the main trunk. The company said it landed the Bifrost cable in Davao in August 2025. Dennis Anthony Uy, CEO of Converge, said, “This will not only boost the company’s international bandwidth capacity, but for the Philippines, it will mean redundancy and diversity in network infrastructure to power the country’s digital journeys.” Uy also said, quoted by InsiderPH, “We’ve been receiving intense interest from other ISPs, telcos, and communications operators to purchase capacity on this cable for their redundancy, and we’re ready to meet those wholesale requirements. We believe we will make a healthy return on investment in this area.” Indonesia’s Telin, meanwhile, has advanced its own landing station in Manado-Minahasa, breaking ground in late 2024 and formally launching the cable landing station (CLS) in July 2025. For Meta, Bifrost is more than infrastructure — it’s a strategic asset. The company’s platforms (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) and its growing AI and cloud ambitions are directly dependent on high-capacity, low-latency global connectivity. The addition of Bifrost reinforces Meta’s global backbone and helps close gaps in cross-Pacific routing. By offering a second route outside the contested South China Sea, Bifrost strengthens network resilience. If cables in traditional corridors suffer outages — due to accidents, anchoring, maritime disputes or other risks — traffic can shift to Bifrost. That redundancy is especially vital for the Philippines, which is subject to frequent storms, cable disruptions, and regional pressure. Earlier this year, the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) announced plans to harness 2 terabits per second of bandwidth from Meta to boost the government’s National Broadband Plan. This builds on the earlier Luzon Bypass Infrastructure (LBI), where Meta is also a partner. The LBI is a 240-kilometer terrestrial corridor connecting Baler, Aurora to San Fernando, La Union. Still, questions about sovereignty, control, and data access persist, concerning a growing reliance on Meta-owned assets. During the DICT’s budget interpellations in September 2025, ACT Teachers Representative Antonio Tinio voiced these concerns. Tinio warned: “Dapat ultimately kontrolado ng mga Pilipino ang datos ng mga Pilipino … equally important, ay dapat kontrolado ng mga Pilipino ang sariling network or internet ng Pilipinas … Bakit po natin tinataya ang buong National Broadband Network sa imprastruktura ng isang US corporation? … Meta does not recognize the law of the Philippines, but must obey US law. And under US law, the US government wields broad powers for surveillance, especially over foreign governments.” (Ultimately, data about Filipinos should be controlled by Filipinos … equally important, Filipinos should also control the country’s own network or internet infrastructure … Why are we entrusting the entire National Broadband Network to the infrastructure of a US corporation?) He added that “the benefit of having free access to the infrastructure is outweighed by … ensuring sovereignty over our network … that our access is through an entity that is itself under the sovereignty and jurisdiction of our own laws.” FPJ Panday Bayanihan partylist Representative Brian Poe, the DICT’s budget sponsor, responded by pointing to safeguards in existing agreements — such as anti-DDoS clauses, arbitration mechanisms under international law — and noting ongoing efforts to diversify connectivity sources, including engagement with Japanese partners. Meta continues to expand its subsea portfolio: its newly announced Candle cable (to be deployed circa 2028) will connect Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore with 24 fiber pairs and up to 570 Tbps in capacity. With these moves, Meta becomes a larger part of the very infrastructure enabling digital connectivity, especially in Southeast Asia. The new Candle cable is said to have more than double the capacity and about twice less the latency than the recent cables including the Bifrost system. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Bifrost internet cable is ready for service, to operate in ‘coming weeks’",https://www.rappler.com/technology/bifrost-internet-cable-ready-service-status-october-2025/,Rappler
"NEW YORK, USA – Big retailers traditionally spend millions on attracting eyeballs for the holiday season. Now, they’re looking to get noticed by something else — AI agents. Most of this holiday season’s projected $253 billion in US online sales will happen through website visits or standard online searches that favor companies that spend big on search engine ads. But chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini have become part of the mix, with shopper-facing tools that can give product descriptions, compare prices, or allow purchases directly within large-language models as US consumers increasingly use AI for advice on the best holiday stocking stuffers. “We’ve seen brands that previously were putting out three or four new blog posts or articles a month, are now trying to do 100 or 200,” said Brian Stempeck, chief executive at generative engine optimization platform Evertune.ai, which works with clients to make their websites discoverable by large language models. The company charges “around $3,000” per month to its clients, which include apparel and shoe companies, for its services, Stempeck said. Traditionally, retailers based their Google and Meta ad placements on phrases that users searched for or links they previously clicked. Without the ability to advertise in the largest generative AI tools, companies are trying new methods, like posting more frequently on branded blogs or writing about their products on Reddit. Big retailers are building websites that cannot be seen by shoppers, intended to be read solely by AI scrapers, automated data extraction tools that scour the internet for information. The scrapers then feed information to platforms like ChatGPT and Gemini, which then offer suggestions on gifts, apparel and other holiday merchandise. Traffic to retail websites from generative AI platforms is currently still a fraction of overall activity. ChatGPT referrals to Amazon, Walmart and eBay in October accounted for less than 1% of each site’s overall traffic, according to data firm Sensor Tower. EBay said while traffic from AI sources is a small percentage of overall traffic, shoppers finding its links through agentic AI come to the online marketplace with high intent. Walmart did not respond to a request for comment. But retailers clearly see an opportunity. Bed linen company Brooklinen is paying social media influencers to talk about its bath towels and comforters on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok, Brooklinen Chief Operating Officer Rachel Levy said. AI scrapers pull information from the text of product reviews and audio transcripts on these posts. Brooklinen has also submitted its $199 comforter for awards from publications like the New York Times’ Wirecutter to boost its chances of appearing in AI agent responses. Currently, traffic from agentic AI sources is “super small,” she said, because Gen Z, the biggest adopter of tools like ChatGPT, has less buying power than older generations. Miami-based hair care company R+Co is buying ads on Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa based on the questions that customers are asking its Rufus agent, R+Co President Dan Langer said. Google recently introduced features that help shoppers use AI to track prices and buy goods, a task that can only happen if retailers share product details through the tech giant’s merchant center directly or when their products are easily found by its scrapers. Its AI mode and Gemini chatbot consider numerous factors, such as store locations or retailer quality when referring links to users, said Lilian Rincon, vice president of product for Google Shopping. Google is testing ads in AI Mode currently in the U.S., but not the Gemini app, the company said. Existing Shopping and Performance Max ad product campaigns are eligible to show up in AI mode through the testing, the company said. ChatGPT on Monday released additional shopping features to help people with product comparisons and search for “lookalikes” merchandise. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on the company’s October earnings call that shoppers who use Rufus are 60% more likely to buy products. Among large retailers, Walmart and Target both recently announced plans for apps to allow people to shop directly with chatbots. – Rappler.com",True,true,"As AI reshapes shopping, US retailers try to change how they’re seen online",https://www.rappler.com/technology/ai-reshaping-us-shopping-retailers-adapt/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines’ unemployment rate worsened to 5% in October 2025 as the labor market struggled to absorb an influx of job seekers, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Wednesday, December 10. The latest unemployment figure translates to 2.54 million jobless Filipinos, which is higher than the 3.8% or 1.96 million Filipinos recorded in September 2025 and the 3.9% or 1.97 million jobless Filipinos logged in October 2024. Underemployment in October also grew to 12%, equivalent to 5.81 million Filipinos, from 11.1% or 5.52 million Filipinos in September. National Statistician Dennis Mapa noted an increase in labor force participation, which includes Filipinos who are working and seeking jobs. “Ang labor force participation tumaas ng mga 1.04 million…. Out of those additional na nag-participate, 463,000 ang nagkaroon ng trabaho at 576,000 ay hindi nagkaroon ng trabaho,” he explained. (Labor force participation went up by around 1.04 million. Out of those additional people who participated, 463,000 got jobs and 576,000 did not.) The public administration sector added the most jobs in October year-on-year with 257,000 additional workers. Jobs in agriculture and manufacturing — two sectors which often shed jobs earlier in the year — also gained more workers in October. Mapa attributed the agriculture sector’s job gains to a surge in jobs tied to the growing of palay, which he noted usually peaks in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, jobs in other service activities such as computer repairs, personal and household goods, laundry services, and domestic services dropped by 520,000 year-on-year. The number of Filipinos aged 15 to 24 years old who are not working or studying also increased to 13% or 2.62 million young Filipinos. The Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) vowed to integrate labor market information to improve industry-skills matching. DEPDev Secretary Arsenio Balisacan also noted that generating more quality jobs depends on the implementation of the Trabaho Para sa Bayan Plan and the Philippine Development Plan. “Guided by these plans, the government will boost workforce competitiveness by accelerating learning pathways and expanding lifelong learning opportunities, equipping workers with in-demand skills such as digital literacy, green technology capabilities, and expertise in higher-value services,” he said. – with reports from Arriane dela Cruz/Rappler.com Arriane dela Cruz is a Rappler intern.

"MANILA, Philippines – “Born to be a traveler, forced to be a weak passport holder.” Most Filipinos can relate to this viral social media saying. With the Philippines standing only at 73rd in the 2024 Global Passport Ranking, Filipinos can only access 67 countries visa-free. Between endless paperwork and draining your hard-earned savings, applying for visas can be enough to clip anyone’s wings for the dream of world travel. But Kach Umandap, who brings Filipino pride for being the first-ever Filipina as of 2025 to have traveled 193 countries, says there’s a way to steer over the stressful visa application each time. Here are her six tried-and-tested international travel hacks for Filipinos who want to expand their horizons! Kach’s top tip for overcoming the limitations of the weak Philippine passport is to keep moving forward, quite literally. Growing up in the generation of Susan Calo-Medina, host of travel documentary show Travel Time, Kach admits that she’s always wanted to travel for leisure but never knew how to start. When Kach was living in Kuwait as an overseas Filipino worker (OFW), she was able to maximize the myriad of holidays in the Middle East, going on to visit nearby countries like Armenia, Georgia, and Sri Lanka. Many may find it strange to know that Kach doesn’t fly straight home after visiting another country, but it’s all a part of her travel strategy. Instead of booking roundtrip tickets to the Philippines, she plans onward journeys. This way, she saves time by skipping visa reapplications back home and saves money by avoiding multiple roundtrip fares. She’d only need to budget for one ticket home to the Philippines once she’s done exploring nearby countries. “When I was in South America, I made Colombia my base. That’s where I even got my USA Visa. When I was there, I travelled to America and then when I moved to Europe, I went to Montenegro. If you have a Japanese visa, you can enter a few countries in Eastern Europe without a European visa, just a Japanese visa,” she explained during the launch of World Traveller’s Travel Tales talk series. All you need to do is prove that you’re traveling onward. “The secret in all visa applications is writing a very good cover letter and why you are moving to another country. You always talk about going there and what’s next, not about going home,” she added. What better way to catch up with friends than by visiting them in their hometown? It’s like hitting two birds with one stone as you enjoy their company while savoring local dishes and exploring popular tourist spots. If they are kind enough to host you, they can help you get around more easily and even protect you from potential scammers. So before you even go abroad, check one of your friends who are in those countries. This way, you’re “not really intimidated to know saan pupunta, baka puwedeng may mag-host sa ‘yo, or baka puwedeng makatulong sayo (where you’re going; there might be someone to host you or help you) in these places.” One of Kach’s smart habits is to reach out to an older local resident before arriving in a new country, ensuring she has someone who can look out for her during her stay. A post shared by Kach Medina Umandap (@kach.umandap) “In some planes, airports, or check-ins, I look for [what I call] ‘Momma.’ Most of the time, every day they would check on me and then I keep reporting…I would tell new people that I meet that I know someone here,” she shared. While it’s common knowledge that bringing US dollars often gets you better exchange rates, where you exchange them into local currency also makes a big difference. Many travelers head straight to currency exchange counters at the airport, but Kach points out that depending on the country, you can usually find much better rates elsewhere. Kach also reminds travelers to pay attention to each country’s payment systems. For example, in Uruguay, US dollars have little use. However, they accept international credit card payments with an automatic 22% discount. Starting her travel journey also meant looking for practical, low-cost alternatives. But Kach explains that DIY travel isn’t always the best choice. Sometimes, it depends on the country you plan to visit. In destinations that require a visa, group trips often provide more convenience, offering stronger documentation support and smoother passage through immigration. In Asia, however, DIY travel is often the more practical option. A post shared by Kach Medina Umandap (@kach.umandap) When you travel as frequently as Kach does, saving as much as you can may seem like it’s always the way to go. But that shouldn’t always be the case, especially when it comes to your safety. It’s okay to spend a little extra on lodging or group tours if it means you don’t have to worry about potentially finding yourself in danger — especially if you’re a solo female traveler. In some more expensive destinations, there are still budget-friendly options that already offer good quality. Kach began her nomadic journey in Southeast Asia in what backpackers call the “banana pancake trail,” which goes from Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. In her six-month stay in Vietnam, she needed a reliable source of income, so she started teaching English online. To support her travels further, she launched her own travel blog in 2024 called the Two Monkeys Travel Group. Being a digital nomad is a completely different lifestyle. It’s not just freelancing, where you may control your time but don’t always have a steady income. It’s about working on the go, securing stable sources of earnings while traveling, and adjusting your finances, schedule, and living arrangements around your upcoming trips. In other words, it is a commitment. But of course, devoting herself fully to the spirit of travel, she realized that the financial shift into becoming a digital nomad begins with building digital skills and finding remote work. Despite having a weak passport, Kach believes Filipinos are capable of becoming seasoned explorers. For her, the best way to give back to the Philippines is sharing her knowledge and experiences to her fellow Filipinos. Kach plans on doing that through her upcoming Taglish booklet, How to Become a Digital Nomad, published by Penguin. Next year, she plans to embark on her next 12-year mission, “1642,” where she aims to travel across the Philippines by visiting the 1,642 cities and municipalities, and distribute the book to inspire the next generation. – Trixia Policarpio/Rappler.com Trixia Policarpio is a Rappler intern studying BA Creative Writing at University of the Philippines Diliman.",True,true,"6 travel hacks from Kach Umandap, the first Filipina to visit 193 countries",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/tips-kach-umandap-filipina-traveler/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – As Filipinos, ending a meal with something sweet is almost certain. But among our long list of countless dessert options, nothing feels more Pinoy than the mix of shaved ice, milk, jellies, flan, macapuno, sweet beans, and fruit, a dessert that truly lives up to its name: halo-halo. Sam Karazi knows this well. The president and CEO of Bebang Halo-Halo understands the country’s love for the classic treat, even if, ironically, he’s allergic to dairy. Born from the recipe of Mae Salumbides’ grandmother Bebang, the premium version of the classic dessert traces its humble start in 2021, in a modest sari-sari–style garage setup in Quezon City. Today, Bebang Halo-Halo’s emerald-and-gold storefronts have more than 30 branches nationwide. How did a fairly new contender get to this point, given the very saturated halo-halo market? “I would say it’s modern halo-halo with deep respect for tradition. We protect the soul of halo-halo, the layers, the familiar flavors, the idea of sharing something cold and fun with family and friends. But we refuse to be trapped by ‘ganyan na yan ever since (it has always been like that),” Karazi told Rappler. Karazi, who was born and raised in Lebanon, landed in the Philippines in 2011. He instantly recognized the Filipino love of food. However, like any other sharp-eyed businessman, he also recognized the points of improvement. “I also saw a lot of missed opportunities, products that could be so much better with just a few changes,” he said. Halo-halo, for instance, is a staple dessert in most Filipino menus. Unfortunately, that was simply what it was, an option from the long list of others. Part of its charm as a classic was also due to its formulaic way of making. But Karazi thought differently. “I would never invest in a business just to do the same thing as everybody else. So yes, moving away from the usual formula was intentional from the start. But we didn’t change things just to be ‘different.’ We changed things to make the product better and to match what real customers were telling us. We listened,” Karazi said. The moment the “okay, this is it” feeling lodged itself in his gut was amidst the long lines at Mae’s garage setup. “They were willing to wait, reordering, and telling their friends. I remember looking at it and thinking: This is not just dessert, this is a serious business hiding in a plastic chair and a few monobloc tables.” Eventually, Bebang Halo-Halo opened its first proper branch along Shaw Boulevard. Mae’s recipe was already a solid foundation. Improving upon her Lola Bebang’s method of using shaved frozen full-cream milk instead of regular ice, they paired it with premium ingredients like leche flan, macapuno, ube halaya, and banana with cinnamon. The result is a delicately airy, icy base that’s both light and creamy, with a cinnamon-forward taste. Their recipe was also heavily feedback-based. As Karazi shared, “We also removed ingredients people keep saying they don’t really like, like beans and monggo…. Even our leche flan recipe was changed multiple times until it reached the level we wanted.” Bebang Halo-Halo boomed online, considering that it started during the pandemic. Its virality was a manifestation of both the product and the well-crafted storyline told on social media. “We are very intentional with marketing. From day one, we invested in content, in paid ads, in our own ordering channels, in how the product looks on camera,” Karazi said. The fun, slightly dramatic, and very Filipino branding personality shaped their entire social media, store designs, and even how Karazi communicates in interviews. The center of this online buzz was the Royal Halo-Halo topped with 24k gold in 2022. The already premium Bebang halo-halo now glittered with real gold and came with a gold spoon, priced at almost P500, a detail that immediately captured the netizens’ attention. Content creators amplified the conversation, especially figures like Abi Marquez, whose honest reactions added credibility. “Reaching out to creators like Abi was a conscious move, but I told her, ‘If you don’t like it, don’t pretend.’ That honesty also helped because people trust that kind of content more,” Karazi shared. After the post happened, the main concern was whether people would return. And they did. The product proved itself, perpetuating a cycle of customers tasting, bringing families and friends, and sharing their own posts online. As Karazi puts it, “One video can get you attention, but thousands of repeat orders and long lines month after month, that’s another story.” Long story short: “We gave people something worth talking about, and we made sure the experience matched the noise.” Starting a business is hard, and starting one during a pandemic raises the stakes even higher. Fortunately, Karazi believed not only in the strength of the product but also in the silver lining hiding within what many assumed was an already crowded market. “So you have a market that loves halo-halo, a product that is clearly better than average, and a category where most of the big players treat halo-halo as just one item on a long menu. For me, that combination is the best signal: saturated on paper, but still underserved in reality,” he said. Their level of confidence involved replacing and refunding melted halo-halo by investing in R&D and packaging, a solution that ensured frozen desserts could be delivered properly. Then, they created their own direct channels and ordering systems from day one. “That gave us data, control, and a direct relationship with our customers.” Data insight and customer feedback move in tandem within their brand model. “I use data to narrow down the options, foot traffic, tenant mix, presence of premium brands, purchasing power in the area, performance of nearby branches, etc. Once we have that, I use gut feel to decide if the location really feels like a ‘Bebang’ location or not,” he shared. Since the storyline is entirely dependent on halo-halo, the star of the show must also have an ensemble of cast to fulfill its role. Karazi said serving an amazing product but lacking in other areas, such as “weak, food quality, service, cleanliness,” will ultimately hurt the brand in the long run. “We try not to repeat that mistake. If we say we’re premium, everything around the cup has to feel premium too.” Oversaturation only becomes a problem when a brand enters with nothing new to offer. But if the product is truly superior, there will always be space. This belief grounded every decision Bebang Halo-Halo made, as everything had to prove it deserved a seat at the table. “Respect your customer’s intelligence. They notice everything. If you promise premium and deliver average, they will know,” Karazi said. Karazi ’s leadership style shifts naturally with the company’s growth. In the early stages of any project, he prefers to stay deeply involved. “I am very hands-on and very protective. I like to be the only cook in the kitchen when something like new concepts, new deals, new structures are still fragile.” His directness stems from the same place of commitment to safeguarding the company and the people doing their best, matched with a low tolerance for laziness, politics, and anything that drags the work down. But once trust is established, he steps back with confidence. “Once I trust someone, I delegate a lot. I really don’t like micromanaging. If I see that a person is smart, motivated, and aligned, I’d rather give them space and judge them on results, not on how many times they message me per day,” he said. Despite the inevitable stress of running a fast-growing business, he still finds joy in the process. “And of course, I enjoy the game. Business is stressful, but it’s also fun if you see it as a long-term game, not a one-time bet,” he said.

"MANILA, Philippines – Corruption is not just about stolen money — it’s about stolen futures. The ongoing investigation into the flood control scandal is a stark reminder that billions of pesos meant for public safety often end up in private pockets. The question is, how do we stop this? Three accountability tools — SALN, lifestyle checks, and citizen vigilance — can finally make the powerful answer for their unexplained wealth. The Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth or SALN is not just a form — it’s the most powerful weapon against corruption. Required under Article XI, Section 17 of the 1987 Constitution and Republic Act 6713, it compels every government official — from barangay captains to the president — to declare their total assets, liabilities, and relatives in government every year. By comparing an official’s declared net worth with their lawful income, the public and authorities can uncover unexplained wealth — a clear red flag for corruption, bribery, or kickbacks from government contracts. Ask this: Penalty reminder: Because public office is a public trust — not a business opportunity — the SALN exists to protect taxpayers, not to protect the corrupt. A lifestyle check is more than a moral test — it’s a financial investigation into where the money really comes from. Conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman, it determines if an official’s lifestyle and assets are grossly disproportionate to their lawful income. In scandals like the flood control kickback scheme, investigators can cross-match SALN, income tax returns, and BIR records with land titles, vehicle registrations, and business interests. When an official earning just six figures suddenly lives like a billionaire, that’s not success — that’s suspicious wealth. How it works: Findings: Disproportionate assets = probable violation of the Anti-Graft Law (Republic Act 3019), Plunder Law (RA 7080), and possible tax evasion under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC). So, how can some officials, with these salaries, own billion-peso properties, luxury fleets, and lavish overseas vacations? Here’s the truth: Even the notorious gangster Al Capone wasn’t convicted for murder — he was caught for tax evasion. That’s the same principle our BIR can use today. By conducting risk-based lifestyle audits with the COA and the Ombudsman, we can trace hidden kickbacks through undeclared income and fake expenses — and finally prosecute corrupt officials for tax evasion, with penalties including imprisonment, asset forfeiture, and perpetual disqualification from public office. Because corruption may hide behind influence and position, but it always leaves a trail in the taxes they didn’t pay. We don’t have to wait for whistleblowers. In the digital age, every Filipino can be a corruption watchdog. A platform like “e-SumbongMo” can empower citizens to submit photos, property records, or social media evidence exposing officials’ lavish lifestyles, fake costs, or undeclared assets — safely, anonymously, and directly to authorities. How it should work: Imagine this: If every Filipino could report a corrupt politician with a photo or document as easily as reporting a crime, how many would still dare to steal? Because accountability begins when citizens see something and say something — and government finally listens. The flood control scandal is not an isolated case — it’s a symptom of a deeper disease that thrives on impunity and silence. Until the government strictly enforces SALN compliance, conducts risk-based lifestyle audits, and builds a real-time citizen reporting system, corruption will remain business as usual. As I always say: “Stop auditing ordinary taxpayers. Audit corrupt politicians and their family businesses. If we can’t recover all the stolen money, at least make sure they never steal again.” – Rappler.com Reference/s:",True,true,"[Ask the Tax Whiz] How SALN, lifestyle checks, and citizen action can expose corruption",https://www.rappler.com/business/ask-the-tax-whiz-how-saln-lifestyle-checks-citizen-action-expose-corruption/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The pioneering voice of Filipino food literature lives on as two republished editions of renowned author Doreen Fernandez’s books will be returning to shelves this October. SARAP: Essays on Philippine Food and PALAYOK: Philippine Food Through Time, On Site, In the Pot were both written by Tikim author Doreen G. Fernandez. The former was co-written by Edilberto N. Alegre, also a literary figure in Filipino food culture and research. They are set to be republished by local publisher Exploding Galaxies. Both “lost classics” will be available for purchase via Exploding Galaxies’ website starting October 15, and in select branches of National Book Store, Fully Booked, Kultura, Baguio’s Mt. Cloud Bookshop, and Makati’s Everything’s Fine. Published in 1988, SARAP is a collection of essays written and compiled by Fernandez and Alegre about the life and ways of Filipino food. Alegre referred to Fernandez as his “indefatigable editor, dear friend, and comrade of many battles.” In this new edition, the essays will be paired with original illustrations by four artists — Gianne Encarnacion, Kitty Jardenil, Elle Shivers, and Eva Yu — with book design by Kristian Henson. According to historian Amberth Ocampo, Fernandez described food as not just for eating “but a past unearthed from historical sources, an experience tasted and documented, a window into the Filipino soul.” “Her appeal has not paled, nearing a quarter of a century after she passed. Her work as a pioneering food critic and food historian of the Philippines continues to inspire through her elegant prose that teaches us to taste, contextualize, and appreciate the world around us,” Ocampo said. Some riveting excerpts from SARAP include words from Alegre: “The market is never without people. At night, fruit and vegetables are delivered in the wholesale area, and in the early morning, the fishmongers and other vegetable dealers are back early from Malabon or Divisoria. Even during slack hours, the stalls are kept open, for the Philippine market never sleeps.“ Meanwhile, Fernandez wrote: “So, squeeze calamansi on your food; sprinkle it with patis; dip it in vinegar sprinkled with crushed garlic, black pepper, or incendiary chilis…. Surround yourself, if you so please, with a galaxy of little saucers containing different flavor-teasing combinations.“ PALAYOK: Philippine Food Through Time, On Site, In the Pot was first published 25 years ago. In the book, Fernandez detailed the evolution of Philippine cuisine, from its origins to the present day. In this new edition, her writing is accompanied by photographs by Jilson Tiu, featuring the eateries of Manila and daily Philippine scenes — fishnets, fermentation, kitchens, and fiestas all over the country. The book was designed by Miguel Mari. “Food to the Filipino is history. It is also bond, culture, and identity,” Fernandez wrote. “We know our landscape, and have tasted its nuances. From it we derive these subtleties of healing, flavor, and pleasure.” Fernandez and Alegre have worked on several books together, including Lasa: A Guide to 100 Restaurants, Kinilaw, and the two-part series, Writers & Their Milieu: An Oral History of Second Generation Writers in English. Born in 1934 and died in 2002, Fernandez is known for her pioneering work on food as culture. For 34 years, she wrote “in insightful and evocative prose” about Filipino food as a gateway to understanding identity and culture. She wrote over 15 books, contributing to scholarly publications, columns, papers, and conferences both locally and abroad. Aside from being a food and culture writer, Fernandez was a well-loved teacher of the Departments of English and Communication and Interdisciplinary Studies at Ateneo de Manila University. Alegre, who was born in 1938 and died in 2009, was a poet, writer, columnist, and researcher, who helped shape Philippine culture through language and literature. He propounded the theory of indigenization based on his linguistic study of Filipino and developed a decolonized framework to better understand identity in the domain of food. His written works include Inumang Pinoy, Pinoy Forever: Essays on Culture and Language, Pinoy na Pinoy: Essays on National Culture, and Biyaheng Pinoy: A Mindanao Travelogue, released posthumously. The writers’ families expressed happiness over the effort to republish these books, with Fernandez’s niece Maya Besa Roxas ecstatic that her Tita Doreen continues to be discovered and rediscovered by new generations of readers, even 23 years after she passed. Lakan Uhay Alegre, son of Alegre, said: “In college, when I was already reading more of Tatay’s works, I had found out that there were limited copies of Sarap, and that its market value had quadrupled from its original selling price. How can scholars truly understand Filipino food if Sarap, a canon on Filipino food studies, remains rare and inaccessible?” “Republishing Sarap comes with making invaluable knowledge on Filipino food affordable. Like freshly caught sapsap sold at the talipapa, the republication of Sarap is a blessing,” he added. Joycie Dorado Alegre, wife of Alegre, also shared her delight about the reprint of both books. “Their seminal works will fill the vacuum of savoring and at the same time understanding Filipino food and distinctive Filipino cultural identity in terms of gustatory and thinking experiences today.” With this republishing, Roxas hopes that both young and old readers can approach the new editions “with curious and open minds, and with generosity and respect.” “May it stir in them recognition, and pride, and pleasure,” she said. Hopefully, it encourages more people not just to enjoy eating but to visit markets, cook local, and go for food adventures, Alegre’s wife said. The publication of Sarap and Palayok marks Exploding Galaxies’ first nonfiction foray. They hope to rediscover and reprint more titles on food, coming off the excitement of featuring “two humble giants who were not only the best guides to Filipino food culture but among our most important voices in Philippine literature,” they said. These two books had not been republished since Sarap was first released in 1988 and Palayok in 2000. The publisher has released three novels so far: But for the Lovers by Wilfrido D. Nolledo, The Three-Cornered Sun by Linda Ty-Casper, and The Firewalkers by Erwin E. Castillo. – Rappler.com",True,true,Republished editions of two Doreen Fernandez classics to hit shelves,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/literature/republished-sarap-palayok-books-doreen-fernandez/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – On February 10, Chinese New Year (or Lunar New Year) celebrations will usher in the Year of the Wood Dragon. In the Chinese zodiac, 12 animals move around their zodiac cycle. In order, they are the Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. With 2024 being the Year of the Dragon, that means that 2023 was the Year of Rabbit while 2025 will be the Year of Snake. These animals are also affiliated with five elements – fire, wood, earth, metal, and water – where each element has unique traits and specific behavioral patterns associated with them. As each animal reappears after 12 years, its elemental affiliation will also change. For example, 2024 is the Year of the Wood Dragon, but in 2012, it was the Year of the Water Dragon, and in 2036, it will be the Year of the Fire Dragon. In general, the dragon is often associated with confidence, success, adventurousness, and intelligence while the wood characteristics include ambitiousness, vitality, and determination, making 2024 a year of abundance. When it comes to individual animal signs, here’s what you can look forward to based on a reading forecast by Joey Yap. Yap is the founder of the Mastery Academy of Chinese Metaphysics, a global organization devoted to the teaching of Feng Shui, BaZi, Qi Men Dun Jia, Mian Xiang, and other Chinese Metaphysics subjects. According to Yap, the 12 zodiac signs can be sorted into four major groups for 2024: “tenacious challengers,” “chance champions,” “skillful strivers,” and “fortune masters.” The first group, tenacious challengers, include those with signs of the dragon, monkey, or rabbit. These signs are advised to maintain their resilience and persistence, especially on challenging days, as it will push them to initiate plans. Next is the chance champions group composed of those with signs of the goat, rooster, and tiger. According to Yap, individuals with these signs will have plenty of opportunities meeting the right people at the right place. However, they also have a “high possibility of some windfall.” Meanwhile, those with signs of the horse, rat, or dog fall under the third group – skillful strivers. Individuals with these signs are predicted to have remarkable growth in many aspects: personally, professionally, financially, emotionally, and spiritually. It’ll also be a year of pursuing things for yourself and setting up new aspirations. Lastly is the fortune masters group, composed of those with signs of the snake, ox, and pig. According to Yap, these signs will be blessed with new opportunities, beginnings, and connections for 2024. However, they’re also advised to be keen in evaluating which ones to say yes and no to. Yap also has some brief notes for each animal sign. If you prefer a more detailed and in-depth reading for your sign, he also has specific videos for them.

"MANILA, Philippines – Christmas and New Year are often described as festive, with families and friends reuniting and catching up after months of work and routine. But for some, the holidays bring stress. In a report released by the Department of Health (DOH) on Monday, December 29, the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) received 675 calls since December 21. Most frequent callers, the DOH said, are those aged 18 to 30. It added that the majority of the callers are female. The most common reason for reaching out was symptoms of anxiety or depression, followed by relationship issues and family problems. Clinical psychologist Rea Villa shared that she has a surge of patients — many of which were first-time patients — during the holidays. “From a [psychologist’s] perspective, ‘yung holidays kasi amplify what we call emotional load. So, ito, combination kasi ‘yung emotional load ng pressure, expectations, responsibilities, and actually, mga unresolved emotions,” Villa told Rappler. (From a psychologist’s perspective, holidays amplify what we call emotional load – it is a combination of pressure, expectations, responsibilities, and unresolved emotions.) Villa said there are several factors that affect a person’s mental health: psychological, social, economic, and biological. Psychological factors include unresolved grief and past trauma. Some social factors, meanwhile, are family conflict and receiving unsolicited comments. Financial constraints and gift-giving pressure fall under economic factors. Biological factors such as disrupted sleep, increased alcohol consumption, and lack of routine also affect mental health. “‘Yung mental health [issue] kasi in general is never caused by just one thing; interaction siya ng stressors without enough emotional recovery,” Villa said. (A mental health issue, in general, is never caused by just one thing; but by an interaction of stressors without enough emotional recovery.) If a person is already experiencing a toll on their mental health, Villa said the first step is to acknowledge the feeling. “It’s always good to ask why. Bakit ka nalulungkot? Are there reasons for it or ano kaya ‘yun? Introspection ‘yung kailangan, like a deep reflection of yourself and what’s happening would help a lot,” she said. (Why are you sad? Are there reasons for it, what are those? We need introspection, like a deep reflection of yourself and what’s happening would help a lot.) Villa said it would also help to have safe social support. Social support means having people you can lean on and who make you feel heard. A person should also have coping mechanisms that can help soothe them when they feel overwhelmed. Among the coping mechanisms are journaling, meditating, and going out with friends. Villa said coping mechanisms vary, depending on the person’s preference. But when feelings of hopelessness or thoughts of self-harm intensify, they should immediately seek help. Those struggling with their mental health may call the NCMH Crisis Hotline at 1553. Villa further advised the public to be conscious and sensitive of their words and actions as it may be hurtful for others. “[The] holiday season doesn’t need to be emotionally perfect to be meaningful. Sometimes, choosing being gentle, being kind, having that support is the healthiest way to honor the season and to honor yourself,” she said. As the New Year approaches, Villa urged people to be kinder to themselves, move at their own pace, let go of what drained them, and carry forward what helped them survive — as they prepare mentally for the year ahead. – Rappler.com",True,true,Caring for mental health during the holidays,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/mental-health-holidays/,Rappler
"Are you up for an eccentric adventure – one where you don’t need to buckle your seat belt or buy a ticket, but may instead find yourself tucked into a warm blanket? If you are, then cozy up! This “trip” virtually takes you to different places in the Philippines through the magic of binge-watching local films. For cinephiles and casual moviegoers alike, the experience is not only about resonating with a film’s storyline but also about being enthralled by the places where its scenes come to life. Whether a spot is buried in or woven directly into the plot, it’s undeniable that a film’s shooting location shapes the overall movie experience. Jazz in Love documents the love story of young gay man Jazz with a German military staff, Theodor. This film is set in Jazz’s hometown, Malita, Davao Occidental, where he learns the Deutsch language as part of Germany’s migration requirement. Jazz introduces Theodor to the Davaoeno culture during his birthday visit to the province. The film showcases the place’s rich natural environment, but more than that, it serves as a moving snapshot of the locals’ everyday lives. Watch the full movie here. Can’t get enough of Baguio City? Then the iconic That Thing Called Tadhana is perfect for you. The movie follows Mace (Angelica Panganiban) and Anthony (JM de Guzman) on a spontaneous adventure in Baguio City and Sagada. Mace and Anthony are both heartbroken; they are trying to run off painful emotions and experiences. This storyline, together with the film’s astounding cinematography, romanticizes the highlands’ escapist charm, especially for people living in the lowlands. The film passes by several tourist hotspots in Baguio City, like the BenCab Museum and Cafe by the Ruins. It further spotlights Sagada’s Mt. Kiltepan, where the peak reaches and exceeds the clouds. In Crazy Beautiful You, black sheep child Jackie (Kathryn Bernardo) meets her total opposite, Kiko (Daniel Padilla), when she was forced to tag along on her mother’s medical mission in Capas, Tarlac. Beyond the unwinding love story between the two teenagers — and the undertone of growing up in dysfunctional families — the film accentuates the Aeta community in Sitio Tarukan, Capas, and showcases the pulling scenery of Lake and Mt. Pinatubo, the beautiful results of a volcanic disaster. Following heartbroken Cielo (Alessandra De Rossi) on her local adventure — in a quest to find her mystery post-card sender and in hopes of developing a new romantic connection — Sakaling Hindi Makarating features five different provinces from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. For one, the film highlights Zamboanga’s rich culture and tradition through the Regatta de Zamboanga festival, an annual boat race that stresses not just the province’s affluent maritime heritage, but also the Chavaconos’ creativity and excellent boat craftsmanship. Along her journey, Cielo learns to appreciate Marinduque’s wood artistry, too, as Manuel (JC Santos) teaches her how to make a wood mask, an essential to the province’s famous holy-week tradition, Moriones Festival. Apart from these spots, Sakaling Hindi Makarating captures so well the alluring sceneries of Siquijor, Ilocos Norte (Pagudpud), and Batanes (Basco). Together with her sons, Jude (Chai Fonacier), Jay (Melde Montañez), and Hubert (Vincent Viado), and their dog Judas, single mother Iyay (Jacklyn Jose) goes on a long road trip from Cebu to Dumaguete City to attend the wake of her children’s father. Crammed together in a red mini-van, the dysfunctional family humorously confronts matters within and beyond the social unit. The trip takes on different stops in Cebu province, including San Fernando, Carcar City, Sibonga, and Santander. Among the featured locations in Patay na si Hesus are Pitalo Chapel and Simala Shrine. When the family reaches Dumaguete, a closer relationship apparently develops, as seen in the scene set in Rizal Boulevard, where the three sons talk about their wake preferences while indulging in a box of the city’s delicacy, silvanas. Filmed around different locations in La Union, My Amanda can arguably stand alone with its storyline: life-long friends Fuffy (Piolo Pascual) and Fream (Alessandra De Rossi) navigate different life stages together — from a loop of endings, to a completely new beginning. However, the film is, dare to say, a complete package. The setting of each scene, enhanced by excellent videography and color grading, just adds more depth to the story. For instance, Fuffy and Fream’s comical and intimate conversations become even more soulful — and literally, beautiful — because they were either set under the stars, on a beach at night, or on a road that looks like a tunnel of canopy trees. These scenes were filmed in Paraoir Man Made Forest located along a 500-meter highway in Almeida, Balaoan, the coastal areas in San Juan, and the Thunderbird Resort Poro Point in the city of San Fernando. This movie captures not only an unfolding love story between former schoolmates Dee (Janine Guiterrez) and Endong (Pepe Herrera), but also the pristine beauty of the Bicol region — in a successful attempt to showcase the rich natural environment of the film’s two featured provinces. Set in Cagraray, Albay (particularly in Misibis Bay), and Bulusan, Sorsogon, Ikaw serves as a snapshot of the simple, often conservative lifestyle of Bicolanos, as well as their value of having a tight knit community. It also pictures the region’s primary livelihood, agriculture, through Endong’s small “kupra” (coconut) business. Strangers Uly (Carlos Aquino) and Ikay (Eisel Serrano) turn into lovers, in one place, but in two entirely different timezones — all because of mysterious two-way radios. The storyline of Love You Long Time may be enough reason to watch the film, after all, it takes inspiration from Kimi no Na wa, a Japanese animated film that Filipinos have come to love. However, beyond the plot, the movie proves the undying appeal of Baguio City, featuring some of its famous spots like the Mountain Lodge Hotel and Wright Park. Love You Long Time also takes its shot to showcase the natural, captivating beauty of Atok, Benguet — the home of Luzon’s third highest mountain, Mt. Timbak, and various flower hotspots like the Northern Blossom Flower Farm and Sakura Park. A psychological thriller might not be the first thing you’ll reach for when you want to get a glimpse of a province’s beauty, but trust us on this. Outside follows the story of Francis (Sid Lucero) and his family, his wife Iris (Beauty Gonzales), and their children Joshua (Marco Masa) and Lucas (Aiden Tyler Patdu), as they unpack personal and family baggage in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. Outside is filmed in La Carlota and Kabankalan cities in Negros Occidental, showcasing sugar fields and abandoned sites that, when color graded on the mark, evokes eerie visual scenes. One of the particular locations spotlighted in the film is St. Francis Xavier Cathedral. This film itinerary attests that tourist spots are no longer beyond your reach. Thanks to moving pictures and streaming platforms, you can now go on an adventure — this time, in the comfort of your own bed, or in the solace of your third place. – Rappler.com Deanne Reese Imperial is a Rappler intern studying journalism at the University of Santo Tomas.",True,true,Virtual travel?

"MANILA, Philippines – Ever wonder what happens to secondhand kimonos from Japan? As no two kimonos are ever the same, each piece is often owned by families and passed down through generations. But what happens when the younger ones no longer wear the traditional Japanese robe that their grandparents used to? The premium silk or cotton fabric and the intricate hand-drawn designs risk being discarded, ending their lineage — thrown away, never to be worn again. But not on Marjorie Resuello-Kobayashi’s watch. The 32-year-old Filipino lecturer and entrepreneur based in Laguna saw an opportunity to bridge the two cultures she loves, guided by her advocacy for sustainability. Why not take these discarded kimonos and sew new life into them? As they say, another man’s trash is another woman’s handwoven treasure, and for Marjorie, this saying became the catalyst of her family-run business, Cool Kimono Crafts, which slowly stitched itself up in 2021, starting with handsewn face masks made from discarded kimono cloth patches. Today, the Cool Kimono Crafts line uses the cultural beauty, smooth fabric, and distinctly intricate patterns of kimonos and transforms them into Filipiniana pieces — traditional sleeves and cuts reimagined as modern Filipiniana formalwear, barong, or even casual t-shirts for men and women. Her creations have already made it to London and New York Fashion Week runways, worn proudly not just by models of all ages and sizes but also by people from around the world who take pride in wearing two pieces of Asian culture in one stylish garment. Cool Kimono Crafts made its artisanal local debut at ArteFino Fair in Rockwell last August; her hybrid creations presented on mannequins stopped amazed fairgoers in their tracks. “I was so surprised about the reception, especially since it was my first time, and my booth setup was so simple compared to other, more established brands. I was so nervous,” Marjorie told Rappler. “But since nakakaiba siya, it worked. It’s something that promotes friendship between the Philippines and Japan. It’s diplomacy. And it’s sustainable. It’s something unique for them. I think that’s why it catches their attention,” she said. For a brand that only started in 2021, Marjorie didn’t have high hopes yet; but what she did have was her passion for the earth. As a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and English professor in Japan, she knew her advocacy had to be woven into whatever she pursued. “During the pandemic, travel halted and disposable masks harmed marine species,” she said. “I would share good practices of other people, but I didn’t really have my own. So, that’s where I started. In 2021, during the pandemic, I began the project. At first, I didn’t promote it seriously — just to friends,” she said. Her first kimono masks used cotton, not silk, since masks had to be double-layered. She experimented with scrunchies and other hair accessories, and shortly after, decided to expand and promote more. “I wanted the masks to be sustainable and fashionable while also bringing a piece of Japan closer to Filipinos who couldn’t travel. It unexpectedly became popular,” she added. By 2024, the business expanded into tote bags, messenger bags, pouches, accessories, passport holders, and the “Kimono Filipiniana.” She joined fashion shows and community bazaars in Japan that celebrated international friendship between Filipinos and Japanese. Later, back home, she joined a university bazaar in her alma mater, University of the Philippines (UP) Los Baños, during Women’s Month in March — her first bazaar in the Philippines. The biggest one so far was ArteFino. Marjorie first fell in love with Japan in 2014, when she presented her undergraduate research at a conference. “It had always been a dream of mine to visit Japan, though it was very expensive. I sought sponsors, and thankfully, I was able to come,” she said. In 2015, UP Los Baños partnered with Nagoya University, which became her school. As a master’s student, she joined both short-term and long-term exchange programs. After her master’s, she pursued a PhD in International Development, returning in 2017. The pandemic, however, disrupted her fieldwork in the Philippines, delaying her dissertation. Around the same time, she received a job offer to become a university researcher, which she prioritized. Today, she is in her third academic year teaching as a lecturer at a university of foreign studies in Japan, invited to teach both English and SDGs in universities and high schools. But amid her quest for knowledge, at what point did Cool Kimono Crafts come in? “The first time I wore a kimono,” she recalled. It was in 2016. during her long-term exchange program. “That experience amazed me. I felt something so special wearing it and wanted to do it again. I got to know more about Japanese culture beyond anime, cars, and manga. Kimono opened another door for me,” she shared. By 2017, while working part-time teaching SDGs, her heart opened up not only to the beauty of the kimono but also to the possibility of love. “In 2018, I met my husband through a common friend, my churchmate in Japan. At that time, I wasn’t looking for a relationship. But we started hanging out as a group, we got to know each other more,” she shared. In 2019, they began dating, and in August 2023, they got married. Kimono Crafts started as — and is still — a mom-and-pop family business. Her mother, skilled in sewing, helps Marjorie bring her designs to life, while her father, who retired early, now handles logistics and driving. Being the eldest of five, Marjorie is in charge of conceptualization until the final result — vision, sketching, finance, and marketing, though social media is her weak point, she admitted. However, she shared that her mother’s job is the hardest — the sewing of kimonos is “extremely challenging because you have to preserve the flow of the kimono’s patterns,” Marjorie explained. Her sister makes accessories and also models for the brand, which boosts her confidence, Marjorie fondly shared. Her other siblings help with logistics and marketing. For now, they are still operating from their home in Laguna, where clients come for fittings, but Marjorie is hoping for a standalone boutique shop soon. Marjorie said they cater to both Japanese and Filipino buyers, making zero-waste items such as T-shirt patches and kimono earrings, priced from P850 to P1,200, which her sister makes to help with her tuition. Dresses and gowns, such as the kimono Filipiniana pieces, cost around P17,000, with both ready-to-wear and customized designs at the same price and with clients able to choose their fabric and colors. “Each kimono is unique — often hand-painted and bearing the artist’s seal — so every piece is one of a kind.” Marjorie’s relationships with trusted shops in Japan are just as important, too — this is where she sources her silk kimonos, many of which have piles of unused or unsold pieces. “Sayang, kasi bawat isa (It’s wasteful, because every piece) is a work of art. Mahal ang silk (Silk is expensive), and yet they were just being discarded.” “That’s why I love working with the Japanese. Once you establish trust with them, they will really support you. I admire their ethics — they take pride in craftsmanship and value trust. That’s something I want to bring into my own brand as well: building trust with people.” Like the Filipiniana, kimonos in Japan are now rarely worn — at weddings, funerals, tea ceremonies, or the coming of age at 20. For Marjorie, this similarity deepened her drive to bring these cultural symbols back, but in novel ways. “I was really surprised by the number of inquiries! Mostly women in their 30s and above are my customers, though some men, too,” she said. Marjorie also came up with the “bundle” idea — since each kimono is one of a kind, why not use one kimono and create six items out of it? For Marjorie, it was part of her zero-waste approach. “Each part of the kimono is used. We don’t waste anything, which is important for us. That way, we honor the material and the culture it represents.” It’s a labor of love that every member of the family contributes to — each design takes two weeks to a month to finish, all handmade, depending on where the kimono is sourced. “The Philippines and Japan are friends, after all. Through my designs, I want to honor that relationship, promote sustainability, and serve as a bridge.” Cool Kimono Crafts’ big break came in January 2024, on Marjorie’s birthday, when she staged her own fashion show in Tagaytay. “It was my first time, so, of course, we even had a same-day edit! We presented all our items — bags, kimono Filipiniana, even kimono suits. Many inquired, mostly women in their 30s, and even men,” she said in a mix of English and Filipino. The same-day edit posted on Facebook caught attention, leading to an invitation to New York Fashion Week. While she couldn’t join on short notice then, her designs still appeared on a Times Square billboard, much to her glee. But in September 2025, Marjorie’s designs finally graced the runways of New York Fashion Week and London Fashion Week — a feat she never imagined possible when she first started with face masks back in 2021. “It’s never too late to rediscover your strengths,” Marjorie said. Recognition from fashion icons like Renee Salud, who praised her designs and expressed interest in collaborating after one of her shows, keeps Marjorie raring to go but grounded. And being invited to fashion shows in New York and London this September is proof, she said, “that Filipino creativity, craftsmanship, and heart can stand on the global stage.” But why is this cultural collaboration so important to Marjorie? Aside from the business bringing her family closer, she wants to remind everyone that the Philippines and Japan are friends. “Filipinos are among the top migrant workers here, especially in Aichi Prefecture, where I live. In the Philippines, so many Japanese companies have factories in Laguna, where I’m from,” she said. “There are strong cultural and economic ties between the two countries. And through my designs, I want to honor that relationship, promote sustainability, and serve as a bridge,” Marjorie added. It’s nowhere to go but up for Marjorie, who has actually never formally studied fashion design. Her brand has been invited to bazaars organized by the Japanese Embassy, and she’s launching kimono sandals in Tokyo with a Laguna-based brand soon. “I don’t have a fashion background — I just wanted to wear fashionable clothes. But passion led me here,” she said. And with that spirit, there is sew much more in store for Cool Kimono Crafts’ handwoven future. – Rappler.com",True,true,Sew unique!

"MANILA, Philippines – The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revoked the registrations of two Discaya-owned firms for failing to disclose beneficial ownership information. In resolutions dated November 26, the SEC Enforcement and Investor Protection Department canceled the certificates of incorporation of St. Timothy Construction Corporation and St. Gerrard Construction General Contractor and Development Corporation. The two firms were also ordered to pay a penalty of P2 million each. Their directors were further disqualified from being a director, trustee, or officer of any corporation for five years. The corporate watchdog cited a Senate blue ribbon committee hearing on September 1, when Sarah Discaya admitted she was the owner and officer of St. Timothy and St. Gerrard. The SEC noted that Discaya’s involvement was not disclosed in St. Timothy’s beneficial ownership declarations from 2022 to September 2025, and St. Gerrard’s from 2022 to 2024. Discaya said in April that she divested from St. Timothy in 2018. “The failure of St. Timothy and St. Gerrard to disclose [Discaya] as their beneficial owner constituted a violation of SEC MC No. 15, Series of 2019, as amended by MC No. 10, Series of 2022, which required companies to submit their beneficial ownership information as part of their general information sheets,” the SEC explained. The corporate regulator also noted that it gave both companies 15 calendar days to explain their side, but neither complied with this. According to a report by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, the Discayas’ nine construction firms bagged 421 government projects worth P31 billion. St. Timothy and Alpha & Omega — another Discaya firm — were among the top 15 contractors of flood control projects nationwide. – Rappler.com",True,true,SEC revokes 2 Discaya firms’ registration over false ownership information,https://www.rappler.com/business/sec-revokes-registration-discaya-saint-timothy-gerrard-construction/,Rappler
"On September 30, Tuesday, the Senate committee on government corporations and public enterprises (CGPE) conducted a hearing to probe alleged malfeasance committed specifically by the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). During that particular session, it was found out that the GSIS still has to account for its investment in Alternergy Holdings Corporation which the pension fund president Jose Arnulfo “Wick” Veloso promised to immediately address. For context, Vantage Point had exposed on July 22 that Alternergy had insufficient market capitalization/financial strength and its market capitalization was way below the minimum required under GSIS investment rules. Alternergy was also heavily leveraged (i.e. high debt relative to equity) and had weak interest coverage, which made it financially risky. We also reported that the shares (preferred shares) purchased by the GSIS were not listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) at the time the agreement and payment were made. Since GSIS rules require investments in listed companies (or at least properly listed securities) for such equity exposures, this non-listing is a violation. Representatives of the Commission on Appointments (COA) validated Vantage Point’s exposé during that CGPE hearing. Recently, I found out that Stronghold Insurance Co. Inc. (SICI) — the company which provided bonds to the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) flood control projects of Pacifico “Curlee” Discaya II and Cezarah Rowena “Sarah” Cruz Discaya and where Senator Rodante Marcoleta’s wife Edna is an independent director — is also the reinsurer of the GSIS. SICI won in 2023 the Reinsurance of the GSIS Property and Engineering Combined Risk and Catastrophe Excess of Loss Treaty Service with a total coverage of P14 billion. It is an agreement aimed at safeguarding government and private properties against unforeseen events. Was this a coincidence or just one of the many absurd things happening in the Senate these days? Another absurdity is the fact that the Senate CGPE, chaired by Senator Mark Villar, is also being investigated along with his family enterprises for a far more serious transgression. Such is the sad state into which that erstwhile esteemed institution has spiraled. What began as a moment of reckoning for contractors, legislators, and bureaucrats who fattened themselves off taxpayers’ money is now turning into a circus of self-preservation and selective amnesia. The promise of accountability has been washed away by political undercurrents that seek to confuse, divide, and exhaust the public, and dampen their moral outrage. At the heart of the investigation lies a fatal flaw: the absence of independence and prosecutorial coherence. Each committee, commission, or lawmaker now seems more engaged in finger-pointing. The Senate drags in witnesses with dubious backgrounds; the House selectively names enemies while shielding allies; and the so-called “independent commission” has been gutted by resignations, political meddling, and lack of subpoena power. The result? A fragmented inquisition where every camp tries to weaponize testimony rather than uncover facts. Early on, along with majority of Filipinos, I had high hopes that justice would at last catch up with the entrenched network of fixers and contractors who for years have been turning flood-control projects into a cottage industry. But the supposed “star witnesses” — some of whom are accused masterminds themselves — have converted the hearings into a theater of convenience. They remember only what benefits them, name only those from rival factions, and plead innocence in the same breath as they confess to massive bribery. It was an execrable script written for a scenario that echoes past scandals which ended in hollow verdicts. This selective disclosure has crippled the integrity of the probe. Instead of building a timeline of graft and corruption, investigators are now chasing ghosts of allegations that shift weekly. The COA, Ombudsman, and Department of Justice (DOJ) should have been the backbone of this inquiry. Unfortunately, their findings are being drowned by political noise and media sensationalism. Perhaps the most damning proof of this circus’ collapse is how the investigators themselves have become the investigated. Senators are being accused of bias, committee chairs are facing ethics complaints, and even members of the so-called “independent” commission are being scrutinized for alleged conflicts of interest and leaks. What was supposed to be a search for truth has degenerated into a circular firing squad — a tragicomic spectacle where everyone claims to be clean, while pointing dirty fingers at each other. It’s a level of absurdity that defies logic: the accusers now demanding immunity, the enforcers pleading innocence, and the supposed watchdogs biting each other instead of the culprits. When truth commissions turn into mutual defense clubs, justice is no longer the goal — damage control is. And the public, forced to watch this farce, learns the worst lesson of all: that corruption probes in this country rarely punish the guilty, but almost always devour the honest. The credibility crisis of the Discayas, and the spectacle of senators like Marcoleta turning witnesses into martyrs, all point to a deliberate campaign to blur, not reveal, the truth. The COA’s red flags on DPWH contracts are being buried under political noise; the Ombudsman has yet to file a single solid case; and the DOJ seems paralyzed by factional pressure. Accountability cannot survive in a swamp of politicking. Unless this probe is rescued from self-interest and rebuilt on forensic evidence — not confessions traded for protection — it will produce nothing more than a deluge of wasted time and the reaffirmation that, in the Philippines, every flood finds a way to rise and justice always sinks first. In the Senate, former Senate president Francis Joseph “Chiz” Escudero is sparring with House allies of former speaker Martin Romualdez, each accusing the other of politicizing the probe. The Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) created by Malacañang — once hailed as a neutral truth-seeker — has been gutted by the resignation of Baguio Mayor Benjamin Magalong and exacerbated by the public’s growing mistrust with the ongoing ICI investigation which, according to its executive director Brian Osaka must be kept closed-doors. These troubling developments symbolized what many feared from the start: the commission was never meant to expose the full rot, only to manage the fallout. Senator Marcoleta and his bloc have gone to extraordinary lengths to vouch for their witnesses’ credibility — even suggesting witness protection — despite glaring inconsistencies and a lawyer’s denial of ever signing their affidavit. Escudero thunders against corruption in flood-control projects even as questions mount over his own alleged fund insertions in DPWH allocations. Documents flagged by auditors reportedly trace questionable items tied to local projects in Escudero’s political stronghold — projects inserted late in the budget process and now under quiet review. Meanwhile, former DPWH Secretary Mark Villar, once the architect of the Duterte administration’s “Build, Build, Build” program, is now under preliminary investigation by the DOJ for alleged irregularities tied to flood-control contracts. The DOJ’s fact-finding teams have begun examining project clusters from Villar’s tenure — many awarded to firms now tagged in COA red flags and whistleblower affidavits. If substantiated, the findings could blow open the entire system of collusion between DPWH insiders and their favored contractors. What was meant to expose rot has turned into a mirror reflecting the decay of the entire system. The irony is grotesque: senators defending tainted witnesses, whistleblowers under state protection despite self-confessed crimes, and Cabinet men feigning ignorance when their names negatively surface in audit reports. Three reasons now explain why I believe this fact-finding crusade against government corruption has turned to rubble: If nothing changes, this probe will end like all its predecessors — theatrical, wasteful, and utterly inconsequential. Billions in flood-control funds will remain unaccounted for; tainted contractors will quietly reemerge next fiscal year; and senators will resume posturing as reformists, while burying their own fingerprints under procedural mud. Opaque ICI’s investigations, the DOJ’s move against Villar, and the swirling whispers of everyone partaking of the loot all point to a single, damning truth: the investigation has turned inward, devouring itself. The COA’s red flags have been twisted by partisanship; the Ombudsman has yet to act decisively; and the DOJ is walking a tightrope between exposure and complicity. Accountability cannot bloom in poisoned soil. Unless rebuilt on hard evidence and purged of hypocrisy and self-preservation, this probe will drown — not in floodwater, but in the sludge of its own deceit. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] The Senate probe absurdities,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-senate-probe-absurdities/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – If you live in Metro Manila and frequent malls, those flashy electric vehicles you see are hard to miss. China, which made it a policy to specialize in electric vehicles (EVs), currently dominates the EV market worldwide. China-made cars were once derided for their lousy designs. Not anymore, not by a long shot. In fact, many of the Chinese EVs have surpassed Japanese and American cars when it comes to design. Ditto for Vietnam’s EVs such as VinFast. These cars look like the ones shown in fictional sci-fi movies. In suburbs, too, there are more e-trikes on the road, due partly to their affordability to the masses. Registration of two- and three-wheeled EVs has gone up from only 172 in 2023 to 43,441 in 2024, a 25,156% increase. Some of these EVs were displayed in the recently concluded 13th Philippine Electric Vehicle Summit held October 23, Thursday, to October 25, Saturday, at the SMX Convention Center in Pasay City. And the star of the summit, of course, was BYD, the world’s leader in EVs, currently being distributed in the Philippines by Ayala Corporation subsidiary ACMobility. BYD Cars Philippines country head Adam Hu said BYD has delivered 3.2 million new Energy vehicles (nEvs) worldwide as of September 2024. BYD Cars Philippines unveiled during the summit its BYD eMAX 9 DM-i, a family car which can run 1,200 kilometers on a full charge plus a full tank of gas. That covers a trip from Manila to Baguio and back without need for a refill or recharge. The 7-seater car’s interior looks like the business class of an airplane, with a pair of captain’s seats with massage feature and a 6-bottle mini-fridge. It also has middle-row tables for convenient use of laptops. Price tag? The BYD eMAX 9 DM-i premium variant sells for P2.99 million, while the advanced variant costs P2.67 million. In last year’s 12th Philippine Electric Vehicle Summit, ACMobility CEO Jaime Alfonso Zobel de Ayala talked about the company’s move to help “transform the electric vehicle landscape in the Philippines.” This year, ACMobility representatives discussed the “daunting task” of building a network of charging stations nationwide to help address car buyers’ concern about “range anxiety” or the fear of not being able to charge their vehicle due to lack of charging stations. The Asian Development Bank has provided $100 million or around P5.8 billion in co-financing with Ayala Corporation for the procurement of EV charging stations and of more EVs for commercial distribution. Though the growing presence of these EVs on the road may seem like Filipino consumers are finally adopting green vehicles, the numbers say otherwise. According to the Department of Energy, based on Land Transportation Office (LTO) data, there were only 24,286 EVs registered in the Philippines in 2024, accounting for only 0.2% of total registered vehicles. On the other hand, there were 14,595,467 conventional vehicles (gas and diesel) registered, which means 99.8% were conventional. The percentages were not that different from 2023 LTO data (see graph below from the Philippine Statistics Authority): gasoline-powered vehicles reached 11.23 million or 78.7% of the total number of registered vehicles in 2023; 3.03 million or 21.3% were diesel vehicles; 0.1% were others, i.e. Liquified Petroleum Gas (3 registered vehicles), Compressed Natural Gas (9 registered vehicles), electric (1.36 thousand registered vehicles), and hybrid (6.16 thousand registered vehicles). Admittedly, the Electric Vehicle Association of the Philippines (EVAP) said the country is still a long way from reaching a tipping point toward adopting EVs. “Unfortunately, we’re not,” said EVAP president Edmund Araga, when asked recently by the ABS-CBN News Channel’s Market Edge if the Philippine EV market had reached “inflection point.” But Araga prefers to look at the glass half-full than half-empty. He said that around 29,000 EVs were registered from January to June 2025, a 100% increase from the number of EVs registered from 2013 to 2024. An October 2024 EVAP report said there’s been an 8.4% annual average growth in market sales of EVs from 2013 to 2023. Araga said many car buyers are “very engaged” in switching to hybrids and EVs, and that the interest extends to companies that are shifting from internal combustion engines (ICEs) to electrified vehicles for their trucks and buses. Araga highlighted the need for local government units (LGUs) to push the EV industry in order to convince more consumers to adopt EVs.

"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) set the record straight amid online claims surrounding the market capitalization (MCAP) lost since December 2024. In a statement, the local bourse clarified that domestic MCAP was only down P273 billion or 1.88% from December 2024 to October 2025. The PSE issued the clarification after what it described as a “pseudo-expert” on the stock market falsely claimed that the local bourse lost P5 trillion during that period. “Unfortunately, this fake news was irresponsibly published on the same day and reposted the following day in an online tabloid that is known for prioritizing sensationalism that will generate clicks and engagements over providing news that have been fact-checked or verified,” the PSE said. Market capitalization, also known as market cap, is the total value of the outstanding shares that is traded on the stock market. The PSE explained that it tracks two types of market cap: total and domestic. Domestic MCAP includes Philippine firms that are primarily listed in the PSE. On the other hand, total market cap includes the foreign companies that are also listed with the local bourse: Sun Life Financial, Inc. (SLF), Del Monte Pacific Ltd. (DELM), and Manulife Financial Corporation (MFC). “Since only less than 1% of the outstanding shares of MFC and SLF and less than 5% of DELM are lodged for trading in the PSE, PSE uses domestic MCAP data as the reference number since it more accurately captures the performance of the Philippine stock market,” the PSE said. The local bourse further likened comparing domestic and total MCAP to comparing apples to oranges. “Deliberately comparing apples to oranges by comparing Domestic MCAP to Total MCAP is dishonest, if not malicious, and is clearly meant to provoke investors to lose confidence in the Philippine capital market and destabilize the economy,” the PSE said. The PSE’s clarification also comes after Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chief Francis Lim fell victim to a fake industry report that claimed the stock market lost P1.7 trillion in MCAP in August due to falling investor confidence amid the controversies surrounding anomalous flood control projects. – Rappler.com",True,true,"PSE: Domestic market cap only down P273 billion, not P5 trillion",https://www.rappler.com/business/pse-clarifies-domestic-market-capitalization-october-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The National Privacy Commission (NPC) on Thursday, October 30, said it concluded its investigation into reports of a possible data leak involving GCash and found “no sufficient basis to conclude that a personal data breach occurred within G-Xchange, Inc.

"Claim: Former president Rodrigo Duterte has been released from the custody of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and is set to spend Christmas in the Philippines. Why we fact-checked this: The YouTube video containing the claim has 37,000 views, 2,900 likes, and 444 comments as of writing. It was uploaded on a YouTube channel claiming to be a news outlet, which has 168,000 subscribers. The video claims that Duterte’s release has been confirmed and that he will spend Christmas in the Philippines. It also alleges that the media withheld this information from the public and asserts that the Supreme Court has already issued an ultimatum for his release. The title in the video states: “Sa wakas! Kumpirmado na, tatay Digong makakalaya na? Supreme Court matinding utos, bring FPRRD home!“ (Finally! It’s confirmed! Father Digong will be freed! The Supreme Court has issued a strong order to bring him home!) The facts: Duterte has not been released by the ICC. He remains in detention at the ICC Detention Centre in Scheveningen Prison, The Hague, after the ICC Appeals Chamber unanimously denied his request for interim release on November 28, 2025. There are no credible reports confirming his release because no such release has occurred. Claims that the Philippine Supreme Court has issued an “ultimatum” for his release are also false as Philippine courts have no jurisdiction over ICC custody or proceedings and cannot order, compel, or interfere with ICC detention decisions. As an “independent and impartial judicial institution” established under the Rome Statute, the ICC’s detention orders cannot be overturned or interfered with by any domestic body. The ICC has repeatedly stated that it will continue its work “independently and impartially, undeterred by external pressure,” and that all decisions are governed solely by the Rome Statute. Jurisdiction issues: The ICC has asked the prosecution and victims’ lawyers to provide additional explanations on its jurisdiction over Duterte in the ongoing crimes against humanity case. In a December 16, 2025 order, the Appeals Chamber directed the parties to submit “additional observations” by January 16, focusing on how Articles 12(2), 13(c), and 127 of the Rome Statute interact. Article 12 sets the preconditions for the ICC’s exercise of jurisdiction, Article 13 defines when the court may assert jurisdiction, and Article 127 outlines a state’s continuing obligations even after leaving the ICC. The defense must submit its response by January 23, five working days after the other parties’ deadline. This directive follows the defense’s November 14 appeal challenging the court’s jurisdiction, which comes after the Pre-Trial Chamber’s October 23 ruling affirming the ICC’s authority to prosecute and detain Duterte. – Marjuice Destinado/Rappler.com Marjuice Destinado is a senior political science student at Cebu Normal University and an alumna of the Aries Rufo Journalism Fellowship of Rappler for 2025.

"The Lucio Co Group’s full-control acquisition of PrimeWater marks a pivotal consolidation in the Philippine water sector, underscoring how essential utilities have become strategic, defensive assets for large conglomerates. By bringing one of the country’s largest private water portfolios under Crystal Bridges Holding Corporation, the deal signals a shift toward scale, balance-sheet strength, and long-term capital commitment in a sector strained by aging infrastructure, climate risk, and fragmented ownership. While the transaction is legally sound despite the undisclosed purchase price, it sharpens investor and regulatory focus on governance, transparency, and the treatment of public water district partners whose assets and consumers are directly affected by any change in control. Beyond market impact, the acquisition places responsibility squarely on Crystal Bridges to address PrimeWater’s long-standing operational and consumer service challenges. Service reliability, non-revenue water, billing disputes, and wastewater compliance are not peripheral issues but core financial and reputational risks. Lucio Co’s credibility and capital discipline give it the opportunity to reset standards through visible investment, clearer performance benchmarks, and greater disclosure — turning PrimeWater from a politically sensitive operator into a predictable, accountable utility. Ultimately, the success of the deal will be judged, not by consolidation alone, but by whether scale is translated into better service, restored trust, and sustainable returns in one of the country’s most critical sectors. The Lucio Co Group’s buyout of PrimeWater Infrastructure Corporation (PrimeWater) from the Villar family is being brandied as a straightforward consolidation play in a capital-hungry sector. But Vantage Point sees it as something more significant. It reshapes power dynamics in the Philippine water industry, exposes lingering governance fault lines, and forces a reckoning on a question that utilities cannot escape forever: whether scale and capital alone can repair trust once consumers have lost it. PrimeWater is not a marginal asset. It operates one of the country’s largest private water portfolios, spanning joint ventures with local water districts, bulk water supply, septage, and wastewater management across fast-growing urban and provincial areas. Folding that platform into Crystal Bridges, the Lucio Co Group’s investment vehicle, effectively transfers control of a critical slice of the country’s water infrastructure to one of the Philippines’ most disciplined capital allocators. For the market, the signal is unmistakable. Regulated utilities, once dismissed as slow and politically messy, are now being treated as core defensive assets, prized for long-duration cash flows in an economy where volatility is the norm rather than the exception. This transaction reinforces a broader consolidation trend. Water infrastructure is becoming too capital-intensive, too regulated, and too exposed to climate stress for fragmented ownership structures to survive. Operators need balance sheets that can absorb pipe rehabilitation, wastewater compliance, and non-revenue water losses without lurching from one tariff petition to the next. From that perspective, the entry of Lucio Co into full control of PrimeWater may ultimately strengthen the sector by forcing weaker operators and underfunded water districts to confront the true cost of service delivery. Yet markets do not price infrastructure on assets alone. They price governance, transparency, and execution risk. And this is where the PrimeWater deal becomes more complicated. The acquisition price was not disclosed. In a purely private transaction, that omission is not, by itself, illegal. Philippine law does not compel private companies to publish valuation details unless they are publicly traded or listed on the stock exchange, or if the disclosure directly impacts public shareholders. But legality is not the same as adequacy. PrimeWater’s business model is deeply intertwined with public assets through water district joint ventures that are subject to state audit and regulatory oversight. Any change in control that affects capital structure, risk allocation, or investment commitments reverberates beyond shareholders and into the public sphere. This is where governance questions begin to surface. If PrimeWater carried significant related-party funding, guarantees, or contingent liabilities under its previous ownership, regulators will want to know how those exposures are being unwound — or whether they are simply being transferred to a new sponsor with deeper pockets. (READ: White flag? Why the Villars want out of PrimeWater) If listed entities related to Villar or Co were indirectly involved through loans, guarantees, or receivables, disclosure obligations do not vanish simply because the transaction headline says “private.” The real test will be whether the transaction leaves behind clean financial boundaries or merely shifts complexity out of sight. For Crystal Bridges, the strategic rationale is clear, but the operational inheritance is less forgiving. PrimeWater has faced sustained consumer complaints over service reliability, billing disputes, and wastewater compliance. These are not public-relations problems; they are balance-sheet issues waiting to happen. Chronic underinvestment in maintenance shows up first as leaks and service interruptions, then later as emergency capital expenditure (CapEx), regulatory penalties, or political backlash. Non-revenue water is not just water lost to leaks—it is revenue lost to inefficiency, often masked by accounting profits that do not translate into cash. This is where Lucio Co’s reputation becomes an asset, if it is deployed deliberately. Crystal Bridges can address PrimeWater’s consumer problems only by breaking with the legacy playbook that treats water districts as captive partners rather than stakeholders. The most immediate fix is capital discipline: ring-fenced funding for pipe rehabilitation, wastewater upgrades, and metering modernization that is visibly tied to service improvements, not just expansion announcements. Consumers do not experience EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). They experience pressure, continuity, and billing accuracy. Equally important is governance at the operating level. PrimeWater’s joint ventures need clearer performance metrics, transparent tariff logic, and predictable dispute-resolution mechanisms. Crystal Bridges has the institutional credibility to impose standardized service benchmarks across regions, replacing the patchwork approach that has fueled uneven performance and public frustration. Doing so would not only reduce regulatory risk, but also stabilize cash flows through the alignment of consumer trust with revenue sustainability. The acquisition also offers an opportunity to reset disclosure norms. Even if not legally required, greater transparency around CapEx commitments, service targets, and financial health would send a powerful signal to regulators and water districts alike. (READ: PrimeWater probe covers ‘possible conflict’ of DPWH under Mark Villar) In essential utilities, opacity breeds suspicion, and suspicion eventually attracts intervention. Lucio Co’s long-term advantage lies in making PrimeWater boring in the best possible way: predictable, compliant, and visibly accountable. The market impact of this deal therefore is not confined to ownership charts. It raises the bar for how private capital participates in public-facing utilities. If Crystal Bridges succeeds, it could accelerate consolidation, while restoring confidence that private operators can deliver both returns and reliability.

"The Global Minimum Tax is a tax system developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the G20 countries (OECD/G20) under its Pillar 2, or the Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (“GloBE Rules”). It compels big multinational corporations — those with annual revenues exceeding €750 million — to pay a minimum 15% corporate tax rate, regardless of their location of operation. This aims to prevent companies from tax avoidance by relocating profits to nations with no or low tax rates or Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). Currently, more than 147 countries, including the Philippines, have joined the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, which includes the implementation of the GMT. Implementing the Global Minimum Tax in the Philippines is advantageous. It can increase government revenues by ensuring that big multinational corporations (MNCs) pay their fair share of tax, rather than transferring profits to tax havens. For the Philippines, the implementation of GMT presents a timely opportunity to strengthen its tax system and safeguard domestic revenues. Many MNCs operating in the Philippines currently benefit from generous tax incentives; however, with the proposed introduction of the Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT) and the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR), the government aims to ensure that these MNCs pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, aligning with global standards and safeguarding domestic tax revenues. The first mechanism, Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT), enables the Philippine government to collect the difference between the actual tax paid and the 15% minimum rate for MNCs with subsidiaries in the Philippines. The QDMTT mechanism ensures that any tax revenue due stays within the country, rather than being redirected to foreign jurisdictions. The second mechanism is the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR), which empowers the home country of the MNCs to impose a top-up tax on the income of its foreign subsidiaries when that income is taxed below the agreed global minimum rate. Adopting the GMT may also assist the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) in the fight against tax evasion and demonstrate the Philippines’ dedication to equitable taxation by guaranteeing that MNCs and domestic firms have an equal footing in competition and defending local businesses. Without the GMT, the Philippines runs the risk of losing tax revenue to other countries that may impose top-up taxes on locally sourced income. Previously, under the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act and the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises to Maximize Opportunities for Reinvigorating the Economy Act (CREATE MORE), companies operating in the Philippines — especially multinational corporations — have benefited from preferential tax incentives such as Income Tax Holidays (ITH) lasting up to 4 to 7 years of tax exemption, depending on location and industry, and options like the Special Corporate Income Tax (SCIT) at a reduced rate of 5% on gross income or the Enhanced Deduction Regime (EDR), allowing companies to claim deductions on qualifying expenses. These incentives provide temporary tax exemptions or reduced tax rates, helping businesses lower their overall tax burden. However, the introduction of the Global Minimum Tax (GMT) under the OECD’s BEPS initiative is set to reshape the tax incentive landscape in the Philippines. If the effective tax rate in the Philippines falls below the 15% threshold due to incentives such as ITH or SCIT (5%), these companies could face additional taxes in other jurisdictions through mechanisms such as the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) or the Undertaxed Profit Rules (UTPR). This means that incentives that currently reduce tax rates well below 15% may no longer provide a net tax advantage for multinational corporations. This shift necessitates a reassessment of the country’s tax incentive policies. Instead of relying heavily on steep tax rate reductions — such as the current 5% SCIT rate or full exemption during ITH — incentives may need to focus more on performance-based or activity-specific rewards, such as grants tied to job creation, infrastructure investments, or research and development. This approach not only aligns with global tax standards but also encourages investments that contribute to sustainable economic growth. Furthermore, the Enhanced Deduction Regime (EDR), which allows deductions linked to qualifying activities at up to 150% of the actual expenses, reflects a move toward more substance-driven incentives rather than pure tax rate cuts. These reforms come alongside a broader corporate tax reduction — from a previous standard rate of 30%, among the highest in ASEAN, to the current 25%. While this reduction enhances competitiveness, the GMT’s 15% minimum effective tax rate challenges the attractiveness of incentives that push the effective tax rate below this threshold, as they risk triggering top-up taxes abroad. Therefore, the Philippines will likely need to combine its tax reforms with other strategies, such as improving infrastructure, regulatory ease, and workforce skills, to maintain its appeal to foreign investors in a global tax environment increasingly focused on transparency and fairness. Although the Philippines joined the Inclusive Framework in November 2023, it has not yet enacted legislation to operationalize GMT rules domestically. Meanwhile, neighboring countries like Vietnam, Singapore, and Thailand are already advancing their GMT policies, giving them a competitive edge in capturing and retaining tax revenues from global corporations. Delay in implementation could put the Philippines at a disadvantage — not only in terms of lost revenue but also in its ability to shape global tax policy and investment trends in the region. The global minimum tax represents a bold step toward ending aggressive tax avoidance schemes and ensuring that large multinational corporations contribute their fair share to the economies in which they operate. For the Philippines, it is more than just a revenue tool, it is a strategic move toward fiscal sustainability, fair competition, and global cooperation. By adopting and implementing the GMT, the Philippines can protect its tax base, enhance its credibility on the world stage, and build a more equitable economic future for both domestic businesses and Filipino citizens. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Ask the Tax Whiz] The Global Minimum Tax and its impact on the Philippines,https://www.rappler.com/business/ask-the-tax-whiz-global-minimum-impact-philippines/,Rappler
"Newly surfaced records obtained by Vantage Point expose how GSIS trustees, Evelina Escudero, Merceditas Gutierrez and Rita Riddle, helped usher in a dubious ₱2-billion IT deal with DBP Data Center Inc. (DCI) — a firm whose own executives later admitted to have lacked the capability in building the public sector’s social insurance institution’s core systems. What began as a push for “modernization” now reeks of impropriety and influence-peddling within a pension fund in which these ladies claim to have been mismanaged. When guardians of the public trust start behaving like brokers, institutions crumble from within. The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), already bruised by allegations of governance lapses and flood-control controversies, now finds itself entangled in another scandal — this time involving a ₱2-billion computerization deal pushed by trustees Evelina Escudero and Rita Riddle and allegedly backed by Merceditas Gutierrez. Gutierrez and Riddle resigned from the GSIS board last month. What makes this case galling is not just the staggering amount or the timing — coming as GSIS struggles to rebuild credibility — but the audacity with which key trustees introduced and advanced a project pitched by a company that ultimately confessed it couldn’t deliver what it was promising. On September 2, 2025, representatives from DBP Data Center Incorporated (DCI) — Business Development Head Jose Enrique Singson, Project Lead Apolonia Salud Jr., and domain experts Ma. Isabel Domingo and Dennis Dizon — met with the GSIS Board of Trustees to present their information technology (IT) services. That meeting alone raised eyebrows. DCI was no mere vendor — it was a government-owned and -controlled corporation (GOCC) under the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). Yet its delegation was allowed to pitch directly to the GSIS board, a move that blurred procurement lines and created a cozy dynamic between trustees and a potential contractor. Just two weeks later, on September 15, 2025, during the Legal Oversight Committee meeting, trustees proposed that GSIS and DCI execute a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) — fast-tracked through a board referendum which bypassed a full deliberation. For an institution managing billions in pension assets, such haste is indefensible. The trustees weren’t merely entertaining a presentation; they were laying the groundwork for a partnership that would later balloon into a ₱2-billion IT “modernization” project. Thankfully, not everyone was asleep at the switch. Vantage Point learned that on September 29, 2025, GSIS President and General Manager Jose Arnulfo “Wick” Veloso intervened during the Risk Oversight Committee meeting, requesting that approval of the MOU be deferred. Veloso, who had not attended the earlier presentations, questioned why such a significant deal had progressed without his knowledge. He requested a direct meeting with DCI’s top executives — President and Chief Executive Officer Michielson Luakian and Chief Operating Officer Jose Carmelo Porciuncula — to better understand their proposal. The meeting was scheduled for October 9, 2025. What unfolded there should have killed the deal permanently. During that October meeting, DCI executives revealed more than they intended. They described their company as a “40-year-old startup” offering IT support and staff augmentation services to various government agencies and private clients. When asked if they developed the core systems of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), they admitted they did not — DBP handled its own IT infrastructure. DCI merely provided manpower support “when needed.” When pressed further about their readiness to take on GSIS’s modernization, DCI’s own president conceded that “GSIS is significantly more advanced in IT than most government-owned or -controlled corporations,” and that DCI “does not have the capability to undertake the development of GSIS’s core systems.” The clincher came when Luakian stated DCI would formally withdraw its interest to avoid further delays in GSIS’s internal plans. If this were a private-sector board, the next step would be an investigation into how such a weak proposal ever made it to board-level presentation. In GSIS, however, it became another footnote in a long saga of institutional decay. After the meeting, Veloso reportedly asked who had introduced DCI to GSIS. The answer came from Vice President and Chief Information Security/Data Protection Officer Jonathan Pineda: it was trustees Riddle and Escudero. It was later learned that the deal had the backing of Gutierrez. Pineda disclosed that during the September 2 Risk Oversight Committee meeting, Riddle and Escudero had suggested that GSIS’s IT systems be “reviewed and audited by DCI,” and that an MOU be signed to facilitate an “agency-to-agency procurement.” That phrase — agency-to-agency procurement — is key. Such arrangements between government entities are exempt from public bidding under Republic Act 9184, the Government Procurement Reform Act. In theory, agency-to-agency procurements promote efficiency. In practice, they create a loophole: a way to move massive sums without competitive scrutiny. It’s not modernization; it’s maneuvering. The revelations did not stop there. Upon background check, Vantage Point discovered that DCI President Luakian — the same man who had just admitted lack of IT expertise — was previously business development head of M.E. Sicat Construction Incorporated, a DPWH contractor involved in public works projects. So, the man behind a proposed ₱2-billion IT deal for GSIS came from the same world of construction contracting now tainted by flood-control scandals. To call that a conflict of interest would be an understatement — it is a revolving door between two sectors notorious for cost overruns and patronage politics. Trustees Riddle, Escudero, and Gutierrez appear to have facilitated, endorsed, or at best tolerated a process that flirted dangerously with impropriety. Gutierrez, who recently resigned from the GSIS board and carries her own history of ethical baggage as former Philippine justice secretary and Ombudsman — should have been the first to demand due diligence. Their actions betray a disturbing inversion of duty: trustees meant to guard public funds became the very conduits for questionable partnerships. At a time when GSIS is under intense scrutiny for investment losses — which the three ladies, along with other signatories, alleged procurement opacity — and political entanglements, the last thing the institution needs is another scandal cloaked in the language of “digital transformation.” The DCI episode is symptomatic of a larger sickness in public finance: the weaponization of “modernization.” Every time an agency is caught in a scandal, it announces a grand reform project — usually IT-related, often multimillion-peso, or in this case multibillion-peso, worth. These projects rarely fix the core problem. They merely digitize dysfunction. Without ethical leadership, every system — no matter how advanced — becomes another conduit for graft. What must happen now GSIS doesn’t need a ₱2-billion IT overhaul. It needs an ethical reboot. Until the board cleans its ranks, no system — digital or human — can restore the public’s trust. Escudero, Gutierrez, and Riddle’s fingerprints on the DCI affair show that the danger to GSIS is not technological inadequacy, but moral decay. When trustees act like sales agents and former contractors pose as technological innovators, modernization becomes just another scam in bureaucratic clothing. If GSIS cannot fix that, it won’t need a new system; it will need a rescue. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] The DCI-GSIS affair: A billion-peso blunder,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-dbp-dci-gsis-affair-billion-peso-blunder/,Rappler

"MANILA, Philippines – Chinese fast-food restaurant chain Chowking is reinventing itself in a pivot to the Philippines’ young demographic. Chowking, now 40 years old, has been rolling out new concept stores that it hopes can further entice the GenZ market or those who were not yet born when ChowKing was first established by its founder, Robert Fung Kuan, in 1985. The Jollibee Group acquired Chowking in 2000. How best to get more GenZs to dine in a legacy fast-food brand? One tack is to make the stores Instagrammable. The strategy may not be obvious to those who live in Metro Manila, since most of the concept stores are in the provinces. Take the case of the newly opened Chowking in SM City La Union in the Philippines’ surfing capital in the north. The store’s interior is much brighter than Chowking’s older stores. While older stores have lots of white and some brown colors, the new concept stores have orange, yellow, red as the dominant colors. Various studies have found that the colors orange, yellow, and red help boost appetite. “We’ve just launched our new concept store, and we’re very encouraged by the reception,” Ken Lingan, president of Chowking told ABS-CBN News Channel’s business show Market Edge on October 23. “The thing we’re concerned about is: how does it appeal to the GenZ market. And the actual word we’ve been hearing is, Instagrammable.” The new stores have modern art designs that could make people, young and old, post photos of them dining in Chowking — and get more people to visit. “It’s not just about the food. We want to really elevate the whole experience our consumers have in our stores,” Lingan said. Other outlets with the new concept are: Chowking Nepomall in Angeles City, Pampanga; Chowking SM Marilao, Bulacan; Chowking Buhay na Tubig, Imus City, Cavite; Chowking Robinsons Dumaguete, Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental; and Chowking Batangas Passenger Terminal, Santa Clara, Batangas City. Another strategy to get more young customers? Offer them sugary drinks. More Chowking stores now have Milksha counters. This Taiwanese bubble tea brand is popular among young consumers. Jollibee bought a majority stake in the company behind Milksha in November 2021. Milksha drinks are being paired with Chowking favorites like its top-selling Chao Fan rice dish. As part of its 40th anniversary celebration, Chowking recently held its first-ever Chow Fun Run at the Mall of Asia grounds in Pasay City, a community engagement that helps build real connections with the youth. A post shared by Chowking 超群 (@chowkingph) Chowking has also added more self-order kiosks that young people, unlike many seniors, find easy to use. Lingan said close to half of Chowking’s network of 600 stores already have self-order kiosks. “We believe this adds convenience to our consumers,” he said. Chowking is also reinventing itself in response to a change in consumer behavior brought about partly by the COVID-19 pandemic, with more people working from and eating at home. Whereas dine-in made up the bulk of Chowking’s sales pre-pandemic, Chowking is seeing more consumers turn to take-outs and deliveries post-pandemic. “We now see the emergence of off-premise, and we continue to expand our drive-thru channels and delivery,” said Lingan. “It [drive-thru] used to be less than 10% of our business…. Now, our off-premise channels contribute to close to half our business.” In the next three to five years, Lingan said “close to 50%” of Chowking’s network will have drive-thrus. These are all part of Chowking’s contribution to making the Jollibee Group one of the top 5 food companies in the world. Chowking is also present in six countries outside the Philippines, mainly in the Middle East with 35 stores and 15 in the US, as of end 2024. – Rappler.com",True,true,Chowking reinvents: How this 40-year-old fast-food is pivoting to the GenZ market,https://www.rappler.com/business/chowking-pivot-gen-z-market/,Rappler
"Our furry friends have always been with us — wagging their tails once they hear your footsteps, purring whenever they’re being petted, asking for a belly rub before they sleep, or simply staying by your side when you’re sad or alone. Nowadays, they’re not just simple companions. They’re being treated as actual children with how pampered they are — dressed in clothes and diapers and even being mistaken as babies while sitting in their strollers. The pet and owner attachment is unbreakable, which is why it’s so hard knowing their precious time in the world is always too short. And with this, we would also want to honor them by bidding them a respectful goodbye as they cross the rainbow bridge. Across the world, there are services and traditions done to furr-ever remember these animals who once filled our lives with joy. In the Philippines, several companies offer pet memorial services including burial, traditional cremation, and aquamation. A pet memorial service allows pet owners to have their own time to say goodbye, similar to how it’s done for humans. It’s where pets are laid out for viewing. There’s also an option for a short chapel viewing. Through heat, cremation turns the pet’s remains into ashes, and are given to pet owners. On the other hand, aquamation is the water-based alternative to the traditional fire cremation, and a more eco-friendly way. Memorial packages often include a photobox urn, the pet’s paw prints, and even a portion of their fur and nails. For a meaningful keepsake, some also offer to store the fur in a piece of jewelry so owners can carry a part of their pets with them. Some local government units also provide pet memorial services. In Cainta, Rizal, cremation services are free for residents. The Muntinlupa city government also offers a cremation package with a P500-discount for those who reside in the area. There are also other public spaces in Metro Manila that serve as pet cemeteries, such as the Barangay Fortune Pet Memorial Garden in Marikina City. There’s also a pet burial service available at the Manila South Cemetery. Disney’s Coco (2017) introduced us to Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), a Mexican holiday that honors deceased loved ones. In Mexico, the Day of the Dead for pets is observed every October 27. Ofrendas (offerings) are set up on an altar, which include important elements like the pet’s photo, an arch made of flower or reeds, and a papel picado (traditional perforated paper). Other items included are salt, sugar skull, candles, flowers, food, and water. A post shared by Chloe Chung + MisTricks (@mistricks) To make it more personal, symbols of the pets are also placed on the altar such as their favorite items like toys, treats, or collar, as well as their urns. While this is a practice that’s common in Mexico, this is also adapted by fur parents from other countries too. Japan’s affection for pets is extraordinary. According to Japan Today, the number of pets has surpassed the number of children in their country! With this, it’s no surprise that countless cemeteries and temples in Japan offer spaces for pet mourning and remembrance, helping fur parents to mourn and express their love and gratitude after their companions have passed. Most practices are grounded in Buddhist ideas that view animals as beings whose spirits, like those of humans, also deserve guidance in the afterlife. A post shared by Calum McSwiggan (@calummcswiggan) One example is Unrinji Temple in Yamaguchi Prefecture. Here, visitors can write and send letters to a special postbox dedicated to departed pets. While it’s also called Cat Temple, it welcomes all kinds of animals, offering memorial services, prayers, and rituals. Beyond the temple grounds, Japan also has another form of remembrance at Shibuya Station. A statue of Hachiko, the loyal Akita dog that inspired the 2009 film of the same name, was built and became well-known among locals and tourists because of his heartwarming story. Visitors often touch the statue’s legs as a sign of respect. April 8 is Hachiko Day, a ceremony where flowers and speeches are offered to honor his loyalty. Nepal has a special day to celebrate dogs: Kukur Tihar or Day of the Dogs, which falls around October or November. According to The Seattle Times, dogs are worshiped with the belief that they are the messengers of Yamraj, the Hindu God of Death. Both living and deceased dogs are honored during the festival. It is their way to recognize their loyalty, protection, and companionship. It’s part of Tihar, a Hindu festival that goes on for five days. During the second day, these four-legged pets are bathed, draped with flower garlands around their necks, and marked with a tilaka on their foreheads as part of the ceremony. – Rappler.com Alessandria Corral is a Rappler intern and a Bachelor of Arts in Speech Communication student at the University of the Philippines Diliman.",True,true,How do different countries honor pets as they cross over to the rainbow bridge?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/ways-different-countries-honor-dead-pets/,Rappler

"Asian airlines scrambled on Saturday, November 29, to fix a software glitch on their Airbus A320 jets as a sweeping recall by the European planemaker grounded aircraft across the region after disrupting travel in the US during the busiest weekend of the year. The recall of 6,000 planes covers more than half of Airbus’ global A320 family fleet, the backbone of Asian short-haul aviation, particularly in China and India where economic growth has brought millions of new travelers into the skies. Regulators around the world followed the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in directing their carriers to remedy the A320 software problem before resuming flights. The Airbus recall, issued to 350 operators around the world, appears to be one of the biggest in its 55-year history and comes weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered model. The US Federal Aviation Administration told carriers to replace or modify software that controls the elevators and ailerons on A319, A320 and A321 airplanes. India’s aviation regulator said 338 Airbus aircraft in the country were affected by the glitch but said the software reset will be completed by Sunday, November 30. The country’s largest airline, IndiGo, has completed the software reset on 143 out of 200 aircraft, the regulator said. Air India, which has 113 impacted aircraft, has completed the reset on 42 aircraft. Both airlines warned of delays on Saturday. “There isn’t any major impact on schedule integrity across our network,” Air India posted on X. “However, some of our flights may be slightly delayed or rescheduled.” Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration instructed airlines to conduct inspections and maintenance. It estimates that around two-thirds of the 67 A320 and A321 aircraft operated by the island’s carriers are affected. The Civil Aviation Authority of Macao said it had asked Air Macau to address the issue, including rescheduling flights to minimize any disruption to passengers. ANA Holdings, Japan’s biggest airline, cancelled 65 flights on Saturday and warned of more disruption on Sunday. ANA and its affiliates, such as Peach Aviation, operate the most Airbus A320 jets in Japan. Its chief rival, Japan Airlines, has a mostly Boeing fleet and does not fly the A320. Nationwide, 95 flights were cancelled, according to public broadcaster NHK. Globally, there are about 11,300 of the single-aisle jets in service, including 6,440 of the core A320. The fix mainly involves reverting to earlier software, and although relatively simple, it must be completed before the planes can fly again. Jetstar, the budget carrier of Australia’s flag carrier Qantas, said some of its flights would be affected by the recall. The Australian Broadcasting Corp reported significant delays at Melbourne airport. South Korea’s Asiana Airlines said it does not expect any significant disruptions to its flight schedule, with only 17 of its aircraft affected by the recall. Its domestic rival, Korean Air, said it was working to get 10 of its jets back into service. South Korea’s Transport Ministry said upgrades to 42 aircraft there were expected to be completed by Sunday morning. Hong Kong budget carrier HK Express said it had upgraded more than half its affected aircraft and that flight operations were normal. The world’s largest A320 operator, American Airlines, said 340 of its 480 A320 aircraft needed the fix, most of which it expected to complete by Saturday. US carriers American, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, and United Airlines are among the world’s 10 biggest A320-family operators. Other airlines that said they would do the repairs include Germany’s Lufthansa, and Britain-based easyJet. Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70% of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8. Industry sources said a sharp loss of altitude on a JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on October 30, that injured several passengers had triggered the Airbus recall. – Rappler.com",True,true,Airbus A320 recall disrupts Asian travel as carriers scramble to patch software,https://www.rappler.com/business/airbus-issues-major-a320-recall-november-28-2025/,Rappler
"CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – Jesuit priest Antonio Moreno, former president of Ateneo de Zamboanga University and provincial superior of the Philippine Jesuit Community, invites readers into a personal meditation on leadership in his new book, Imperfect Leadership (A Jesuit Reflects on His Journey). The book, published by Xavier University Press in collaboration with the Jesuit Conference of Asia Pacific (JPAC), will be launched in Cagayan de Oro on Friday, November 7. “I offer this book with the hope that readers’ experiences may intersect with mine in some aspects of the story, for as Kierkegaard puts it, by reflecting on our past, we may draw some lessons for the future,” Father Moreno said. In this 244-page reflection, Moreno frames leadership not as flawless execution or public acclaim but as accompaniment, discernment, and service marked by humility and grace. Through the lens of his own Jesuit formation and career, he highlights how leadership is both human and spiritual, shaped by mentors, family, and formative experiences. Moreno recounts the influence of his father, Rodolfo, along with other key figures like Rafael Cecilio, and other Jesuits – Father Antonio “Derps” Cuna and Father Pedro Arrupe – whose examples of care, courage, and ethical leadership helped define his path. His successor at JPAC, Father Primitivo Viray Jr., praises Moreno’s style as “unassuming and gentle… marked by integrity, competence, and deep compassion.” Similarly, Father Mars Tan, president of the Jesuit-run Xavier University-Ateneo de Cagayan, describes Moreno’s book as “neither a manual nor a memoir – it is a pilgrimage… marked not by perfection but by profound learning, surprising turns, and the grace that comes through vulnerability.” The narrative does, however, demand some familiarity with Jesuit philosophy and Catholic leadership structures. Concepts like the Faith-Justice-Dialogue Thrust, Growing in Vocation, and synodality may be challenging for readers outside the Church. Yet, Moreno’s reflections on synodal leadership – “emphasizing communion, participation, and mission… foster[ing] mutual collaboration” and bearing hope amid a fractured world – resonate beyond ecclesiastical circles. Imperfect Leadership traces Moreno’s evolution from a reserved individual to a global-minded leader, showing moments of vulnerability, humility, and unexpected responsibility. Central to his approach is availability, trusting in the spirit (“willingness to be led”), and sheer self-giving to be placed “totally in His hands,” despite the imperfections. “Although there are moments when friends laud my efforts and tend to overrate me as a leader, I see myself only as someone whose main assets are simply availability, a willingness to be led, openness to surprises, and the courage to take risks and make difficult decisions when needed. Nothing more,” he said. For readers seeking leadership lessons rooted in humanity, reflection, and ethical service, Moreno’s book is a thoughtful guide. Its honesty about imperfection, combined with the richness of lived experience, offers inspiration for leaders across vocations, faiths, and walks of life. – Rappler.com",True,true,‘Imperfect Leadership’: A Jesuit’s humble reflection on service and guidance,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/imperfect-leadership-jesuit-antonio-moreno-book-reflection/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Lopez-led ABS-CBN Corporation has settled its financial dispute with Manny V. Pangilinan’s (MVP) TV5 and Mediaquest and signed a licensing deal with Manny Villar’s ALLTV. In a disclosure late Wednesday, December 17, the former broadcast giant said it has acceded to TV5’s notice terminating its content agreement effective January 2, 2026. The content deal allowed TV5 to air ABS-CBN shows on the Kapatid channel’s prime time slots on weekdays and on weekends with the two platforms sharing ad revenues. ABS-CBN also said that it has “formally tendered payments” to the MVP Group that settles a reported nearly P1 billion in delayed payments of TV5’s revenue share from the content deal. The Kapatid Channel earlier said the delay “had affected TV5’s ability to settle its own obligations.” ABS-CBN, which is heavily indebted, had disputed the reported P950 million delayed payments to TV5 as of October 2025, although it did not provide details on what it was contesting. In the same disclosure, ABS-CBN said it has signed a licensing agreement with Villar’s Advanced Media Broadcasting System (AMBS), owner and operator of ALLTV Network, on the airing of ABS-CBN’s Kapamilya Channel on ALLTV starting January 2. “Starting on this date, ALLTV audiences will be able to watch their favorite ABS-CBN shows like FPJ’s Batang Quiapo, Roja, What Lies Beneath, It’s Showtime, ASAP, TV Patrol, and more. Prime ABS-CBN programs will continue to be available on A2Z, with It’s Showtime and Pinoy Big Brother Celebrity Collab 2.0 airing on GMA,” ABS-CBN said. ALLTV operates ABS-CBN’s former free TV Channel 2 (analog) in Mega Manila, which the Lopezes lost after the Rodrigo Duterte administration rejected the broadcast renewal in 2020. Then-congresswoman and now Senator Camille Villar was among those who voted against a new franchise for ABS-CBN. ABS-CBN signed a content deal with AMBS in 2024 on the airing of old content under their Jeepney TV brand plus the noon show It’s Showtime and its primetime news show TV Patrol. In a press statement on Wednesday, ABS-CBN thanked Pangilinan and TV5 “for providing a home for some ABS-CBN programs since 2021.” On Thursday, December 18, ABS-CBN told the Philippine Stock Exchange that the two “transactions have no significant impact on ABS-CBN’s operations.” – Rappler.com",True,true,"ABS-CBN settles money dispute with TV5, signs deal with Villar’s ALLTV",https://www.rappler.com/business/abs-cbn-settles-financial-dispute-tv5-signs-deal-manny-villar-alltv/,Rappler

"SEOUL, South Korea – South Korean e-commerce company Coupang announced on Monday, December 29, a compensation deal worth 1.69 trillion won ($1.18 billion) to holders of 33.7 million accounts for a massive data leak that triggered a backlash from users and lawmakers. Coupang said customers will get company vouchers of 50,000 won each. The plan comes a day after Coupang founder Kim Bom issued his first public apology for last month’s data breach and pledged to expedite compensation measures. However, Kim has declined to attend parliamentary hearings scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, citing prior commitments. However, criticism has mounted over Coupang’s decision to provide compensation in the form of vouchers that can only be used on its own services and platforms. Choi Min-hee, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party and chair of the National Assembly’s Science, ICT, Broadcasting and Communication committee, said in a Facebook post that Coupang was “bundling coupons for services no one uses,” criticizing the company for offering vouchers tied to its less popular services. She added that Coupang appeared to be trying to turn the crisis into a business opportunity. Consumer advocacy group Korea National Council of Consumer Organizations said Coupang’s plan made a mockery of consumers and downplayed the severity of the data breach, describing it as a marketing tool designed to encourage additional purchases rather than as a sign of restitution. When asked about public criticism of its compensation plan, Coupang said it had no further comment. South Korea’s parliament plans to hold two days of hearings on Coupang starting on Tuesday. – Rappler.com",True,true,Coupang announces $1.18-billion compensation to South Korean users for data leak,https://www.rappler.com/technology/coupang-compensation-south-korean-users-data-leak/,Rappler
"SAN FERNANDO CITY, La Union – Months before October 17, 2025, the opening date of SM City La Union, banners had begun to pepper public spaces across the province. The quantity of announcements — on roadside billboards, building walls, and bus stops — felt almost like an election campaign, except this one came with corporate polish and sizzle. Online, Ilocanos speculated about which brands were coming, and whether the already congested roads of San Fernando, the province’s capital, could handle the traffic. There was unease, but also excitement. When the day came, 51,000 Ilocanos flooded the new mall, surpassing even SM City Laoag’s May 2025 debut by 29%. The crowd kept coming: 41,000 and 51,000 more arrived on Saturday and Sunday. Outside, traffic slowed to a crawl. Inside, the province saw, for the first time, what its own SM looked and felt like, no longer the distant cousin to the malls in Baguio or Pangasinan. Even the skeptics paused to look, not at the mall itself, but at what its arrival meant for the province they thought they already knew. “La Union is very strategic,” said Hans Sy, son of SM founder Henry Sy, who flew in with several family members a day before the opening. “It’s like the junction. It’s in the middle of everything.” SM has previously opened malls in Baguio, Rosales, Tuguegarao, and Laoag — all in northern Luzon. (TRIVIA: What some of the richest Filipinos have in common) That word — junction — has long defined the province. At the foot of Baguio to the east, La Union sits midway along the corridor linking Pangasinan, Ilocos Sur, and Ilocos Norte. Its soil is sandy, less fertile than the plains farther north where tobacco and rice thrive, but its geography favors trade. Goods from the mountains and plains converge here. Buses from Manila, or those plying north–south routes, make their stopovers here. La Union is “ready for SM,” Sy stressed. Official statistics agree: The province’s economy is 81% service-driven, with low poverty (8.7%), a 99% literacy rate, and the region’s lowest loans-to-deposit ratio (14.4%) — signs of stability and spending power. San Fernando, the capital, is a place shaped more by movement than by harvest. It hosts regional offices of national agencies, Region 1’s main public hospital, about a dozen private hospitals, nearly all universal, commercial and some rural banks, as well as some of the largest schools in northern Luzon. To the north, San Juan thrives on surf and the Manila weekend crowd. To the south, Bauang stretches along the West Philippine Sea, once home to high-end resorts that hosted the country’s elite until the late 1980s. San Fernando sits between them, the weekday capital that handles the province’s governance and trade. The balance among these three towns mirrors La Union itself: leisure to one side, logistics on the other, bureaucracy in the middle. It is a rhythm of contrast. And the new mall now sits right at its center. But like other century-old city centers, San Fernando’s is bursting at the seams. The MacArthur National Highway slices through narrow streets that loop around the Saint William the Hermit Cathedral, city hall, public market, and city plaza. Small groceries and hardware stores, still family-run, crowd the ground floors of aging buildings. “Our city proper is beyond full,” explained La Union Representative Paolo Ortega. By nightfall, most storefronts close, leaving the city hushed except for pharmacies and ATMs glowing under fluorescent light. Ortega said that around 2014, SM had originally looked at a possible site along the road leading to Poro Point Freeport Zone, a former American military base jutting into the West Philippine Sea. The area was just about six hectares, but the parties did not agree on the land price. SM eventually settled three kilometers east of the old center, in Barangay Biday, along the Diversion Road built years earlier to reroute traffic. The current 9.8-hectare site was easier to consolidate and allowed room for expansion. La Union was no stranger to malls before SM arrived. San Fernando already had community centers such as CSI Mall and Manna Mall, while nearby Bauang hosted smaller strip complexes serving weekend tourists. In 2021, Robinsons Place La Union opened a 4-level mall along the highway, with 35,000 sqm of gross floor area and a 9-level parking building for almost 500 vehicles. What distinguishes SM City La Union is scale and scope: 51,000 sqm of leasable space across 3 levels, 1,104 parking slots, and a 5,000-sqm transport terminal. With a reach closer to a regional hub than a neighborhood arcade, Ilocanos who once traveled an hour uphill to SM Baguio or two hours south to SM Rosales felt that, finally, they had one of their own. “We’re not really only just after the town,” remarked Sy. “We’re making it a destination for the other people from the nearby towns.” SM City La Union expects up to 25,000 mallgoers on weekdays and 30,000 on weekends. SM City La Union stands inland, but its design nods to the province’s coastal identity. Its ceilings ripple like waves, sunlight floods the atrium, and greenery softens the concrete. “We saw that San Fernando is already an economic hub. We just needed to blend in the ‘Elyu vibe,’” said Rona Vida Correa, SM’s Regional Operations head for Northern Luzon. “Elyu,” from the first letters of “La Union,” nods to the slow, easy, affordable lifestyle that has long drawn surfers and weekenders. Inside, shoppers pause at Where Joy Gathers, Isaiah Cacnio’s LED staircase glowing in ocean hues. Outside, Magwayen’s Chrysalis, Leeroy New’s bamboo-and-plastic sculpture, greets visitors at the entrance. A unique feature is the Sandbox, a 1,000-sqm open-air plaza of sand, benches, play equipment, and a small stage for events. “Our goal is [to make] this a hub where people not only shop but also learn and connect,” Correa said. National and regional brands mix with local tenants, such as Arkus Balay, Kayu Café, Bebo’s Bombay Burrito, Rufilita’s Bakeshop, Seawadeeka, The Lewis House, and La Gula Desserts. The country’s first J.CO Reserve also opened here, featuring a copper ceiling painted with ocean motifs. When asked about SM’s image as the “big, bad capitalist,” Correa described a corporate strategy rooted in what she called “progress that includes people.” Years before the mall opened, SM Foundation had donated a new two-storey, four-classroom building to a nearby public elementary school and granted scholarships to its students. “We also continue the Kabalikat sa Kabuhayan program with the Department of Agriculture to train farmers here and give them direct market access,” Correa said, referring to the produce under “Bonus” brand sold in the SM grocery. It’s about being “a good neighbor,” she said, and a “partner,” not an adversary. “We always tell our teams that we want to help the businesses in the mall — and the communities outside — to evolve.” San Fernando Mayor Hermenegildo Gualberto called the mall “a sign that San Fernando has arrived.” At full operation, he said, the complex will employ about 2,000 people, nearly 80% of them locals. Traffic remains his concern. “We’re trying to manage it. The traffic, we are prepared for it. Hopefully our strategies in managing traffic would work,” Gualberto said. The city continues to reroute vehicles to keep the narrow Diversion Road moving. An extension of the Tarlac-Pangasian-La Union Expressway (TPLEx) to San Juan, bypassing the clogged roads of San Fernando, is expected by 2028. The TPLEx has already cut travel time from Manila to northern Luzon and boosted tourist arrivals in La Union to over 540,000 in 2024. A fixture on tourist itineraries, Halo-Halo de Iloko is a converted ancestral home filled with Ilocano art and dishes. Founder Xavier Mercado built it long before “Elyu” became a hashtag. Now, he watches mall traffic pull away younger diners. “When I first heard that an SM mall would be built here, I was a mix of emotions — excited, nervous, and a bit skeptical,” Mercado said. “I was worried that people would flock to the new mall and forget about my humble establishment.” Since the opening, he said, “I’ve actually seen a decrease in customer flow and sales. I think it’s because SM brought in a lot of new choices of restaurants.” Yet he sees the development as a turning point. “For me, the SM mall symbolizes progress and convenience,” he said. “It’s a sign that our city is growing and moving forward. But it’s also a reminder that we need to adapt and evolve to stay competitive.” Mercado hopes large corporations and local government will treat small entrepreneurs as collaborators. “Local entrepreneurs like me are the backbone of this city,” he said. “We’re not just competitors, we’re partners in growth.” For Nicole de Leon, a 28-year-old content creator who relocated to San Juan from Manila, the mall’s arrival was more about practicality than spectacle. “From the perspective of buying essentials, I think that the mall provides convenience,” she said. “The locals are able to purchase a lot of their essentials or maybe some of the things that they want that they couldn’t buy before.” “A lot of stores have opened up that weren’t available here before,” she added. “As a girl, the variety of makeup now available here means I don’t have to them online. I can come here, test out the product. When I’m buying foundation, I can try what shade fits my skin.” Beside the complex, Annabelle Tan lives close enough to hear its pulse. “Too much noise,” she said. “Party sounds, all day, especially at night. And not just on weekends. Their speakers are massive.” Still, she noted its benefits — more jobs, more housing demand. “Transient demand is rising,” she said. Her insurance clients, she added, often mention how small shops outside the mall are losing customers. Some are still recovering from Typhoon Emong, a Category 4 storm that damaged many houses and buildings in July. “Many are still recovering,” she said. “And now SM is here.” By 7 pm, the old city’s shops are closed. But along the Diversion Road, headlights still stream past the mall’s façade. Inside, a movie begins. Outside, vendors sell grilled corn and fish balls under the blue light of the sculpture. “Bulabog is real,” Anna Belle said earlier, half-amused. It is the soundtrack of adjustment — the hum of a place discovering that progress, too, has volume. La Union was never built for stillness. Its name, after all, means union: of mountains and sea, of weekdays and weekends, of past and promise. The province, once known for its waves, is learning a new rhythm on land. – Rappler.com Lala Rimando wrote about Philippine business, and managed newsrooms, including Newsbreak, ABS-CBN, Rappler, and Forbes, for over 25 years.

"(This is a press release from Kaya Founders.) Kaya Founders, a Philippines-based venture capital (VC) firm, announced on Tuesday, November 11, the successful final close of its US$25 million fund, marking a major milestone in Kaya’s mission to back the next generation of Filipino and regional founders building technology-driven solutions for the Philippines and Southeast Asia. Helmed by operators-turned-angel investors Paulo Campos (ex-CEO, Zalora Philippines), Lisa Gokongwei-Cheng (CEO, Summit Media), and Ray Alimurung (ex-CEO, Lazada Philippines), Kaya Founders is the Philippines’ most active early-stage VC fund in the Philippines today. Its second fund follows a stapled fund structure and includes the firm’s “Zero to One” Pre-seed Fund and its “One to Ten” Seed to Series A Fund. This two-pronged structure is designed to support founders from idea stage to growth scale. Investors into the fund include a diverse and strong mix of local and international partners such as Singapore-based Pavilion Capital, Boston-based hedge fund Bracebridge Capital, Chicago-based Concentric Equity Partners, alongside leading local family offices and technology operators. Kaya previously announced its partnership with local technology solutions provider AMTI in April 2023, who serves as an anchor investor in the fund. Founded in 2021, Kaya Founders has built a portfolio of over 40 startups across multiple sectors including e-commerce, fintech, education, healthcare, software-as-a-service, agriculture, and more. Notable investments include e-commerce enabler Etaily, which breached $100m in annualized revenue earlier this year; cloud logistics platform Locad, which secured a $9 million pre-Series B in November 2024; banking-as-a-service provider Netbank, which completed a Series A round led by BEENEXT; and PayMongo, one of the leading payments providers in the country backed by US fintech Stripe. With this second fund, Kaya Founders aims to back 10 to 20 additional startups across the Philippines and Southeast Asia over the next three years. In line with its continued focus on innovation for financial inclusion and sustainability, Kaya Founders has made new investments this past year in Datung, ProTech, LenderLink, and SunFund. These companies represent a growing wave of innovators advancing financial access, digital inclusion, and clean energy. Datung uses AI-powered credit scoring and community-based lending networks to provide fair financing for underserved MSMEs. ProTech offers affordable, embedded device protection through an insurtech model designed for emerging markets. LenderLink is building a credit data marketplace aggregating lenders and enabling borrowers to share their credit history. SunFund makes solar energy adoption accessible for households and SMEs through a monthly subscription model, accelerating the country’s shift toward a low-carbon economy. Kaya Founders’ announcement of its final close coincides with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Startup Venture Fund of the National Development Company (NDC), an investment arm of the Philippine government. The partnership builds on Kaya’s appointment as an official co-investment partner of the SVF and reflects the government’s continued commitment to deepen collaboration with the private sector. The strategic partnership aims to expand capital access for Filipino startups, igniting innovation, job creation and inclusive economic growth. The firm sees a strong opportunity for disciplined early stage investing as the regional funding environment normalizes and the Philippines start-up ecosystem continues to mature. With operational expertise and deep conviction in the local market, Kaya is well positioned to offer its investors differentiated access to the next generation of high growth companies and an attractive entry point into one of the region’s fastest growing tech ecosystems. Indeed, as global capital crowds into AI in the US and regional investors recalibrate in the wake of Indonesia’s governance crisis, a funding gap has opened up across Southeast Asia. For early-stage investors, this is a rare window. Kaya is doubling down on this whitespace — backing high-growth ventures across its core thematic areas: namely, “Frictionless Business”, the “New Filipino Consumer”, and “Embedded Credit”. A post shared by Kaya Founders (@kayafounders) The firm believes that these areas will define the region’s next wave of category leaders, and offer its LPs one of the most compelling avenues for returns in the decade ahead. “At Kaya, we’ve always believed in building the future we want to see. This fund close is more than a milestone—it’s a vote of confidence in that vision. At a time when investor sentiment in Southeast Asia’s tech ecosystem is being tested, we’re doubling down on the Philippines. We see an exciting market brimming with talent, ambition, and untapped opportunities for company-building. This moment brings us one step closer to realizing the future we’re committed to creating,” says founding managing general partner Paulo Campos. – Rappler.com",True,true,Kaya Founders raises $25M fund to back more Filipino founders,https://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/advisories/kaya-founders-raises-funds-back-filipino-startups/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Cheng family, owner of major poultry producer Bounty Fresh and roasted chicken brands Chooks-to-Go and Uling Roasters, further increased their controlling stake in The Bistro Group of restaurants after buying the minority interest of legacy firm Anscor for P1.9 billion on Wednesday, October 1. The Cheng family became majority owner of The Bistro Group only last August after market regulator Philippine Competition Commission cleared their acquisition of the restaurant operator from private equity firm Navegar I Pte. Ltd. (Navegar). The latter invests in various Philippine firms, and bought into The Bistro Group (TBG Food Holdings Inc.) in 2014. (READ: How Bounty Fresh’s ‘Food Made Better’ promise is more than a tagline) A. Soriano Corporation (Anscor), led by tycoon Andres “Andy” Soriano III, disclosed on Thursday, October 2, that it sold its entire minority stake in TBG Food Holdings (TBG), the corporate entity of The Bistro Group, to the Chengs’ Inoza Business Holdings (Inoza). “Anscor extends its best wishes to the Bistro and Inoza teams. We are confident they will continue delighting Filipino consumers with their quality dining experiences for many years to come, and we look forward to seeing their continued success,” the 95-year-old Philippine company said. The Bistro Group is one of the biggest restaurant operators in the Philippines with more than 200 full-service restaurants and over 20 brands catering mainly to the middle- to upper-income classes. These include (in alphabetical order): The Bistro Group plans to open 100 more stores over the next 5 years, including American sports bar-restaurant Dave & Buster’s. It recently opened Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chāo in Glorietta Mall, Makati. A post shared by Fogo De Chao (@fogodechaophilippines) Anscor had invested P1.6 billion in TBG only last November 13, 2024 in a deal with Navegar, so the sale of its minority stake means a windfall of P304 million for Andy Soriano III’s investment firm in less than a year. Anscor, at that time, described it as an investment “in one of the most attractive and resilient market segments in the Philippines, the consumer sector.” Months later, Navegar sold its majority stake in TBG to Inoza. “The transaction represents value realization by Anscor of its investment in TBG. Anscor realized gross annualized returns greater than 25% on its investment in TBG, through a combination of distributions and capital gains,” Anscor said in its disclosure. One of Anscor’s subsidiaries is Seven Seas Resorts and Leisure Incorporated, owner of the world-renowned Amanpulo Resort, a 90-hectare island in Pamalican, Palawan province. Bounty Fresh started in 1986 with a single poultry house producing fresh eggs in the province of Bulacan, and has since grown to being one of the largest integrated poultry producers in the Philippines. It is led by Bounty Fresh Group Holdings Inc. (BFGHI) chairman Tennyson Chen and CEO Kenneth Cheng. Their Chooks-to-Go food business now has over 1,800 outlets nationwide. (READ: How Chooks to Go built a business bigger than GMA Network) The Cheng family is also known in the Philippines for supporting various sports activities, including the Philippine men’s basketball team Gilas Pillipinas, and the Philippine men’s football team Azkals. Bounty Fresh has also partnered with FIBA to promote 3×3 basketball in the Philippines via the Chooks-to-Go Pilipinas 3×3 tournaments. The Bistro Group started in the Philippines over 30 years ago when entrepreneur William “Bill” Stelton brought the American casual restaurant TGI Friday’s, opening his first store in Glorietta, Makati in 1994. A post shared by The Bistro Group (@thebistrogroup) TGI Friday’s was a big hit, and The Bistro Group expanded by bringing in Italian-American restaurant Italianni’s next.

"The two-tiered specific tax on Sweetened Beverages (SBs) was introduced through Republic Act No. 10963, or the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law, enacted in 2017 and implemented in January 2018. This policy led to higher prices for sweetened drinks, with a tax of P6 per liter for beverages using caloric and non-caloric sweeteners and P12 per liter for those containing high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The tax was introduced for two main reasons: (1) to raise government revenue and (2) to discourage the consumption of sugary drinks linked to obesity and higher risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). On September 30, 2025, House Bill No. 5003 was introduced to strengthen the effectiveness of the current sugar-sweetened beverages tax policy by updating the tax rates and expanding its coverage. The bill aims to further reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages and address the growing cases of NCDs, overweight, obesity, and undernutrition linked to dental caries, while also increasing government revenue to fund urgent health and nutrition programs. Under Section 150-B, an excise tax increase from P6 to P20 per liter of volume capacity shall be imposed, assessed, and collected on sweetened beverages using purely caloric sweeteners, purely non-caloric sweeteners, or a mix of the two. Sweetened beverages that use purely coconut sap sugar and purely steviol glycosides remain exempt from the tax. Meanwhile, beverages using purely high fructose corn syrup or any combination of HFCS with caloric or non-caloric sweeteners shall be subject to a higher tax rate, increased from P12 to P40 per liter of volume capacity. In addition, the new law will impose an excise tax of P6 per liter of volume capacity on all flavored milk, fermented milk, flavored non-dairy milk, and sweetened coffee products. Lastly, the newly created Section 150-C provides that the tax rates shall be automatically increased by six percent (6%) every year, effective January 1, 2026, if the bill is enacted. Under the proposed amendment, the allocation of revenues from the excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages has been revised. The portion allocated to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) for the implementation of the Universal Health Care Act of 2019 is reduced from 80% to 40%. Similarly, the share allotted nationwide for medical assistance, the Health Facilities Enhancement Program (HFEP), and other health-related needs managed by the Department of Health (DOH) is decreased from 20% to 10%, with allocations distributed by political and district subdivisions. The remaining 50% of the total revenue shall be allocated to the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) for distribution to provinces to support local health and nutrition programs. This 50% DILG share is further divided into two (2) portions; the 40% shall be used for nutrition-specific programs targeting children aged zero to five years, as well as pregnant and lactating women. While the remaining 10% shall fund nutrition-sensitive interventions, such as water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs, as determined by the DILG. This revised allocation aims to balance support for universal health care with a stronger focus on local nutrition and hygiene initiatives, ensuring that the health impacts of sugary drink consumption are addressed from both preventive and curative perspectives. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Ask the Tax Whiz] How do Filipinos benefit from a higher excise tax on sugary drinks?,https://www.rappler.com/business/ask-the-tax-whiz-how-filipinos-benefit-higher-excise-sugar-drinks/,Rappler

"BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – The Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) said it has secured a series of favorable court rulings related to Camp John Hay, citing recent dismissals of multiple civil cases involving land claims within the John Hay Special Economic Zone. In a statement, BCDA said the Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 79 of Baguio City dismissed six cases filed by private parties, including petitions for quieting of title, recovery of possession, and a promissory estoppel case. The cases involved properties located within the former American military reservation now managed by BCDA. BCDA said the rulings support its position following the government’s takeover of Camp John Hay and provide greater legal clarity over land administration within the zone. “These rulings help provide stability for investors and stakeholders,” BCDA chairperson Larry Paredes said, adding that the agency believes the decisions allow it to move forward with redevelopment plans for the property. BCDA president and chief executive officer Joshua Bingcang likewise said the dismissals reinforce the agency’s efforts to reposition Camp John Hay as a mixed-use development, citing models such as Bonifacio Global City and New Clark City. The dismissed cases form part of a larger set of legal disputes arising after the Supreme Court upheld the government’s reclamation of Camp John Hay in 2024, enforcing a 2015 arbitral ruling that ordered Camp John Hay Development Corporation (CJHDevCo) and entities claiming rights under it to vacate the leased property. Following that ruling, several civil and criminal cases were filed involving land claims and post-rescission transactions inside the estate. Earlier this year, the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) Branch 5 in Baguio City dismissed a criminal case for “other deceits” against CJHDevCo chairman Robert John Sobrepeña and Fil-Estate Management Incorporated vice president Ramon Jimenez. The court dismissed the case after the private complainants filed an affidavit of desistance, withdrawing their interest in pursuing the charges. In a subsequent manifestation, City Prosecutor Christian Amistad clarified that the dismissal was based solely on the complainants’ withdrawal and not on any judicial determination of the merits of the case, disputing public statements that framed the outcome as an acquittal. The Department of Justice has since created a special task force to look into transactions conducted after the rescission of CJHDevCo’s lease, signaling that other cases related to Camp John Hay may still arise. BCDA said it is finalizing an updated master development plan for Camp John Hay, describing the project as a self-sustaining, mixed-use district that will integrate ecotourism, commercial activity, education, healthcare, and green infrastructure. The agency said the plan is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and is being coordinated with the Baguio City government. BCDA said the redevelopment aims to generate employment and economic activity while preserving the area’s environmental character. City officials, however, have repeatedly raised concerns over unresolved issues related to revenue sharing, barangay segregation, and compliance with the 19 conditionalities set by the Baguio City Council in 1994, matters that the city government has said may soon be brought to court.

"MANILA, Philippines — Filipino fashion designer Patis Tesoro’s Filipiniana is Forever clothing line will be featured in a benefit fashion show by the Zonta Club of Alabang on November 4 at the Grand Hyatt Ballroom in Bonifacio Global City. Dubbed the “Grand Dame of Philippine Fashion” for her enduring service of cultural preservation, Tesoro debuts the 100-piece collection after two years of wanting to hold a fashion show. “Every time I would get started, my creations would immediately get sold. So for a while, it was hard for me to actually get a full collection together. Even then, I began building the black and white pavilion on my property where I envisioned doing a show,” the 74-year-old Laguna-based designer shared. Zonta Club of Alabang president Kathleen Liechtenstein supported this vision of Tesoro when she caught wind of the renowned fashion designer’s plans for such a show. “In all her endeavors, Patis has also contributed to empowering women from artisanal communities. Her team, for example, is made up of 90% women. This was an apparent common ground that we started from. Her work is meaningful because she brings Filipino artistry, craft, and techniques to the next generation, ensuring that it will live on,” Liechtenstein said. Tesoro’s dedication to the piña weaving revival started when she made several trips to Aklan in 1986. At the time, Aklan was the only source of piña in the country. Piña weaving is a traditional craft that originated from Aklan province, which uses a delicate handwoven fabric from pineapple leaf fibers. According to a profile by Vogue Philippines, Tesoro met with generational weavers and learned about their processes before collaborating with its local governments to administer weaving programs for the children. She then moved on to the Lumban and Abra provinces to revive natural dyes in clothing. Tesoro is attributed to reviving other textile and clothing industries in the country. These include natural dyes and textile weaving in Ifugao, abaca weaving and pineapple fibers with silk threads in Kalibo, and Mandaya fiber, among others. Tickets are priced at P6,000, with the proceeds from the benefit show to be donated to the club’s partner organizations and initiatives. Among the beneficiaries are the following: Tesoro, whose full name is Maria Beatriz “Patis” Pamintuan Tesoro, learned dressmaking from her mother in Iloilo before becoming a renowned fashion designer, heritage conservationist, and entrepreneur. In September 2016, she was lauded with the Gawad Tanglaw ng Lahi award during the Traditional University Awards at Ateneo de Manila University. In March, she published her book Filipiniana is Forever. The book contains over 40 years of her life and dedication to fashion and art. – Juliana Chloe Gonzales/Rappler.com Juliana Chloe Gonzales is a Rappler intern studying AB Communication Arts at De La Salle University.",True,true,Patis Tesoro’s ‘Filipiniana is Forever’ line to be featured in benefit show,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/style/patis-tesoro-filipiniana-forever-line-benefit-show-november-2025/,Rappler
"Online fast-fashion retailer Shein plans to open its first bricks-and-mortar shops in France in November under an agreement with department store owner Société des Grands Magasins, a move that sparked criticism from French retailers. The stores in the BHV department store in central Paris and Galeries Lafayette department stores in five other French cities mark a new step for Shein, which has up to now only hosted temporary marketing-driven pop-ups around the world. SGM president Frédéric Merlin said the launch would attract a younger clientele, adding that a customer might buy a Shein item and a designer handbag on the same day. Galeries Lafayette, which sold the stores operated by SGM under its name through a franchise agreement, said it opposed the move, which would violate the franchise agreement, and plans to stop it from happening. “Galeries Lafayette profoundly disagrees with this decision with regards to the positioning and practices of this ultra fast fashion brand that is in contradiction with its offer and values,” the group said in a statement. The move was, however, criticized by Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who said it went against the broader goals of Paris to promote what Hidalgo described as ‘sustainable local commerce’, such as by backing local businesses and locally-made goods. “We are extremely concerned by BHV’s decision to host, in November, the first permanent store of the Shein company in France,” wrote Hidalgo on LinkedIn. Shein, which sells 12-euro dresses and 20-euro jeans, faces pressure from other retailers, politicians and regulators in France, where lawmakers have backed a draft law regulating fast fashion that would, if implemented, ban Shein from advertising. “In front of the Paris City Hall, they are creating the new Shein megastore, which – after destroying dozens of French brands – aims to flood our market even more massively with disposable products,” Yann Rivoallan, head of fashion retail association Fédération Francaise du Pret-a-Porter, said in a statement. French retailers were already struggling to compete with Zara and H&M when Shein launched, drawing cost-conscious consumers in with its discounts. Several French fast-fashion retailers such as Jennyfer and NafNaf went into insolvency proceedings earlier this year. Shein sells clothes and accessories at rock-bottom prices thanks to its business model of sending parcels direct from factories in China to shoppers around the world, benefiting from customs rules giving low-value e-commerce parcels an exemption from duties. Shein executives have said its success is due to its online-only business model, meaning it has little unsold inventory, unlike bricks-and-mortar retailers. Setting up physical stores is a big departure from that model, requiring the company to maintain inventory in stores, which will add to running costs. It comes as Shein adapts to changes in its biggest market, the U.S., where its “de minimis” duty exemption for low-value parcels is ending. The European Union is planning to do the same. Shein’s first store, on the sixth floor of the BHV, will open in early November, with later openings planned in Galeries Lafayette department stores in Dijon, Grenoble, Reims, Limoges, and Angers. Executive Chairman Donald Tang has said in interviews that Shein is especially popular in provincial and rural areas where he says customers have fewer options for fashionable clothes. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Shein to open bricks-and-mortar shops in France, sparking backlash",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/style/shein-bricks-mortar-shops-france-sparks-backlash/,Rappler

"Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer: My husband “Mark” was supposed to be working on our Christmas card list last night when we got surprised by an old schoolmate who visited unexpectedly. He must have forgotten to turn off his computer because, when I started cleaning his office, I saw a scantily-clad woman with enormous breasts, pointing at them and with her saying, “These are for you, Merry Christmas.” I stood there with the trapo (dusting cloth), mouth wide open, trying to understand what I was seeing. It gets worse: Looking at his browsing history, I saw his constantly looking at porn sites. I am outraged. I am surprised beyond belief. I feel so wronged. Where did we go wrong? Where did I go wrong? Should I talk to him about it? But when? We have parties every day this week, and, on Christmas Eve, we host one for his co-workers, and on Christmas Day, we spend the day at my parents’. Maybe I should just leave home now. Leave it to him to explain why I am gone. (I wonder what excuse he will use?) But is it too soon to take my children with me? Also, I do not want to let him down on Christmas Eve, despite what he has been doing to me these months. Does watching porn mean he will cheat later on in the marriage? Please help,Upset Wife Dear Upset Wife (UW), Attitudes to porn now differ according to many variables, such as age, culture, religion, geography, etc. For centuries, porn was frowned upon and relatively inaccessible, but with the advent of the internet, anyone of any age now just needs a WiFi connection to have unlimited porn available 24/7. This has radically changed how porn is viewed in many parts of the world. Those brought up in the internet era tend to have a more liberal view, especially if they live in Europe or North America, where religious strictures carry less weight. A study by Barna shows in some detail the ubiquity of porn use and the diminishing sense of guilt surrounding it, although the study is confined to the US. The main findings are quite revealing: While there is no reason why you, UW, should meekly accept the views of an American study, it does seem as though your reaction to this discovery of your husband’s porn use is somewhat extreme. In many cases, watching porn is nothing more than an extension of having sexual fantasies that the watcher has no intention of turning into reality. Studies have investigated the possibility of a connection between porn and sexual violence, but results seem contradictory and uncertain. In any case, it is clearly not the case that all porn watchers become violent sex offenders. Perhaps, instead of leaving, what you need to do is discuss the matter with your husband. Why does he need to watch porn? Is this a mere pleasure (like enjoying a beer after work, for example) or a need to fill a void or something else? Surely his motivation is crucial to establishing how you should respond to your discovery and then calibrating your response. After all, it may be that this habit of his is of minor significance and, even if it isn’t, you should pause and consider your possible responses before blowing up your marriage completely. Best wishes, JAF Baer Dear UW: Thank you very much for your letter. First, let us answer the question you asked in your last paragraph: “Does watching porn mean he will cheat later on in the marriage?” Not necessarily. There is no reason looking at a picture of another woman with bigger breasts than you will inevitably lead to infidelity. Factors that relate to infidelity have more to do with relationship satisfaction, communication, individual values, commitment levels, etc. I understand your sense of outrage and the need that you respond to it in no uncertain terms. Perfectly understandable. After all, what you discovered hit you in the gut and probably felt like a personal attack (like it does to most partners who discover what you did). However, I commend you for not leaving home immediately with your children, leaving him to explain your absence to your guests. Not many could react as fiercely as you did and yet still be able to decide against it, because you did “not want to let him down on Christmas Eve.” I am hoping that the resilience and care within you that helped you go against your instinct when you saw what you saw will also be there when you talk with him about what you saw. As Lori Gottlieb, author of the memoir Maybe You Should Talk to Someone: A Therapist, Her Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed (2019), often writes, “Speak to him from a place of curiosity, rather than of blame.” Dearest UW, if you can do that, I feel you will have won half the battle — at least as far as pornography is concerned — because I think the effect that viewing pornography has on your relationship depends on much more than the actual fact of his watching. These factors — his childhood, his view of his parents’ relationship, your relationship with him, his expectation of how loving husbands and wives support each other, to name a few — are what have to be explored when you have your talk. What you both want to really get at would be related to broader issues like communication, trust, intimacy, and differing sexual expectations. It is not only his answers that matter, but yours too. Not that you can expect to have your feelings (his and yours) addressed overnight. But perhaps the immediate ones from both your sides can be answered fairly early? On your side, those might include: what his watching porn means to you, how it made you feel, and will he stop? Or at least try to (and immediately tell you if he finds it difficult to do so). On his side, these might include: if this does not take anything away from how I feel about you and the kids, I don’t understand; please explain to me why you think it is a gross offense. Please help me understand how it can bother you in the first place? How about if we watch it together? It is important you are open to each other both about general issues — finances, your respective families, expectations of how much time you spend on the family — and about the particular (sex). That is the reason asking from a place of curiosity rather than blame is so important. Since you are the person to start this conversation, your tone will help determine whether your first (and hopefully the following) encounters will be worthwhile or not. Should these admittedly difficult conversations lead to greater acceptance, cooperation, and, yes, even love — this might even be the very best gift you will being each other this holiday season.

"MANILA, Philippines – If you’re someone who loves art but is too busy to visit museums, don’t worry! These films serve as your all-access museum pass, with each one showcasing a glimpse into the world of art. From stories set inside the museums to films that feature artworks and painters, each one proves that creativity doesn’t just hang on walls but can tell stories beyond the frame. Seeming like a museum tour in the form of a film, Russian Ark was shot entirely inside the Winter Palace of the Russian State Hermitage Museum in Russia. The film follows an unnamed time-traveling guest as they journey through the palace, witnessing moments of Russian history and the place’s art collection in one continuous take. Directed by Alexander Sokurov, this unedited historical drama film runs for 96 minutes. The film takes viewers through 33 rooms of the museum, showcasing various artworks. Based on Dan Brown’s bestselling novel, The Da Vinci Code is a mystery thriller film that gives viewers a tour inside the world-famous Musée du Louvre (Louvre Museum) in Paris, France. Tom Hanks takes on the role of a symbologist who is entangled in a murder mystery inside the Louvre. The plot unfolds as they unpack secrets hidden within some of the iconic artworks in the museum. Among the key paintings in the film is, of course, Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. The production revealed that they’ve only used its replica since they were not allowed to illuminate the real painting with production lights. Travel back in time with the romcom Midnight in Paris. Its unique time travel story follows a screenwriter who travels to 1920s in Paris every day at midnight. Starring Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams, this multi-awarded winning film features several museums to visit in Paris, France. Included in the list is the Musée Rodin (Rodin Museum), which houses Auguste Rodin’s artworks, The Thinker and The Gates of Hell. You can also spot in the film the Musée de l’Orangerie (Orangerie Museum), home to Monet’s Water Lilies and Picasso’s Large Bather. Another museum in the film is des Arts Forains (Museum of Fairground Art). While Angelica Panganiban and JM de Guzman’s That Thing Called Tadhana is known for its memorable lines about heartbreak and romance, one of its scenes was actually shot in a museum! The scene was shot at Ben Cab Museum in Tuba, Benguet. Founded by National Artist Benedicto Cabrera, or BenCab, the museum features his own artworks alongside a rich collection of contemporary and traditional art, including indigenous crafts and pieces. Ang Larawan is a film adaptation of National Artist for Literature Nick Joaquin’s play, A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino. The local musical film is set in Intramuros before the start of World War II. It tells the story of two daughters, the Marasigan siblings, who find themselves facing a financial struggle and a tough decision on whether or not to sell the painting made by their high-profile father who is sick. The film was first released at the 30th Tokyo International Film Festival in 2017. In the same year, it was released locally at the 43rd Metro Manila Film Festival, where it won several awards including Best Picture and Best Musical Score. Loving Vincent is not just a typical animated film — it’s actually the first-ever fully painted feature film in the world. It celebrates the artistry of the famous Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh and explores his life during his final years. The film brings to life more than 100 of his paintings to narrate his story. Made entirely with oil paintings, the film was made successful by 125 artists from all over the world producing 65,000 frames. The paintings were created using techniques inspired by Van Gogh’s unique style. “Spolarium.” “Spoliarium.” “I’m an Art Studies major, I know my Juan Luna.” “I’m an Eheads fan, I know my Eraserheads.” This famous line exchange comes from LizQuen’s romance film Alone/Together. It follows the story of Tin (Liza Soberano), an Iskolar ng Bayan Art Studies major, as she reconnects with her former Thomasian sweetheart, Raf (Enrique Gil). Some of the scenes were filmed at the UP Vargas Museum in Quezon City, and at the National Museum of Fine Arts in Manila, where the film features a memorable scene in front of Juan Luna’s renowned painting, Spoliarium. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, even Marvel characters can be spotted in museums. The Eternals features Sersi (Gemma Chan), an Eternal who works as a museum curator at the National History Museum in London. Her love interest, Dane Whitman (Kit Harrington) also works at the same museum. Some scenes show the characters walking through the halls of the museum and with the art exhibits. Meanwhile, in Black Panther, villain Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) steals an ancient Vibranium Ax and the Dogon Mask, an African artifact, from the fictional Museum of Great Britain. Although this museum doesn’t exist in real life, the scene was actually filmed at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia. A new historical film from the TBA Studio’s Bayaniverse trilogy, Quezon (2025) narrates the story of the second president of the Philippines, Manuel Quezon, and his fight for Philippine independence. In the film, the front of the National Museum of Fine Arts is visible during Quezon’s (Jericho Rosales) inauguration speech. – Rappler.com Alessandria Corral is a Rappler intern and a Bachelor of Arts in Speech Communication student at the University of the Philippines Diliman.",True,true,"How museums, art add color to these 10 international, local films",https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/local-international-films-feature-art-museums/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Facebook ads, reel algorithms, online celebrity sightings, and influencer-driven campaigns — VIVAIA is a name many women recognize purely from social media. It’s a genius marketing strategy that plays on the “out of sight, out of mind” belief — since it is all over one’s timeline, name recall subconsciously starts to grow. And yet, instead of feeling annoyed, people grew curious. Word-of-mouth customers swear by its comfort, flexibility, and inclusivity in terms of foot size and shape, and others begin to think: Is it really as good as people say it is? For years, many Filipinos relied on worldwide shipping or pasabuy orders just to get their hands — and feet — on a pair. That’s why shoppers were ecstatic when VIVAIA finally opened a pop-up store at Power Plant Mall in Rockwell in January 2025. Lines formed, with many nervously anticipating that this would be the last they’d see of the brand in the country — the pop-up was only for three months. But more pop-up stores followed, and shortly after, permanent spaces. Shangri-La Plaza came next, followed by SM Megamall, Glorietta, Power Plant, SM Mall of Asia, and more locations already in the pipeline, all in less than a year. How did the Philippine team pull this off so quickly? “Our vision was to introduce a brand we truly believed in — one that offered quality, comfort, and style that Filipinas could connect with,” VIVAIA PH CEO Eira Peña told Rappler. And the rest followed. VIVAIA PH operates under Peña’s business group AMAVI, whose name comes from the Latin phrase Veni, Vidi, Amavi — “I came, I saw, I loved.” That’s why Peña only brings in brands she and her partners personally use and love. When they discovered VIVAIA, the alignment felt natural, especially with the founders’ vision. “It was the first brand we felt fully confident in, not only because of its strong sustainability mission, but because we saw a real gap in the local market,” Peña said. “There weren’t many options that combined sustainability, comfort, and style. VIVAIA filled that need perfectly.” The Power Plant pop-up was them dipping their toes into the market. They didn’t expect the long lines on opening day. “We honestly didn’t anticipate the overwhelming response,” Peña said. “Seeing how quickly customers embraced the brand — and how it became part of their everyday lives — has been incredibly rewarding. It reassures us that there’s a real appetite for thoughtfully made, globally loved products in the local market.” There is a growing Gen Z preference for eco-conscious brands. Younger consumers are more willing to spend on intentionally made pieces that are more expensive but last longer, rather than cheaper options from fast fashion or overseas. VIVAIA’s shoes are made using recycled and eco-friendly materials that are carefully sourced and thoughtfully repurposed; from recycled PET and sugarcane EVA, to repurposed faux fur, rice husks, herbal insoles, natural rubber, and recycled packaging. Founded around a simple pain point of the VIVAIA’s founder — “why can’t heels, and women’s shoes in general, feel as comfortable as sneakers? ” — the brand now operates in 61 countries and has recycled over 36 million plastic bottles worldwide. The brand also uses knit-to-shape technology, which reduces production waste by over 30% compared to traditional footwear processes. Many styles are machine washable, while others can be wiped clean with a VIVAIA cleaning kit, “reducing the need to throw shoes away once they get dirty,” the brand said. “The response to our messaging has been really positive,” Peña said. “More customers are moving away from traditional leather and seeking sustainable options. Many are genuinely amazed to learn that with every pair they purchase, they’re helping recycle six plastic bottles.” Bringing a globally known brand into the Philippines was “definitely a tough process,” Peña said. Challenging, like any brand entry, but more so because the team wanted to stay true to VIVAIA’s mission. In an economy that’s still developing and a market oversaturated with both local and international brands, feeling overwhelmed — as a consumer and as a brand owner — is normal. So for Peña, the challenge was making sure VIVAIA didn’t become just another “fad” or viral trend. “We feel like the brand has done well staying classic, while also keeping up — and sometimes even setting the trend — through product development,” she said. “Each product keeps evolving, and we hear that directly through customer feedback.” This is where VIVAIA’s “2.0” approach comes in. Many styles are upgraded based on real user input — like the Margot 2.0, the improved version of the original bestseller. With feedback guiding development, versions 3.0 and beyond are part of the company’s strategy. But VIVAIA’s price point is another hurdle. With pairs of flats, sneakers, and heels priced between P6,000 and P10,000, VIVAIA sits on the higher end of the market. “Expensive doesn’t always mean better, and cheap doesn’t always mean worse,” Peña said. “It’s about striking the right balance — offering products that last, serve a real purpose in everyday life, and deliver true value for money.” Beyond aesthetics, Peña said the value lies in the full package: sustainability, craftsmanship, comfort, and ease of maintenance. “We’ve had customers tell us it’s the only shoe they use now because of how comfortable and easy it is to maintain,” she said. “Being machine washable saves them time and makes their shoes feel new for longer.” The brand’s expansion had been in the works for some time, but what sped it up was confidence — built on “incredible feedback” from Filipinas. “Their response reassured us that there’s a strong demand and appreciation for what we offer,” Peña said. Another key factor was the team behind the brand. “From operations and logistics to customer experience, it’s really a collective effort that made this rapid growth possible.” Power Plant Mall was always a goal because it aligned closely with the brand’s market. “We started with just a 14-square-meter pop-up,” Peña said. “Now we’ve grown into four permanent stores in less than a year. It really feels full circle.” Expanding quickly came with challenges, but it also forced the team to grow alongside the brand. “One of the biggest lessons was setting strong systems early on — from quality control to building a customer-centric retail team,” Peña said. “Even with minor hiccups, those challenges helped strengthen our operations and deepen our connection with customers.” Deciding which styles to bring in-store remains a challenge, given VIVAIA’s wide range of SKUs. The strategy, Peña said, is to always listen closely to your customers. “We carry our best-selling styles, but we also bring in those we get a lot of requests for,” she said. “We even make it a practice for our head office staff to assist in-store, just to hear feedback and understand what customers are looking for.” Beyond business success, Peña hopes VIVAIA PH can make a positive, lasting impact on Filipinas’ everyday lives with purposeful and peso-worthy shoes that can last. The long-term vision is to make the brand even more accessible, with upcoming stores in targeted Metro Manila locations before expanding to Visayas and Mindanao. For Peña, growth is slow and steady, and is achieved one step at a time. – Rappler.com",True,true,Viral ‘shoe-in’: Step-by-step sustainable journey of VIVAIA’s growth in PH,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/style/vivaia-philippines-business-journey-growth/,Rappler
"In my last article, I wrote about the just-concluded initial public offering (IPO) of Maynilad Water Services Incorporated, which was listed last Friday, November 7, 2025, under the trading symbol of “MYNLD.” In the article, I mentioned that with the exception of Joel De la Peña, market strategist and chief trader of H.E. Bennett Securities Incorporated, who was dead sure that MYNLD would tank even on listing day, the rest of the traders I talked to were optimistic, albeit cautious. To what I see in last Friday’s listing, MYNLD may be in for a difficult ride like what the market has been in general: MYNLD opened at its IPO offer price of P15 per share that also served as its session high; it traded lower to P14.98 a piece that also served as its session’s low and closing price for the day. Correspondingly, MYNLD was down P0.020 or 0.13% with a total volume for the day of about 100.81 million shares on a total value turnover of approximately P1.51 billion. This happened on the back of a selling pressure on the issue itself. To what I was told, one of the underwriters was behind the sell off. Nevertheless, it may be too early yet to say whether MYNLD will fall in the coming days as De la Peña is anticipating. MYNLD only fell one fluctuation lower throughout the trading session. On second thought, considering that MYNLD never had the chance to go up any higher than its opening price all throughout the trading session, it’s very possible that De la Peña may just get his wishes to come true. This is also supported by one almost forgotten maxim in the market, which says that a market’s one-year performance is sometimes already known by the results of its trading performance from its first month of trading for the year. Likewise, MYNLD’s initial trading performance may just be indicative enough of where the market is headed to. Remember, last Friday’s trading results: the market tanked again lower. This time, it closed at its three-year low of 5,759.37, reminiscent of its trading close on October 3, 2022. From what it has been doing all these months up to its trading results last Friday, the technical picture of the market can be described as: “bearish, facing significant pressure, and trading at historically low valuations.” In comparison to its regional and international peers, the market is now one of the world’s worst-performing markets. Out of this performance, around 18% or more of the market’s value has been lost since then. The general P/E ratio of the Philippine Stock Exchange Index’s (PSEi) composite stocks has now also gone down to as low as 8.2x. In retrospect, this is lower than the market’s P/E multiple during the March 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Based on historical averages, the market can be described as “significantly undervalued.” The market’s continuing fall has been attributed to the trading tack of foreign investors who have been described as “aggressively cashing out.” Foreign investors have been net sellers for the year until last Friday. The general pessimism stems from a combination of local and global factors. Foremost to local and foreign investors’ concern is the country’s slowing economic growth. As corroborated in last Friday announcement, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) slowed down in the 3rd quarter. GDP only grew by 4%. There are three major factors that are blamed for the market’s continued weakness and the country’s weak GDP growth. The first is about the escalating corruption scandal on public funds used in the government’s flood control program. The second is about the government’s weak spending or underspending activity to spur the economy. The third is about the structural issues confronting the market. The flood control corruption scandal has greatly angered the general public just as it has significantly eroded investors’ confidence and dampened bullish sentiments. Aside from the sporadic pockets of public rallies that are being held since the corruption scandal was exposed, a grand protest-rally similar to the historic EDSA People Power movement is being planned to be held on November 30. What it may come to as a result may also have a serious impact on the future political landscape, especially on the alignments among the political players. As to the government’s public spending program to spur economic growth, the government is reportedly lagging behind, especially on its educational and social safety nets, targeted spending to boost agriculture, climate resilience, and digital connectivity, in addition to its “Build Better More” infrastructure program. The government is called on to move faster on these areas of concerns. On its structural issues, the market continues to face medium- to long-term challenges, particularly to its liquidity and trading volume, which can be described as poor and thin compared to its regional peers. Added to that, the market lacks sectoral diversity. At present, the index is heavily concentrated in financials and industrials. Likewise, fewer companies are opting to go public due to the higher costs and stringent rules to get listed. Listed firms have, as well, historically underperformed — like what may just happen again to MYNLD despite being a great issue to lock in one’s investible fund. Senator Imee Marcos recently gave a simple solution to the market’s structural issues. At first, it appeared almost ridiculous but come to think of it, her suggestion has some sense of logic: it’s about time the bourse’s president, Ramon Monzon, is replaced. To her, Monzon has been there for too long for during his watch, the market has gone through the full cycle of trading from doom-to-boom and then from boom-to-doom seemingly oblivious — as in unaffected or unmitigated — by his presence. She then simply concludes that Monzon had his time, and the board of the bourse should now put new blood in the leadership helm. With regard to investors’ outlook, like any perspective, I believe that this will change eventually for the better — although not that soon, maybe. At the moment, many investors are taking a “risk-off” or “defensive positioning” stance. The market is definitely now out of favor: the local economy’s status, along with the political issues and the sporadic cases of social unrest, have not been helpful. The weakening of our currency against the US dollar to historic lows has likewise created selling pressures in the market. Together with concerns over a global economic slowdown and the not-so-impressive performance of key sectors like our electronics exports, the market has become that soft, and investors’ confidence has gone low. However, despite the overall market weakness, certain sectors continue to show some resilience and potential. Among these are the financial companies. The financials index has shown positive movements. The major banks have shown strong balance sheets supported by relatively high-interest-rate margins. Next is the mining and oil sector. It is also showing some promise: this sector has exhibited significant gains over time, driven by increasing commodity price trends and local policy developments. Among these government policies include the lifting of the moratorium on new mining permits, lifting the ban on open-pit mining, and promoting transparency through the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The EITI is a global standard for the open and accountable management of oil, gas, and mineral resources. It aims to improve governance in the extractive sector by requiring governments and companies to disclose information on contracts, production, revenues, and beneficial ownership. This disclosure helps to curb corruption, informed public debate, and promote reforms. The other supports arising from the government’s recent policies include financial incentives like tax exemptions on imported equipment for offshore oil and gas operations and a program to manage mineral reservations. The government has also started to focus on environmental and sustainability reforms to encourage responsible development and secure a place in global mineral supply chains. Continued government spending on the “Build, Better, More” program has provided a solid medium-term outlook for construction-related companies, as well. This sector is favored by investment analysts, supported by the Philippines’ strong domestic consumption base and robust remittances from overseas Filipinos. Despite these gleaming potentials that are present in the market, it may not still be timely to enter the market — in the same way like how De la Peña is thinking about buying MYNLD. Prices are already at their historical lows but due to low investors’ confidence and global uncertainties, the price of most stocks at the moment could still prove to be a value trap. A value trap is a situation when a stock or market appears to be an excellent bargain due to low valuation metrics, but is actually in a prolonged decline because of underlying fundamental problems. Unlike a true value stock and market ,which is expected to recover, a value trap’s stock price or market valuation continues to fall due to technical and fundamental issues. Until then, our market remains to be a value trap. – Rappler.com (The article has been prepared for general circulation for the reading public and must not be construed as an offer, or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or financial instruments whether referred to herein or otherwise.

"This week, on October 28, Tuesday, the peso slid to a historic low of P59.13 per US dollar. To be sure, this is not our first brush with the P59 per US dollar mark. You might recall that we’ve had similar brushes back in September-October 2022, and also November-December 2024. I wrote about it last year. What’s different now is that the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas or BSP seems to be more willing to allow the peso to slide even further, breaching the psychological P60-per-US-dollar barrier. BSP Governor Eli Remolona said that P60 per US dollar “is a possibility.” The BSP added that, “The recent peso depreciation may reflect market concerns over a potential moderation in economic growth due in part to the infrastructure spending controversy, as well as expectations of additional monetary policy easing by the BSP.” You see, even before the flood control controversy, our growth prospects were already dimming. The government had already trimmed its growth targets from 6-8% down to 5.5-6.5%. Reaching 6% growth these days seems like a moonshot. Slower growth is made worse by the flood control scandal. Myriad business groups are desperately asking the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to credibly solve this mess, because investors here and abroad are fast losing confidence in the Philippines. In a strongly worded statement, a big group of employers and workers’ associations recently called out the feeble investigations and prosecution of the government of people involved in flood control corruption. They said, “Instead of hold departure orders, we are told to be content with immigration lookout bulletins for now. Instead of criminal charges, we are fed daily promises of cases ‘soon to be filed.’ Instead of open transparent hearings, we get closed-door investigations whose direction remains unknown.” Worse, it’s possible that some investors are already moving their capital away from the Philippines to invest elsewhere. The stock market’s capitalization went down by hundreds of billions of pesos in recent weeks. When investors flee, the demand for dollars increases, and this makes the peso weaker. BSP Governor Remolona also remarked that there are now “fewer companies with expansion plans.” In case you missed it, even before this brouhaha, foreign direct investments have been stagnant (rather than growing) in recent years. The peso’s slide could be reversed by a sufficiently strong inflow of dollars. But foreign investors’ perceptions on the Philippine economy are also souring. Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez, our ambassador to the US, alleged that at least $100 billion in investments are being put off because of recent political events. The BSP, if it wanted to, can prevent the exchange rate from reaching P60 per US dollar. This was done before by the BSP under the watch of former governor Benjamin Diokno. Back in 2022, he drew a line in the sand and said that the BSP will aggressively prevent a breach. This was done by selling billions of dollars of the BSP’s reserves. Fast-forward to 2025, Governor Remolona seems less inclined to do such a thing. I would tend to agree with him. Shelling out tons of dollars just to avoid P60 per US dollar seems a huge waste of money. It would be better to keep that money to maintain a sufficiently large buffer of international reserves. Just let the exchange rate be determined by supply and demand. Of course, “defending” the peso may seem politically attractive, because it would be a historic first if we reached P60 per US dollar under Marcos’ watch. And not a few people might think that a historically “weak” peso might reflect a similar weakness of the President. But to be honest, I don’t care too much for the terms “weak” or “strong” peso. A “weak” peso, for instance, is actually a good thing for exporters (because our goods and services become more competitive) and dollar-earning OFWs (because the money they send home will translate into more pesos). The bigger concern is that our export industry is not sufficiently diversified to begin with: the biggest chunk of our exports remains to be semiconductors, and we can’t expect to earn a lot more if we don’t export goods which are higher value-added. The fact that the peso is weakening also suggests that remittance growth is not as strong as they used to be (because strong remittance inflows would tend to make the peso stronger rather than weaker). Above anything else, the weaker peso is a sign of weaker confidence in the Philippine economy. And the longer it takes for the Marcos administration to go after (and even jail) the corrupt, the longer it will take for business confidence to recover, and the more capital will want to flee the country. The peso’s fate is in the hands of Marcos himself. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of False Nostalgia: The Marcos “Golden Age” Myths and How to Debunk Them.

"MANILA, Philippines – We talk about self-care a lot, but many of us don’t see it for what it really is. Type “self-care” on any search engine, and you’ll find the usual advice meshed with more glamorous ones: move your body, do a quick makeover, journal, eat a balanced diet, go on a shopping spree, take a warm bath, sleep eight hours, or book a “wellness getaway” for the weekend. But is there more to self-care that we tend to overlook? Self-care isn’t always pretty, and it isn’t meant to be. It’s also intended to be uncomfortable, real, and vulnerable. Let’s unpack what the “ugly” side of self-care truly means, just like how we peel onions — raw and sometimes stinging — with the help of Marie Angelica Paz, a registered guidance counselor and licensed psychologist. Pop culture — and capitalism — sell the idea that we should book our next trip as soon as possible, follow a 10-step skincare routine, or check out everything in our cart to find relaxation and joy in our lives. Self-care is being commodified, and we’re falling for it. Paz told Rappler that surface-level practices are not inherently wrong, but they can be counterproductive if they don’t align with one’s values or if they are done mainly for clout or aesthetics. Indulgent fixes can be confused with real healing or fulfillment. “It’s called self-care, pero if you’re doing it for flex, nawawala ‘yung idea ng ‘self’ doon. Para saan ba talaga ‘yang ginagawa mo (It’s called self-care, but if you’re doing it for flex, the idea of ‘self’ gets lost. What are you really doing it for)?” she told Rappler. Performative self-care can distract us from real emotional work, especially when we engage in too many activities yet still feel lost. Another downside of this idea is that it can be alienating for those who cannot afford them or those who don’t have access to the same resources. Surface-level self-care doesn’t address deeper emotional wounds. This is where inner work, also known as shadow work, comes in. It offers opportunities for individuals to come to terms with parts of themselves that are beneath the surface. This is when we unearth the pains we have repressed for so long. The process can be ugly and messy because it’s when imperfections usually reveal themselves. This is when it starts to hurt the most. “When you do inner work, it’s important to get to know parts of yourself that are not easy to accept or embrace. That’s why it takes a lot of care. When one feels invalidated, there can be resistance or denial,” Paz said. Emotional work demands self-accountability, which is why it’s often avoided. Many face the question: What role have I played in my own suffering? And as a therapist, Paz feels responsible for bringing the client back to reality by helping them face hard truths. She admits that she cannot always validate her clients, or she risks enabling unhealthy behavior. At its core, self-care means taking full responsibility for securing our personal wellness. “It is when you take the initiative to address your needs holistically, in line with your values or according to what matters to you most,” Paz expressed. What we don’t always realize is that self-care requires hard work. Others tend to choose the relatively easy fixes over the more complicated ones, like setting boundaries or taking accountability, because they’re not ready to deal with the emotional work the latter requires. Paz further explained that there’s nothing wrong with having things easy, but if we succumb to self-indulgence, we can lose the chance to be truly responsible for our well-being. For Paz, we can use self-care to nurture our appetite for life by starting with the basics. Number one on the list is sleep and rest. “Your body needs time to recover, just like how your phone needs charging after use. Sleep is the body’s way of recharging. Even in your busiest time, sleep should be the last thing you sacrifice,” the psychologist explained. Second is exercise. She highlighted that our bodies are meant to be moving and compared it to stagnant water, which can be toxic when left unattended over a period of time. Third is food intake. Others eat to “take care” of themselves, but are not mindful of what they consume. As part of self-care, we need to check whether our bodies are getting proper nourishment. In some cases, however, even the basics may not be feasible. That’s why there’s no foolproof playbook for self-care. Living conditions, societal norms, socioeconomic factors, and support systems could all play a role. But as Paz said, starting with what’s easy and available goes a long way. Once it catches meaning, that’s our gateway to doing something more for ourselves. Seeking professional help should be the next step when one still struggles despite addressing basic needs. This is especially true for high-functioning individuals, who tend to juggle too much and lose balance. Paz also noted those who are born with mental health conditions. “It’s difficult to make sense of a situation, kapag ‘yung guidelines ng mundo is ‘yung nasa norms. There are extreme cases, those in the outliers, and they need extra help in processing things (It’s difficult to make sense of a situation when the world uses the norms as guidelines. There are extreme cases, those in the outliers, and they need extra help in processing things),” she said. Therapy can help individuals thrive despite mental health challenges. However, access to it remains a challenge. It can be expensive, so how can someone earning a barely livable wage avail of it? Moreover, even if the system improves and the state subsidizes the fees, there are not enough mental health professionals in the country. Stigma and misconceptions continue to exist. In her practice, Paz has noticed that the older generations still view therapy as something embarrassing or something only “crazy” people do. There is a growing appeal among the younger generations — they even view going to therapy as a status symbol — but Paz finds this romanticization alarming. As a mental health professional, it’s good news if her clients no longer need therapy. She also shared her concern about some people using mental health as an excuse. They fake symptoms to escape accountability, and it doesn’t help the cause. Ultimately, Paz reminds us that when it comes to self-care, it’s a myth that things always come easily. We have to proactively approach it until it becomes a part of our lifestyle. We have to commit to it despite the discomfort or struggle. “Hindi puwedeng palagi kang komportable (You can’t be comfortable all the time). As my favorite proverb goes, ‘Sunshine all the time makes a desert.’ It’s about balancing everything. Nothing in itself is purely good or bad. It all comes to how you’re gonna balance everything. Even if something is not appealing, you have to think that maybe it’s what is necessary for you to grow,” she expressed. After unpacking self-care layer by layer, what remains is the hope that if we move past the surface and push through the messy, stinging parts of the process, we’ll eventually be rewarded with a sweeter taste of life. When life gives you onions, peel the layers like your life depends on it — and turn them into something that truly nourishes your body, mind, and spirit. – Rappler.com",True,true,The ‘ugly’ side of self-care: What a therapist wants you to know about it,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/ugly-side-self-care-therapists-advice/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Inflation eased to 1.5% in November as the rise of vegetable and meat prices slowed, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said on Friday, November 5. The latest inflation print brings the average rate for 2025 to 1.6%, still below the government’s target range of 2% to 4%. Deputy National Statistician Divina Gracia del Prado said inflation of food and non-alcoholic beverages fell to just 0.1% in November. For vegetables in particular, inflation dropped to 4% from 16.4% in October, while for meat, inflation slowed to 4.2% from 5.2%. But “other pelagic fish,” which ranked as the top contributor to the overall November figure, saw higher inflation of 13% from 11.7%, driven by galunggong (round scad) prices that went up due to the recent tropical cyclones that hit the country. “Naapektuhan din siya, so we have a scarcity of galunggong kaya mataas din ‘yung price niya,” Del Prado said. (The supply was affected, so we have a scarcity of round scad and that’s why its prices are currently high.) Del Prado also noted that inflation of beans jumped from -12% in October to 12.4% in November. Prices of onions and shallots have also been trending upward, recording an even higher 48.2% inflation rate from the already elevated 34.9%. In Metro Manila, inflation slightly eased to 2.8% from 2.9% the prior month. Regions outside Metro Manila also saw a similar slowdown to 1.2% from 1.3%. Central Visayas recorded the fastest inflation rate at 3.3% while the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao saw continuous deflation or negative inflation at -1.4%. Deflation means price levels are decreasing. Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan attributed the slowdown to the Marcos administration’s efforts to strengthen the food supply chain and ensure food security. “The sustained moderation in inflation reflects our commitment to protect consumers and strengthen our economic resilience against global and domestic headwinds. We will continue implementing timely, well-coordinated policies to keep prices stable and ensure progress is felt by every Filipino,” the country’s chief economist said. DEPDev added that the Department of Agriculture has issued guidelines to safeguard the country against African swine fever while facilitating safe pork imports. These include the recognition of ASF-free zones within accredited exporting countries. Executive Secretary Ralph Recto also said the latest inflation print will give the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) more room for another rate cut in its final monetary policy meeting of the year on Thursday, December 11. Apart from the BSP’s monetary policy meeting, the Development Budget Coordination Committee is also set to discuss the country’s economic growth and inflation targets on Tuesday, December 9. – Tatiana Maligro, with reports from Arriane dela Cruz/Rappler.com Arriane dela Cruz is a Rappler intern.

"When we plan trips to other countries, the most popular destinations are no longer the first places we immediately flock to. Tokyo in Japan, Shanghai in China, and Seoul in South Korea — spots often featured in travel brochures because they’ve been visited countless times by countless people over the years — prove time and time again why they’re so popular in the first place. Travelers nowadays are changing, though. With the days of post-COVID revenge traveling being long gone, people are now booking trips to lesser known places, and diving into activities you probably would have never considered visiting another country for. Even in major cities, the attention shifts to cafes in secluded residential areas, novelty shops that have been around for decades but are only just beginning to be discovered, and bustling hawker stalls that are kept alive by nearby office workers and students. “People are looking further away from destinations they’re comfortable with. Even if they might go to Tokyo, they are no longer staying in Shinjuku and Shibuya and Ginza, the usual places. They’re going a little further and further,” Klook’s chief commercial officer Wilfred Fan told Rappler. The main culprit — or catalyst, rather — lies in the palms of our hands: social media. According to data from Klook’s Travel Pulse, 80% of Gen Zs and 78% of millennials are putting on their itinerary experiences they just came across on social media. It wasn’t through a thick guidebook that they thought to get a chibi portrait of themselves done at a night market in Bangkok. It was likely through a traveler who happened to stumble upon the experience during their trip, and decided to share it in the form of a short video on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, or Instagram. It’s a classic cycle, really. We discover an activity, we consider if it’s what we want to do, we make the purchase, then we share all about our experiences. And repeat. Experiences are key now. Travelers aren’t only going to temples and art museums to experience a country’s culture — they’re also beginning to explore in the same way as people who have lived there all their lives. “If you’re talking about big theme parks, you actually don’t have to market it. However, if you’re talking about something like a traditional jeans making workshop in Japan, nobody will know that it exists. Nobody will go and search for it. They will only know about it because they went on social media. Either they are scrolling and [they see it], or they search for interesting things to do in Japan and it’s one of the videos that pops up,” Marcus Yong, Klook’s vice president for global marketing, told Rappler. Travelers are now dipping their toes into niche activities like tea tasting ceremonies, renting cultural garb for a day, or even going on wellness retreats. They may not be able to keep a tangible souvenir from these experiences, but will it really matter at the end of the day if you’re coming home with irreplaceable memories anyway? It’s also through this cycle that hidden gems no longer remain under the radar. Places that are usually referred to as “second cities” (think Sa Pa in Vietnam and Hiroshima in Japan) are becoming people’s first choices. They’re places that wouldn’t immediately be at the top of your mind if someone were to ask you to name cities from a tourism-friendly country, but in 2025, they’re climbing their way to the top. It’s a welcome change — one that puts on the map destinations that are just as rich in culture and history, but just had yet to be talked about by more people. For instance, I was able to explore Tomonoura, a quaint fishing port town in Hiroshima prefecture that inspired the Studio Ghibli movie Ponyo. Years ago, if I were to put together my own itinerary for Japan, it probably would not have even made it on the list. I would have stuck to wherever everyone else had gone. It’s content creators who are leading the charge, too. They go out there to show what a new place has to offer — all in a matter of a minute-long video at that. Things aren’t as simple as just stitching chronological clips of a travel destination. With the dwindling attention span of social media users, they only have about three seconds to hook their viewers and show them why this destination that goes off the beaten path deserves a spot in their itinerary. Content creator Alvin, who runs Just Got Fed on Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram, can attest to this. A post shared by Just Got Fed | travel • food • stories (@justgotfed) “I think sa social media ngayon, everybody wants to showcase a different experience sa napanood nila. ‘Pag pupunta ka ng Hong Kong, hindi ko naman siya mashoshowcase kung Disneyland lang. So, hahanap ako ng iba, or mag-eexplore ako ng iba. Kaya what I want to showcase most is yung mga kakaibang areas, and kakaibang places apart from the common ones,” shared Alvin, adding that it’s the video hooks that are crucial. (On social media nowadays, everyone wants to showcase an experience that’s different from what they usually see. If you’re going to Hong Kong, I can’t just showcase what it has to offer if I just focus on Disneyland. So, I look for something else, or explore other places. That’s why what I want to showcase most are the unique areas, and unique places apart from the common ones.) Just as travelers rely on social media for destination recommendations, it’s becoming an outlet for them to ease their pre-trip anxieties, too. Videos on how to not get offloaded by immigration are usually sure viral hits, and so are video guides for getting your visa approved. But for those traveling for the first time, Alvin’s best piece of advice is to always, always plan ahead. “Hindi lang itinerary. Check the requirements, check all the limitations. Kasi once you travel, there are different cultures and different rules. So being familiar with that would make your trip easier… Sa Philippines mismo, ang dami nating kailangan na visa. Be prepared sa mga requirements kasi doon naman talaga ‘yung first barrier mo before you travel,” Alvin told Rappler. (Not just your itinerary. Check the requirements, check all the limitations. Because once you travel, there are different cultures and different rules. So being familiar with that would make your trip easier… In the Philippines, we need so many visas. Be prepared with the requirements because visas are your first barrier before you travel anyway.) It goes without saying that modern travel really has changed. People don’t flock to what’s popular as often anymore, short-form videos are king, and the value of experience are what people look for when exploring a new place. All these, it seems, are here to stay. – Rappler.com",True,true,Modern travelers aren’t going for popular destinations anymore.

"MANILA, Philippines – Western Union on Wednesday, October 1, launched a new mobile app in the Philippines that allows users not only to send but also to request money from abroad — a first for the global money transfer company. The app enables consumers to send funds overseas through Western Union’s global financial network, which connects billions of bank accounts, millions of digital wallets and cards, and hundreds of thousands of retail locations. Users can pay online using the national QR code system, QR Ph, and track transactions via the app’s Money Transfer Control Number (MTCN). Filipino users can also request remittances from senders in countries such as the United States, Australia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. Funds can then be received via cash pickup, bank deposit, or digital wallet transfer, with an option to redirect incoming remittances to preferred accounts. “Today’s launch marks an important milestone in our effort to serve consumers in the Philippines better and connect them to their families and loved ones across the world,” said Gregory Laurent, Western Union vice president for the Philippines, Japan, Australia, New Zealand & Pacific Islands. “Our new app gives the opportunity to do both, with the flexibility and trust that Western Union can provide.” The Philippines is Western Union’s first market globally to feature both send and request capabilities in one app. According to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, remittances to the Philippines hit a record high of $38 billion in 2024, with the World Bank ranking the country fourth among low- and middle-income nations in remittance inflows. The United States and Singapore were the top sources of cash remittances last year.

"A trowel (/ˈtraʊ.əl/), in the hands of an archaeologist, is like a trusty sidekick – a tiny, yet mighty, instrument that uncovers ancient secrets, one well-placed scoop at a time. It’s the Sherlock Holmes of the excavation site, revealing clues about the past with every delicate swipe. Standing above the cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde National Park, my son Leka asked, “What do you think the people who lived here did every day, Dad?” The question pulled me back to my own childhood, when I first encountered these places through grainy photos in a children’s encyclopedia in the Philippines. Back then, the stone rooms carved into cliffs felt distant and unfamiliar, more like curiosities than places where real people once lived ordinary lives. I told Leka what archaeology has taught me over the years. People here lived much as we do. They worried about food. They cared for family. They watched the weather, dealt with drought and danger, and made choices under uncertainty. The cliffs offered protection, but daily life unfolded far beyond the stone walls, across fields, water sources, trails, and neighboring communities. These were not static or vanished societies. They were indigenous communities making decisions, adapting to change, and shaping their futures in ways that still matter today. Archaeological work shows that Ancestral Pueblo communities began settling the Mesa Verde region around AD 600, building deep knowledge of farming, architecture, and movement across the landscape. The cliff dwellings themselves appeared much later, mainly in the 12th and early 13th centuries. When prolonged droughts placed pressure on crops and water, people chose to move. This was not collapse or failure. It was reorganization. Descendant Pueblo communities remain connected to these places, reminding us that Mesa Verde is not just a ruin but part of a living indigenous history. Our family has made a habit of these road trips, piling into the car to visit national parks and historic sites. They are moments we share together, but they are also how our children learn about the world. Walking through these places allows history and environment to come alive, not as stories sealed in textbooks or documentaries, but as landscapes shaped by human decisions over time. Growing up in the Philippines, I encountered places like Mesa Verde only through books or films. The country has extraordinary cultural landscapes and ecological diversity, yet many of these places remain difficult to experience in ways that help young people connect history, culture, environment, and everyday life. This gap appears in small but telling ways. Some recently promoted “heritage” attractions illustrate how easily good intentions can slide into display without context. Many such places attract attention and visitors, reflecting a desire to connect with history. At the same time, heritage can drift away from historical understanding when interpretation and sustained educational engagement are limited or non-existent. When this happens, complex histories risk being reduced to visual appeal rather than understood as lived experiences shaped over time. When interpretation remains shallow, visits often center on photo-taking rather than learning. Sites become backdrops for images rather than places for asking questions. This does not reflect a lack of curiosity, but a lack of guidance. Without accessible narratives and educational framing, visitors are left with images instead of understanding, and the deeper histories of decision-making and social life remain out of view. This contrast becomes more apparent when set alongside how heritage has been supported institutionally elsewhere. In the United States, the national park system was built through legislation and an explicit commitment to public education. Even as that foundation is increasingly contested today, it shows how heritage can be treated as a public good rather than a discretionary expense. Interpretation, research, and access are understood as part of stewardship. The Philippines already has important foundations that could support a similar approach. These include the National Integrated Protected Areas System and laws protecting cultural heritage, and participation in the UNESCO World Heritage. These can provide a framework for treating natural and cultural landscapes as shared national responsibilities, guided by research and public engagement. The challenge lies in turning these frameworks into sustained, meaningful practice on the ground. The Philippines has many places that could be approached in this way. The Agusan Marsh holds long histories of river-based life and seasonal movement. The Tabon Caves and their surrounding landscapes connect archaeology, ecology, and maritime worlds. In Bicol, the terrain shaped by Mayon Volcano tells stories of settlement, farming, eruption, and recovery across centuries. These places document how people have lived with uncertainty and change, not simply as scenic backdrops. For places like these to connect meaningfully with the present, archaeology also has to change how it speaks. Too often, the past is framed as a story of loss or collapse. That framing creates distance and makes history feel finished. When we shift attention to how people managed resources and made collective decisions under pressure, the past becomes easier to relate to. It becomes a record of problem-solving rather than disappearance. When Leka asked what people did every day at Mesa Verde, he was really asking how people lived with uncertainty and how they made choices in changing environments. That is exactly the kind of question archaeology can help us ask. The Philippines has the landscapes and the lived experience to create places where young people can ask those same questions of their own pasts. Heritage is often treated as secondary when daily survival feels more urgent, when the pressure to put food on the table makes conservation seem like a luxury. Yet landscapes and histories carry knowledge about how people have endured scarcity and managed risk. When heritage is approached as education rather than as a decoration, and as a shared responsibility rather than a constraint, it can help guide how tourism and development are shaped. Creating spaces that connect history, land, ecology, and lived experience provides the next generation more than information. It gives them perspective, and a way to think about how their own choices will shape the future. – Rappler.com Stephen B.

"When the world went silent in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, dancing and music at Ballet Manila did not stop — it simply moved online. While theaters across the country closed their doors, the company founded and led by the Philippines’ first prima ballerina, Lisa Macuja-Elizalde, found a new rhythm in the virtual space. “During the pandemic, we transitioned to online classes out of necessity,” Macuja-Elizalde tells Rappler. “But it turned out to be a blessing. We gained students from all over the world — people logged in to take ballet classes online.” The Lisa Macuja School of Ballet, the official training school of Ballet Manila, became an unexpected digital stage, connecting young dancers from Manila to Malaysia, Indonesia, and beyond. Even after restrictions were lifted, the company decided to keep this model alive. “We still have hybrid classes now — online and on-site at the same time,” she shares. “It allows us to stay connected with our international students, and I even get to see many of them in person when I travel to conduct workshops and masterclasses abroad.” The shift not only sustained Ballet Manila through the pandemic, it widened its reach and influence in ways few classical dance institutions had imagined possible. Resilience, however, has always been a defining trait of Ballet Manila. Before the pandemic, the company had already faced trials that would have crushed most performing arts groups. In 2019, just before a scheduled performance of Giselle, a massive fire gutted the Star City compound, home to Aliw and Star Theaters, Ballet Manila’s home stage for about two decades. The fire damaged Aliw Theater, a loss that deeply affected Ballet Manila. “We were homeless for a long time,” Macuja-Elizalde recalls. “Then the pandemic happened. And after that, a typhoon.” Yet, rather than retreat, Ballet Manila rebuilt itself — physically and spiritually. “Bouncing back from that kind of nothingness wasn’t easy,” she says. “But we continued. We kept teaching, performing online, and finding ways to bring ballet to people even when the world was shut down.” That perseverance has since paid off. The company’s dancers — now a 42-member ensemble, including 22 women and 20 men — are once again filling the Aliw Theater with movement and music. “We came back with more energy, more purpose,” she says. “When you lose something so important and get it back, you value it even more.” Among the brightest symbols of Ballet Manila’s recent rebirth is Florante at Laura, a full-length ballet adaptation of Francisco Balagtas’ 19th-century epic. The production first premiered in 2024 as part of Macuja-Elizalde’s 60th birthday celebration and returned this year for a limited run from October 3 to 5, complete with a live orchestra conducted by Toma Cayabyab, son of National Artist Ryan Cayabyab. “The ballet is close to my heart,” she says. “It’s a Filipino classic, and I want it to be performed often so that every generation of audiences can experience it.” Everything in Florante at Laura is original — the music, libretto, and choreography. Ryan Cayabyab composed and orchestrated the score, while Michael Coroza served as librettist and consultant. The choreography was crafted by Martin Lawrance and Gerardo Francisco Jr., both long-time collaborators of Ballet Manila. For Cayabyab, the process of creating the score was a journey guided entirely by story and emotion. “The inspiration really came from the story itself and the way it was structured,” he tells Rappler. “I didn’t begin with a theme in mind — I let the narrative lead me. The story always tells me what kind of material or emotion is needed for each scene.” When the ballet required Middle Eastern or Persian influences, Cayabyab dove into research. He said he studied traditional Persian music and discovered it often uses harmonic minor scales. “I wanted listeners to feel transported to that region and era,” he shares. “For the European scenes, I added touches of Spanish and Moorish dance music. Everything had to match the characters, setting, and mood of the story.” The result is a sweeping, rhythm-driven score designed for movement. “Ballet music must give dancers rhythm,” Cayabyab explains. “I built rhythmic contrasts — slower, lyrical sections for love scenes, and more dissonant harmonies for conflict or politics. Everything I know about musical storytelling went into it.” Amazingly, Cayabyab completed the entire score in just two to three weeks. “That’s how I usually work,” he laughs. “Once I start, I don’t stop until I finish. The choreography and staging were developed after the score — it all began with the music.” For Macuja-Elizalde, the collaboration was proof that Filipino artistry could match the grandest of productions anywhere in the world. “The music, the story, the choreography — it’s all Filipino,” she says proudly. “It’s a modern retelling, but rooted in our own culture and artistry. It’s exactly what Ballet Manila stands for.” That identity — a fusion of Russian discipline and Filipino soul — defines Ballet Manila’s artistic style. Macuja-Elizalde herself trained under the Vaganova system in Russia during the 1980s, a time when the country was still under communist rule. “The four years I spent in Russia changed me completely,” she recalls. “I learned discipline, hard work, and simplicity. The Vaganova technique gave me the strength and foundation to dance the great classical roles.” Today, that same rigor forms the backbone of Ballet Manila’s training. “The Russian style gives the dancer strength and precision,” she says. “But Filipino dancers bring something special, they dance every performance as if it’s their last. There’s so much emotion and passion. That combination is what makes Ballet Manila unique.” It’s a philosophy that breathes life into both classical and contemporary productions. In 2025 alone, Ballet Manila’s lineup includes The Pearl Gala in March, Swan Lake in May, Don Quixote in August, and Florante at Laura in October. Abroad, the company continues its regional tours with Cinderella in Kuala Lumpur and Snow White in Taiwan and Indonesia. The Snow White Holiday Cheer Series will close the year in December. Even with a demanding schedule, Ballet Manila’s mission remains the same: “to bring ballet to the people and more people to the ballet.” One of the most meaningful ways Ballet Manila fulfills that mission is through Project Ballet Futures, a scholarship program under the Lisa Macuja School of Ballet. The initiative offers free training and equipment to talented young dancers, especially those who may not have the means to pursue formal ballet education. “We audition students around 10 to 12 years old and give them full scholarships,” explains Macuja-Elizalde, who founded Ballet Manila in 1995 with Osias Barroso. “Some drop out along the way, but many stay and grow into professional dancers. In fact, many of our company members today started in Project Ballet Futures.” The program is open to both Filipino and international students, whether they study on-site or online. “The goal is to make ballet accessible,” she says. “Talent can come from anywhere.” The company also conducts outreach performances and student matinees—programs that often serve as the first introduction to ballet for many children. “Just this week (in the week of October 3 to 5), we had a student matinee of Florante at Laura for university students,” Macuja-Elizalde shares. “They were clapping, cheering, completely engaged. Afterward, some said, ‘Now we understand the story of Florante at Laura.’ That’s the power of performance, it connects people to our own stories.” For Macuja-Elizalde, the mission goes beyond entertainment, it’s about cultivating culture. “When people go to the ballet as naturally as going to the movies or a concert, that’s when we know we’ve made progress,” she says. Over the years, she’s seen audiences evolve. “I meet people who tell me, ‘I watched you perform when I was in elementary school, and now I’m bringing my kids to watch Ballet Manila,’” she shares. “That’s very rewarding. It means the cycle of appreciation continues.” Despite fire, storms, and a global pandemic, Ballet Manila continues to pirouette forward — graceful but unyielding. From rebuilding its theater to nurturing dancers across borders, the company embodies the same resilience that has defined its founder’s life on and off stage. “Every time we rise again,” Macuja -Elizalde says with a smile, “We are reminded why we do this — to share beauty, discipline, and the joy of dance. Ballet teaches you to fall, to stand up, and to keep dancing. And that’s what Ballet Manila will always do.” – Rappler.com Jinji Abaño is a business writer and a lover of the arts.

"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines is home not only to thousands of islands, but also to the many mythological creatures believed to inhabit them. While many Filipinos are familiar with the tree-dwelling kapre, the mischievous duwende, and especially the bloodthirsty aswang, there are also quite a few lesser-known ones — creatures both feared and revered, all born from the same soil that remembers our roots as Filipinos. If you think that only the Greeks have centaurs, then you haven’t heard of this mythological creature from Batangas. The anggitay is an ethereal amalgam of a woman’s face and upper body, a mare’s lower body, and a unicorn-like horn on its forehead. This is not to be mistaken for a tikbalang, which possesses a horse’s head and hooves and is commonly known to be a mischievous trickster who likes to mislead travelers and play tricks on human senses. Other depictions of the tikbalang paint it as a creature that abducts and mistreats children and women. The anggitay is believed to be the opposite, and supposedly helps guide lost travelers back to the right path. It is most associated with collecting precious jewels and gemstones, mirroring their intrinsic connection with the land. However, it is known to be elusive to humans, and is said to often only appear on a bright yet rainy day. If you hear a faint squeaking sound on the street after a midnight shower, it means a karkarison is in the vicinity — and someone in that street is said to fall ill and die the next day. The karkarison is a small cart pulled by a headless bull and ridden by three or four headless, woman-like figures. During epidemics, it roams through villages spreading disease. Otherwise, it only makes rare appearances, and is said to travel from one haunted tree to another before vanishing. Haunted trees are believed to be the resting places of the karkarison and other spirits. Villagers often light fires nearby and throw bones into the flames to keep these creatures away. Other preventive measures include placing rice-chaff smudges by house gates and under staircases, and drawing white crosses with lime on doors and posts. The pasatsat’s story was born out of the trauma suffered by Filipinos during the Japanese occupation. As Filipinos then could barely keep up with the cost of living, they didn’t have the means to honor the dead properly, either. Some families wrapped their deceased loved ones’ bodies in a banig (mat) instead of giving them a proper burial. The pasatsat, said to have originated in Pangasinan, often reveals itself to passersby on deserted paths as a corpse in a rolled up banig. It’s believed to be the spirit of a person who died or was killed during World War II. The word comes from the Pangasinense word “satsat,” which means “punit” (rip) — alluding to the idea of needing to stab the banig for it to disappear. As the body never shows itself, one of the only indicators of its lingering presence is the smell of decay. While many Filipino mythical beings are depicted as violent or malevolent, the lampong is deemed less hostile, and perhaps even friendly, due to its duty to protect and preserve. Among the Ilongot of Northeast Luzon, the lampong’s purpose is to defend wild animals. It’s often known to take the form of one among its flock or metamorphose into a white one-eyed deer, watching over them and even distracting or diverting preying hunters. A hunter’s first five shots are said to always miss the lampong. But when it finally pierces through, the hunter’s strength will begin to fade day by day until he dies at last. Could anything be more bone-chilling than a manananggal flapping its wings across the night sky? Turns out, there is. The sangkabagi resembles a grim reaper on a flying boat, in search of souls to carry and transport to the realm of the dead. Legends say the sangkabagi snatched people as they slept and fed on livers to fill the wounds with herbs. They allegedly command termites or weevils to destroy the clothes, rice, corn, and seeds of anyone who has wronged them. However, some accounts noted that the sangkabagi were antagonized by Spanish colonizers and were originally known to be helpful — guiding the dead to the afterlife, healing the sick, and even gifting their dearest friends a magical book that allows them to travel anywhere in an instant. These are only some of the many Filipino folklore creatures that may have been forgotten, but continue to exist in our memories and in the stories that we tell.

In a statement on Friday, October 17, the groups backed proposed reforms to the bank secrecy deposit law and the Foreign Currency Deposit Act. The statement was signed by the following groups: The groups described the two laws as “straitjackets” for regulators that prevented them from being more efficient in tasks such as investigating and prosecuting those involved in corruption and money laundering. The groups also believe the laws have severely restricted the Philippines’ country’s financial and economic stability. The proposed amendments to the bank secrecy law allows the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to examine deposits when its Monetary Board finds reason to suspect bank officials and employees or those tied to BSP-supervised financial institutions are involved in fraud. “By empowering regulators and enforcement agencies with the authority to investigate corruption, tax evasion, and other illicit economic activities, the reforms will help ensure integrity across both public and private financial systems,” they wrote. In a blog post by BSP Deputy Governor Mamerto Tangonan, Assistant Governor Maria Margarita Debuque-Gonzales, and Currency Policy and Integrity Head Eloisa Glindro, the officials called for the easing of bank secrecy laws to curb corruption. “Easing bank secrecy — with appropriate safeguards — would empower investigators to trace illicit funds, match deposits to asset declarations, and build prosecutable cases. Unlike demonetization, which imposes broad costs on the public, transparency reform targets corruption at its source,” the officials wrote. The three officials of the monetary authority also described calls to demonetize the P1,000 and P500 bills as a blunt and high-cost instrument against corruption. Their remarks come after former finance secretary Cesar Purisima called for the phaseout of P1,000 and P500 bills amid claims that billions in public funds were delivered to the homes of Leyte 1st District Representative Martin Romualdez and former Ako Bicol representative Zaldy Co. The three BSP officials also called for complementary measures to curb corruption such as the following: Business groups also strongly support Ombudsman Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla’s decision to restore public access to officials’ Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net worth (SALN). The groups believe that lifting the Duterte-era restriction will reinforce the constitutional principle that accountability is key to maintaining citizens’ confidence in their public institutions. They also underscored the importance of good governance in boosting the confidence of local and foreign investors. “When governance systems are predictable and information is accessible, the risks of corruption and policy uncertainty decrease, lowering the cost of doing business. This attracts sustained capital inflows, promotes fair competition, and contributes to stronger, more resilient economic growth,” they said. – Rappler.com",True,true,"PH business groups back bank secrecy reforms, restoring SALN access",https://www.rappler.com/business/business-groups-support-bank-secrecy-reforms-restore-saln-access/,Rappler
"BAGUIO, Philippines – The first night of December always hits differently in Baguio, but this year, it felt like the city took one deep breath and exhaled pure Christmas magic. Before sunset, people began lining Session Road. By 4:30 pm, the Baguio police estimated the crowd at 30,000, including the hundreds set to join the Saint Louis University Lantern Parade. It was not chaos. Rather, it was community – the very Baguio way of filling every curb, step, and ledge with anticipation. When the lights flickered on, the crowd’s collective gasp said it all. The Upper Session Road Christmas tree was towering and seemed alive. Built largely from bamboo and softened with layers of Peruvian ferns, red and Chinese poinsettias, lemon pine, and vincas as ground cover, it felt like a tribute to Baguio’s plantitas (people who love plants and gardening) and every green thumb who has ever whispered, “Kaya ko ’yan alagaan (I can grow that).” The city government decided this year’s decorations should be organic, indigenous, and kinder to the environment, producing less waste after the season and more beauty rooted in nature. Even the Botanical Garden followed suit with local flowers and natural elements. Credit goes to the artists and craftsmen like Resty Lopez, Joey Quinio, Reydon Amking, and James Calicdan whose hands shaped the tree into something that looks grown, not built. The program opened with the familiar sound of the UB Rondalla, instantly setting a homegrown celebratory tone. UB Voices and Graces soon lifted the mood higher with doxology, hymns, and carols. The city’s leaders offered messages rooted in gratitude, unity, and the meaning of light. Mayor Benjamin Magalong’s words echoed through the crowd: “Ang tunay na Pasko ay hindi nasusukat sa garbo o dami ng dekorasyon. Nasusukat ito sa kabutihan ng puso – sa ating pagpapatawad, pag-unawa, at sa liwanag na kaya nating ibahagi sa isa’t isa.” (Christmas is not measured by grandeur or the number of decorations. It is measured by the goodness of the heart, by our forgiveness, understanding, and the light we can share with one another.) Then, in a 10-second countdown and a roar from the crowd, Baguio lit up. The tree burst into color, and fireworks from SM City Baguio drenched the sky in gold and ember, reflecting off dramatic December clouds that seemed as ready for the season as everyone else. The weather wasn’t perfect, but the night was. Immediately after the fireworks, the crowd turned to the 17th Saint Louis University Lantern Parade, a tradition that draws thousands each year. Silk lanterns swayed, glowing floats rolled past, students danced in coordinated costumes, and thousands of phones captured every passing light. Color, culture, and creativity swept through Session Road. This year, the parade became a world tour of light festivals, each represented in artistic displays by an SLU school. Lanterns inspired by Germany and the Netherlands glowed in the evening breeze. Vietnam’s Hội An Lantern Festival was also recreated, while Myanmar’s Tazaungdaing Festival of Lights appeared in crafted lanterns and floats. Australia’s Moon Lantern Trail shimmered alongside Thailand’s Yi Peng Festival. Lanterns evoking South Korea’s Seoul Festival and Japan’s Nagasaki Festival floated past. The parade also showed vibrant representations of India’s Diwali. When the parade ended, Session Road still hummed with laughter and conversation. The glow of the evening lingered, the kind of warmth you carry home after a perfect night. Walking back toward Cathedral Loop, it felt as if December had officially arrived. The Christmas tree was greener than ever. The city was bathed in lights. The parade had “crisscrossed” continents, bringing distant cultures into Baguio’s streets. And the community had shown up once again for moments that truly matter. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Baguio breathes Christmas: Lights, lanterns, and a city alive",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/luzon/baguio-breathes-christmas-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Ask a chef where their culinary inspiration comes from, and many may recall a childhood dish tied to a warm memory, a mother’s regional specialty, a mentor, or a street food vendor they met on their travels. For many chefs, inspiration is borrowed from a special place, a person, or a fleeting moment with a permanent impact. But for Chef Francis Tolentino, inspiration comes from something more elemental: the ground we stand on, the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the earth beneath our feet. At Taupe, located in Bonifacio Global City, Tolentino channels the “elements” in his third tasting menu. Newly recognized by the Michelin Guide Philippines in October, Tolentino is soaring with post-award pride yet keeps his feet firmly grounded, anchored by Taupe’s vision of balancing creativity with traditional techniques and a deep respect for local ingredients. The elements are also his compass, drawing from the smokiness of fire, the lightness of air, the flow of water, and the slowness of earth. “I wanted to go deeper into the fundamentals this time around. Air, water, fire, earth. How does each one influence the way we cook and taste food?” Tolentino told Rappler. “It wasn’t just about using these elements as inspiration but about finding balance between nature and technique. I asked myself: how can we transform an ingredient while still respecting its essence? That became the foundation of the menu.” Tolentino embraces modern culinary techniques such as dry-aging, fermentation, smoking, and freezing. But for him, dry ice isn’t just for dramatic effect, nor is tableside blowtorching a mere performance. These methods are intentionally chosen to reveal the humble depth of each ingredient he champions — from calamansi snow, fermented guava, to charcoal-burnt meringue. Taupe doesn’t scream fine dining to the point of intimidation. Catch Tolentino at the marble counter in the front of the pass, overseeing his line cooks as they calmly and coolly add the finishing touches to the course. Here, he is in his element, setting each dish underneath the warming lights with confidence and ease. Chef is right beside them, sharing a laugh or casual banter with his staff. As Tolentino’s first fine dining concept heads toward another year, the Filipino chef has learned that fine dining isn’t just about the food — it’s about building trust with the guests. “I’ve learned that they come back not only for the dishes but for the story and the experience. Moving into our third year, I want to be more confident in our identity while still pushing myself and the team to evolve. The lesson is: stay grounded, but don’t stop moving forward.” Tolentino had been working for casual dining, bars, hotel kitchens, and cafés in the past before deciding to pursue fine dining in 2024. He knew that he still wanted to celebrate Filipino flavors and ingredients, but with a global approach. Years of traveling across Asia and the West provided the modern culinary techniques, but his love for the Philippines keeps the heart and soul of each ingredient at the center of each menu. His childhood days in the province of Nueva Ecija, where he paired suman or sticky rice with grilled pork, still find their way in his dishes. The name of his restaurant, Taupe, reveals the mindset behind the food. “Taupe is my canvas, where I express my passion for elevating Philippine ingredients into an art form. It’s a place where the love for my homeland’s produce and my favorite global flavors come together to create culinary masterpieces,” he said. With the Michelin Guide finally recognizing restaurants in the Philippines, Tolentino is ecstatic. Taupe was awarded Michelin Selection recognition, putting Tolentino’s philosophy on the map, where familiar ingredients are given a contemporary but refined and warm approach. “It’s a big deal because it puts our food culture on the global stage and highlights the talent, passion, and hard work of so many Filipino chefs and restaurateurs,” he told Rappler. “I think this will have a huge impact on tourism. Food has always been a big part of our culture, and now, more people might travel here just to experience our dining scene.” He told Rappler that with his dishes, he wants people to think of it as comfort food at its core, beyond the innovative iterations and intricate presentations. Food that is nothing too gastronomically alien or extravagant, but dishes that guests wouldn’t mind ordering à la carte another time. “For chefs and restaurant owners, this definitely raises the bar. It’s great motivation to keep pushing for excellence, but at the end of the day, what really matters is staying true to who we are — cooking with heart, telling stories through our food, and making people happy.” For his current menu, Tolentino utilizes the elements in each dish’s presentation — a dramatic puff of dry ice here, or a glittering dusting of 24k edible carat gold there — inviting an atmosphere of immersion for diners to understand which element grounds the course. A journey from air (lightness) to earth (depth) with the interludes of water and fire take guests on a ride of airy foams, crisp layers, and fluffy textures; smoke, char, and grilled intensity; clean crudos and fresh fish; and umami depth, slow-cooked meats, and soil-like textures. When asked what his favorite element to play with was, Tolentino was the most excited about air. “It’s intangible but it changes how you experience flavor and texture. Working with lightness — foams, aerations — allowed me to surprise guests without overwhelming them. It taught me how something almost invisible can leave such a strong impression,” he said. The Burnt Brazo dessert — air and fire meeting halfway — features local passion fruit, calamansi, vanilla egg custard, and Italian meringue, whipped delicately and then burnt with hot charcoal right at the table, a reminiscent nod to childhood s’mores. Roasted and sweet, fluffy and light, the fruit components bring liveliness to the meringue, something Tolentino aims to do when presenting familiar produce and ingredients — breathing air and new life into them. But water is where his favorite dish of this menu lies. “The Blue Crab Ice Cream Sandwich is very close to my heart. It takes something familiar from our waters and presents it in a way that’s unexpected, playful, but still comforting. I love that it challenges perceptions without losing that connection to home,” he said. It’s a crunchy and delicate snack eaten with your hands, an ode to childhood ice cream sandwiches (but one that we definitely couldn’t afford back then). Blue crab filling is inside an indulgent chicken skin biscuit, with mango gel, osetra caviar, and cold smoked roe, to give it an elevated one-bite umami bite that isn’t too overwhelming but is actually cold and refreshing. The amuse-bouche Prawn Butter Brioche is another highlight — rich, fresh local river prawn custard butter atop a fluffy and slightly sweet lemongrass brioche. Water and fire do not usually go together, but Tolentino’s Hokkaido Scallop and Corn do, proving even opposing elements can be respectfully united. The scallops are lightly smoked and cured, bouncy and tender, atop a creamy bisque of Japanese corn with shrimp head fat drizzled on top. Mixed, the shrimp fat adds richness to the sweet corn. The palate cleanser 24k Magic is pretty and sparkly, and a welcome break from the richness of the first half of the menu — fermented guava soft gel and lime pandan syrup offer a fruity, tart pause before the heavier, fire-breathing courses that follow. “Lately, I’ve been working a lot with fermentation. It’s alive, ever-changing, and brings a depth that you can’t create any other way. There’s a certain humility in letting time and process shape flavor — it’s not just the chef’s hand, but about patience and respect,” Tolentino shared. Each dish has a story to tell, and an element takes center stage — from fire breathing smoky life into the tender A5 wagyu balbacua, grilled and dry-aged, with beef tendon demi-sauce and kadyos purée for a hint of acidity to counterbalance the beef’s richness; to water and flow in the wet-aged hamachi, plump, fresh, and clean, laid on a snow of fresh longan and calamansi. Add a scoop of creamy avocado purée, and you have Tolentino’s vision of a refreshing crudo, where both fruit and fish shine. The Dry Aged Duck, grilled until gamey and tender, features a keso de bola veil, braised duck meat quenelle, smoked truffle sauce, and coconut ash duck sauce — a brown-on-brown dish that doesn’t hold back on richness and saltiness. “I want them to leave curious and inspired. Whether it’s their first fine dining meal or one of many, I hope they see how food can be both thoughtful and approachable,” Tolentino said about his wish for Taupe’s diners. “We’re not just about spectacle. It’s about transformation, balance, and discovery. If they walk away with a memory that makes them think differently about what food can be, then we’ve done our job.” The meal ends with petit fours influenced by his childhood and travels — Turon with smoked banana mousse, banana cylinder, and caviar; Bibingka with salted egg semifreddo and coconut custard; Hopia with red and green mung bean ganache and pinipig tuile; and Karyoka with fried glutinous rice, purple yam, and rosehip compote. Taupe’s 10-course tasting menu, priced at P7,800, and its eight-course tasting menu at P6,500, sit at the higher end of the tasting menu price range. But considering the number of courses, the handpicked selection of high-quality ingredients, and the overall dining experience, they are justified. The atmosphere is neither stiff nor stuffy, but modern and simple — an ambiance that directly reflects Tolentino’s culinary philosophy. With Michelin recognition now attached to both Tolentino and Taupe, there are no plans to change course. After all, why fix what isn’t broken? Tolentino’s promise for every seasonal tasting menu is to continue focusing on the best local ingredients of the moment while constantly reimagining how to highlight what makes each component special — both individually and together in unison. – Rappler.com",True,true,Nature meets technique: Chef Francis Tolentino is in his element at Taupe,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/chef-francis-tolentino-taupe-nature-meets-technique-elements/,Rappler
"About one in four employees has a diagnosable mental health condition, and up to 65 percent say mental health concerns interfere with their ability to work. The economic toll is staggering. In the United States alone, mental health concerns cost over $280 billion annually. Worldwide, that figure reaches an estimated US$1 trillion annually. Mental health is increasingly being recognized as critical to workplace functioning. Organizations invest substantial resources in wellness programs, mental health training and employee assistance programs. Some even offer on-site therapy sessions at no cost to their employees. Yet despite these efforts, many employees remain hesitant to seek help or disclose their mental health conditions. This reluctance can leave employees under-supported and contribute to increased absenteeism and turnover. Those who choose not to disclose often miss out on access to workplace accommodations and support, which can exacerbate their conditions and even increase the risk of job loss. Disclosure can be a gateway to vital support, but questions remain about how to facilitate such disclosures. Our research, recently published as an open-access article, shows the decision to disclose a mental health condition isn’t purely personal and can depend on the broader workplace environment. Across two samples, we surveyed 1,232 employees from Canada and the US. We recruited participants from Qualtrics, an online panel provider, and a large financial institution in Canada that operates across multiple locations. We asked employees — both with and without mental health concerns — to indicate the extent to which they perceived their organization as supportive of disclosing mental health concerns. Employees with mental health concerns shared whether they had disclosed their condition to their employer, how willing they were to disclose in the future, their levels of anxiety and depression, and a range of work-related attitudes and behaviors. We found that a work environment that was safe and supported the disclosure of mental health concerns was extremely beneficial for both employees and organizations. First, employees working in highly supportive environments were 55 percent more likely to disclose their mental health concerns. These environments were also linked to greater willingness to disclose current or potential mental health concerns. Second, supportive environments were associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression, both of which are important indicators of mental health. This suggests that organizations can contribute to employee mental health by fostering supportive environments. Third, employees who felt their organization supported disclosure reported higher job satisfaction, greater work engagement, and more organizational citizenship behaviors, such as helping co-workers or going above and beyond their job duties. These kinds of behaviors help create healthy, high-performing workplaces. In one of our samples, we matched employee responses with their organizational records of absenteeism. We found that when employees rated their organizational environment as supportive of mental health disclosure, they were less likely to miss work due to illness. Our study identified three elements of a workplace that support mental health disclosure. The first is the absence of stigma and anticipated discrimination. Many employees choose to conceal their concerns because they are fearful of being stigmatized, facing unfair treatment or being passed over for promotions. Employees often pick up on subtle cues in their environment — consciously or not — to estimate the risk of stigma. If they observe colleagues with disclosed mental health conditions being treated negatively, this signals low organizational support and makes disclosure appear risky. The second element is the availability of organizational resources. Disclosing one’s mental health concerns should unlock access to organizational supports, such as time off or counseling programs. These supports need to be tangible and go beyond mere mentions in the employee handbook. Employees form perceptions about how seriously their organization takes mental health based on whether these resources are present and accessible. The third element is the presence of social support. Our research found that social support was an important indicator of informal culture around mental health concerns. Such support may include emotional support from peers or supervisors, and the ability to openly discuss mental health. Employees notice whether, and how, mental health is discussed at work. When employees are encouraged to talk openly about it, the workplace appears more conducive to disclosure. In contrast, when concerns are dismissed or met with unhelpful advice such as “stay positive” or “toughen up,” the environment is unlikely to be seen as supportive. Our research points to four main strategies organizations can use to foster an environment that signals support for disclosing mental health concerns. 1. Identify areas for improvement Our research provides a list of survey items that organizations can use to track employee perceptions and identify priority areas for improvement. For example, employees might be asked whether they feel safe disclosing a mental health concern, or whether they believe the organization responds supportively when others do. These items can be include in annual employee surveys, with anonymity ensured to encourage honest responses. 2. Combat stigma by role modeling Workplace leaders are well-positioned to make positive change and role model appropriate behaviors. Employees often look to leaders and model their behavior. Providing leaders with training about implicit biases, and equipping them with tools to provide support to employees with mental health concerns, can help start the cycle of positive change. Leaders who receive mental health training tend to be more supportive, more likely to encourage disclosure and are better able to guide employees toward appropriate help. 3. Make resources visible and easily accessible Even when organizations have resources available, employees may not know about them or may find them difficult to access. Organizations and managers need to frequently communicate about the availability of mental health resources and ensure they are easy to access. Red tape and bureaucracy can deter employees from accessing organizational supports. 4. Talk openly about mental health Talking about mental health can help normalize it and encourage employees to share their concerns. This can include intentionally creating opportunities for such discussions, such as mental health days. In addition, when senior leaders share their experiences with mental health concerns, it can help normalize such discussions. Ultimately, a disclosure-supportive environment benefits employee mental health and encourages positive work behaviors. In other words, when employees feel safe enough to speak up, both employees and organizations benefit from it. – Rappler.com Zhanna Lyubykh is an assistant professor at Beedie School of Business, Simon Fraser University.

"MANILA, Philippines — Hotels are among the busiest establishments during the holidays, and it’s no secret that it takes logistics and careful planning to give Filipino families the time of their lives in a home away from home. But with the country facing an environmental crisis amid frequent calamities, it’s becoming increasingly clear that intervention is needed before the Philippines’ natural resources reach an irreparable state. Hotels and resorts are known for generating a significant amount of food and linen waste, given the high volume of guests and the intensity of daily operations. In light of these challenges, how do these establishments contribute to the push for sustainable living? Here’s how some local establishments are holding themselves accountable through their environmental initiatives and upcycling programs. Launched in 2024, the Okada Green Heart initiative has been promoting environmentally responsible practices that aim to contribute to the fight against climate change. The sustainability program covers six bases of their environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) principles. Waste management, energy efficiency, and water conservation are just some of the issues that the Okada Green Heart addresses with its various programs and initiatives. On September 19, the Parañaque-based hotel led a Coastal Cleanup Drive alongside the Okada Boardwalk Seaside in line with their defense against marine pollution, with around 358 volunteers from the Okada Green Heart program collecting a whopping 4.49 metric tons of trash from the coastlines. They also collaborated with the Philippine Business for Social Progress (PBSP) for the Motolite Balik Baterya Program, which helped upcycle 33,000 kilograms (kg) of used batteries into 80 desks and chairs for the Tambo Elementary School Unit 1 in Parañaque City. Okada Manila is a hotel and resort located in the Entertainment City complex along Manila Bay. It opened its doors to patrons and guests on New Year’s Eve 2016. It is owned by Tiger Resort Leisure and Entertainment Incorporated. Established in 2008, Atmosphere Resorts and Spa was built on an old coconut plantation in the Negros Islands. Being situated opposite the tourist destination Apo Island, the resort supports marine conservation and environmental awareness. In collaboration with the host local government unit and Oriental Negros International School, the resort co-founded the Institute for Marine Research (IMR) in Dauin. The IMR is a grassroots nonprofit that focuses on research on marine ecosystems to create conservation strategies for the Philippines. It offers courses for aspiring marine biologists and nature advocates in diving and coral reef preservation. Guests can apply as a research assistant, research fellow, research assistant with divemaster internship, or research assistant with instructor development. All of the courses provided are certified by the Professional Association of Diving Instructors, an international dive training organization founded in California. Also under the IMR is the Dauin Municipality Long-Term Reef Monitoring Project, which helps monitor the coral reefs’ threats and population in the Dauin Inshore Reef and on Apo Island. The Makati-based hotel, which has been open since December 2012, was lauded with the Green Globe Certification Standard in 2023, an internationally acclaimed certification group known for recognizing sustainable tourism in hotels. Raffles Hotel Makati was the first-ever hotel in the Philippines to be awarded the certification. The hotel collaborated with Solarius Energy, a Nueva Vizcaya based solar dealer, to be one of the first in providing electric vehicle (EV) charging facilities in support of energy preservation and cleaner transportation. The hotel has also established Green Team, an environmental task force consisting of prominent figureheads across Raffles Hotel’s organization. Task force members are in charge of monitoring and implementing sustainable practices across the area. In 2023, Raffles Hotel Makati partnered with Virlanie Foundation in an effort to donate excess food from their in-house buffet, Spectrum, to the members of said foundation. As of July 2024, the hotel has donated a total of 2,760 kg of food. The hotel isn’t shy about waste management either, as they are also in talks with the Integrated Waste Management through a composting program. Since their first collaboration in 2024, Raffles Hotel has composted 36,540 kg worth of trash. Mövenpick Resort & Spa Boracay (MRSB) in July 2024 introduced “No Bin Fridays: Reducing Waste One Meal at a Time,” in alignment with their goal of mindful consumption and sustainability. Every Friday, the in-house kitchen team prepares meals that are made with minimal to zero food waste. They go so far as closing trash bins to minimize leftovers and promoting a culture of awareness in food consumption. In September 2024, the hotel collaborated with No Space 4 Waste (NS4W), a Boracay-based nonprofit dedicated to controlling the waste that gets sent to its landfill. The hotel collated 428 glass bottles, and 147 kg from these bottles were crushed to create alternative beach sand and eco-friendly hollow blocks for construction. More than 10,000 yards have been upcycled by SM Hotels and Convention Centers’ (SMHCC) sustainability initiative called Tela Tales, promoting proper waste reduction and community engagement. After its launch on World Recycling Day in 2024, the program has given women volunteers a livelihood “one textile at a time” as taken from their slogan. SMHCC collaborated with social designer and entrepreneur Zarah Juan in making the designs from used hotel materials like bedsheets, banquet linens, and towels. Through the program’s drive in recycling and transforming materials to something new, Tela Tales was able to answer the call for environmental reform and shaping women’s skills with the nearby SM Hotels in the area. Volunteers are spread out from places like Tagaytay, Nasugbu, and Quezon City. The volunteers are directly affected by their participation in the program, as a part of the proceeds goes to them, further supporting the livelihoods of women in local communities. Snuggle Mates, the newest product line of Tela Tales, is heavily inspired by the company’s other properties nationwide. With the help of the volunteers, the program was able to produce items like Bamboo the Panda for Lanson Place Mall of Asia, Ozzy the Bear for Taal Vista Hotel, among other toys. In January, Tela Tales ventured of Metro Manila for the first time, launching in Bacolod and Iloilo. In Iloilo, Tela Tales collaborated with the Homeless People’s Federation of the Philippines–Iloilo (HPFPI) wherein local craftsmen produce unique products that the community may find useful. HPFPI is an organization that pushes for urban inclusivity and decent housing, with the goal of securing tenure and improved economic conditions. In Bacolod, the program collaborated with nonprofit Negrense Volunteers for Change (NVC) to create the products. The NVC is dedicated to combatting hunger and poverty. Tela Tales Bacolod will produce Christmas ornaments made from empty Nespresso Pods as collected by Nespresso Philippines. All of the finished products will be showcased for sale at Park Inn by Radisson Iloilo and Bacolod, giving artisans another livelihood platform. The proceeds will go directly to their partner organizations’ charity programs, like the NVC’s Mingo Meals Nutrition Program. The Mingo Meals Nutrition Program is an initiative that brings nutritious meals to impoverished families. Mainly marketed to feed infants and toddlers, the instant porridge consists of locally sourced rice, mung beans, and malunggay. In a country like the Philippines where environmental challenges is constant, sustainability isn’t a trend — it has become a necessity. The initiatives that these hotels have started are just one step closer to help consumers realize that the environment needs more than just simple likes and shares on social media. Everybody must be responsible in making the world greener. – Juliana Chloe Gonzales/Rappler.com Juliana Chloe Gonzales is a Rappler intern studying AB Communication Arts at the De La Salle University.",True,true,"From trash to treasure: Local hotels embrace upcycling, conservation",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/local-hotels-upcycling-programs/,Rappler
"A few days ago, the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) came out with smoking gun evidence that unprogrammed appropriations or funds have been used for infrastructure projects in at least the past two years. Prior to this, our closest confirmation came from an admission of House appropriations committee chair Mika Suansing. In a plenary session, Suansing said that “The UA releases for flood control projects for 2023 is P34 billion, and for 2024, it is P107 billion. So across 2023 and 2024, the UA releases for the flood control project is P141 billion.” But now, PCIJ has the goods. Specifically, PCIJ was able to get its hands on Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs). These documents are issued by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) authorizing the release of money for items lodged in unprogrammed funds. PCIJ found that P213.8 billion of unprogrammed funds were released for public works, and over half of them (52%) were for flood control, followed by roads and bridges (38%), and multipurpose buildings or facilities (8.5%). What’s more, in the SAROs they got, the stated purpose of these projects were “To cover the implementation of various priority projects which are crucial in ensuring the achievement of the President’s Eight-Point Socioeconomic Agenda.” In short, Marcos had a direct hand in approving anomalous flood control projects from start to finish: from the crafting of the proposed budget (National Expenditure Program) all the way to the release of SAROs. This only emphasizes the fact that he can’t wash his hands and feign ignorance or surprise about all these projects. And remember that these documents that PCIJ got refer to releases in 2023 and 2024. Dubious infra projects have been going on for quite some time now, and it’s impossible for Marcos to know nothing about these anomalies. Either he’s terribly corrupt for allowing all these pork projects (no surprises there) or he’s terribly stupid for not knowing anything about them (an unlikely scenario). Very clearly, unprogrammed funds have emerged as the new receptacle for pork allocations. Despite this, authorities continue to claim that they’re innocuous. On October 29, in a recent forum in Clark, Undersecretary Goddes Libiran of the DBM spewed disinformation during the question and answer portion. To her mild surprise, someone in the audience asked, “Is it true that unprogrammed funds are pork barrel? What are UAs (unprogrammed appropriations)? How is it released?” She replied that for unprogrammed funds to be qualified as pork, it should be a huge lump-sum fund that could be spent on yet unidentified projects. But UA is not like that, Libiran said. This is false. UA is precisely a lump-sum fund. If you check in the General Appropriations Act, for a number of years there’s a line item called “Support for Infrastructure Projects and Social Programs” (later called SAGIP or “Strengthening Assistance for Government Infrastructure and Social Programs”) that do not specify at all what projects will be spent on. For the 2026 budget, this is exactly what Congress modified, to stop the abuse of unprogrammed funds in the past. Specifically, under the leadership of Rep. Suansing, they removed “I” or infrastructure, so SAGIP is now just “Strengthening Assistance for Government Social Programs” or SAGP. This is an acknowledgement that unprogrammed funds had been abused in the past as a lump-sum fund for corruptible public works. The PCIJ documents prove this. Undersecretary Libiran added that the release of UA is very strict (but also said in the same breath, it’s “very lenient”). UA is supposedly not a discretionary fund of DBM, because agencies like the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) are the ones who request and justify the release. So as long as the documents are complete, including a certification from the Treasury that there are excess funds, Libiran said they must release the funds (otherwise the Commission on Audit will go after them). But this points to a missing piece of the puzzle: where are the certifications coming from the Treasury that excess funds do exist? The DBM needs these documents to release money for unprogrammed appropriations. But it’s highly doubtful that there exist excess revenues to justify the release of hundreds of billions of pesos for unprogrammed funds. Also, just because the DPWH requests the release of unprogrammed funds doesn’t mean that DBM has no discretion at all in the release of funds. In fact, they have too much discretion. The budget law itself states that “prioritization of funding of the purposes under the UA” should follow a priority list, and infrastructure projects are low on that list (following personnel benefits, social services, government counterpart of foreign-assisted projects). But in the next provision there’s a loophole: “the order of priority may be modified to support the funding of urgent or implementation-ready projects,” including “the 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda.” This, I realize, is the loophole that DBM can use to justify release of UA for public works (as confirmed by the documents PCIJ gathered). Near the end of the provisions for unprogrammed funds, it also states that, “The DBM is hereby authorized to approve the… modification of amounts within the authorized purposes” and “use of amounts under Purposes of the UA, except the Budgetary Support to GOCCs (Government-Owned and -Controlled Corporations) and the Support to Foreign-Assisted Projects.” In other words, the DBM has wide latitude on how unprogrammed funds will be prioritized and released. What this all suggests is that there’s more to the DBM-DPWH relationship than meets the eye. I hope this gets revealed in the hearings of the Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI), but frankly I’m not hoping that their investigations will amount to much. On Facebook, I called out the “fake news” that Undersecretary Libiran was saying in the Clark event. She replied lengthily, including: “Supreme Court na nga nagsabi na constitutional and legal ang UA, and it is different from pork barrel, pinipilit mo pa rin?” (No less than the Supreme Court has said that UA is constitutional and legal, and it is different from pork barrel, and you’re still insisting otherwise?) The thing is, the Supreme Court has yet to try and decide on a case alleging that unprogrammed funds are unconstitutional. The rebuttal itself includes fake news! At any rate, unprogrammed funds have indeed evolved as the newest iteration of pork: bloated lump-sum funds that allow for post-enactment discretionary spending by the DBM and other agencies, at the behest of politicians. If that’s not pork, I don’t know what is. Sadly, the House version of the 2026 budget promises to include at least P243 billion in unprogrammed funds. The Senate vows to remove this, but let’s see how far they can go about it. I expect budget deliberations to be railroaded up until December, with pork allocations safe and sound.

"PNB Holdings Corporation (PNB Holdings) is listing its shares on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) in what is known as “listing by way of introduction” (LBWI). The plan has long been laid out but the process only gained traction recently when the company took the formal steps on December 26, 2025, leading to the filing of the listing application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the PSE — with the listing to have been occurred this week. Recall that the board of directors of the Philippine National Bank (PNB) approved on April 23, 2021 the property dividend declaration of up to 239,353,710 common shares of PNB Holdings to all stockholders of record as of May 18, 2021. Property dividends occur when a company declares and distributes assets other than cash, such as shares of stocks in a company’s subsidiary or affiliate or tangible products of the company. Through the distribution of PNB Holdings shares via the declaration of the property dividends, all shareholders of PNB will become part owners of the company, allowing them to benefit from future potential gains from the development of the properties held by the former. The potential gains may materialize in the form of an increase in the valuation of the shares received or entitlement to dividends out of the earnings realized from the company’s property assets. The property dividend was paid at a ratio of 0.156886919 shares of PNB Holdings for every 1 share of PNB. The ratio for property dividend was determined by dividing the total number of outstanding shares declared as property dividends of PNB Holdings, which is 239,353,710 common shares, by the total number of outstanding shares of PNB of 1,525,764,850. The distribution of the property dividends to PNB’s shareholders has been going since October 25, 2024. In case a stockholder was entitled to a fractional PNB Holdings share, PNB will pay for such fraction in cash based on par value on the payment or settlement date. Only stockholders who have settled the required Final Withholding Tax (FWT) and has received the electronic Certificates Authorizing Registration (eCARs) from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) could claim the property dividend. LBWI is not a new method for public listing. It has been one of the listing standards long availed of in the local bourse by securities issuers. Due to some questions encountered in the past about its sound application, it was suspended for further review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 18, 2010, through Memorandum No. 2010-0072. On March 24, 2010, LBWI was restored. This now forms part of the revised rule of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) on listing by way of introduction. Primarily, a company chooses to list by LBWI in order to gain access to the capital markets in the future — the capital markets offer a ready form of funding for companies, enabling them to embark on growth and expansion plans or to fund their working capital with greater ease. Another is to unlock the intrinsic value and market share-price potential of the company. Listing will allow a company’s shares to trade on the stock exchange, with its intrinsic value or price determined by market demand and supply forces. In other words, the exercise will enable the generation of a market determined valuation for the company. Corollary to share-price discovery, the exercise will enable the company to give a separate market presence to assets already distributed. Finally, LBWI is shown to be a practical and efficient way of listing one’s shares of stock in the stock market. It dispenses with the cumbersome and time-consuming process of a public offering. Likewise, LBWI can also ensure fair market valuation in the same way how the investing public is usually assured good valuation thorough due-diligence review process in a public offering. Its success is further assured by a number of sound post-listing requirements that safeguard the integrity of the issue as provided for in the revised SEC rule for LBWI. Given that PNB Holdings shares are already fully paid for, the aim of the present undertaking is not to raise capital immediately, but to provide the company with a regulated environment within which to trade its shares and be able to pursue its goal for liquidity and strategic growth. PNB Holdings is currently focused on the enhancement and redevelopment of the PNB Financial Center in Pasay City, the PNB Makati Center along Ayala Avenue, and the Buendia–Paseo de Roxas commercial lot in Makati City. At the moment, upgrades continue at the PNB Makati Center and PNB Financial Center to maintain their competitiveness as prime leasing properties until such time that they are ready for redevelopment. These enhancements are intended to ensure that the buildings remain aligned with current property market requirements. The LBWI may also pave the way for an “eventual follow-on offering (FOO) within the next three to four years” as part of PNB Holdings capital-raising initiatives to support future redevelopment plans. However, no definitive decision has yet been made regarding any FOO nor is there a definitive timetable or structure on the matter at this time. What is clear is at present is that the LBWI is a strategy to provide an orderly trading venue and liquidity for the PNB Holdings shares distributed as property dividends to PNB stockholders, and to support long-term strategic direction. The three properties are carried at a book value amounting to P46.8 billion. This initially implies significant unrealized gains of around P34.1 billion based on the market value of P80.9 billion as of late 2025. These market values are as well expected not just to hold but may even increase due to ongoing redevelopment projects in surrounding districts. The PNB Financial Center in Pasay City, near Manila Bay, is a 10-hectare property. It’s the company’s largest asset in terms of total leasable area and currently outperforms other players in the Bay Area market. Meanwhile, the PNB Makati Center on Ayala Avenue, within the Makati Central Business District (CBD) has ongoing upgrades, which is expected to reach near full occupancy by 2026. The 8,000-sqm commercial lot at the intersection of Senator Gil J. Puyat Avenue and Paseo de Roxas in Makati City while empty is considered the company’s “readiest asset for redevelopment” and its full value is expected to be maximized using the new floor area ratio (FAR) product mix. The company’s main strategy to maximize the value of its current assets and exploring future growth is to focus on opportunities within the commercial, office, retail, and ultra-luxury segments, leveraging on their strategic locations. It will be implemented through a multi-phased plan that may provide a sustained growth pipeline for PNB Holdings for the next 15 years, accordingly. On the other hand, while there is no approved plan at this time for the company to enter the “mass residential market,” PNB Holdings is not discounting the matter altogether as it continues to monitor market developments as part of its strategic review processes. Keep an eye on the company’s disclosures upon listing, it might just become more than a SPECULATIVE BUY. – Rappler.com (The article has been prepared for general circulation for the reading public and must not be construed as an offer, or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or financial instruments whether referred to herein or otherwise.

"Foreign visitors to the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, and other US national parks will pay higher entrance fees than Americans starting in January, President Donald Trump’s administration said on Tuesday, November 25. The fee hike follows an executive order Trump signed in July that said additional revenue generated from foreign tourists would be used for conservation and deferred maintenance projects to improve national parks, even as his administration seeks to cut national park spending by more than a third. The order had also directed the Park Service to ensure that US residents receive priority access over foreign visitors in any of its permitting or reservation systems. The Interior Department said on Tuesday, November 25, that visitors from other countries will be charged $250 for an annual pass to the parks starting January 1, while US citizens and permanent residents will continue to pay $80. Foreign tourists without an annual pass will pay a new $100-per-person fee at 11 of the most visited national parks, the department said in a statement. The list of most visited parks includes the Everglades in Florida, Yosemite in California, and the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. Visitors have flocked to national parks in record numbers in recent years, with admissions soaring to a new high of 331 million in 2024, up 6 million from 2023. Reduced personnel levels at some national parks, including Yosemite and Big Bend in Texas, have forced closures, reduced programming and impeded emergency response operations, according to the National Parks Conservation Association, a watchdog-advocacy group. The Trump administration has proposed cutting more than $1 billion from the Park Service budget in fiscal 2026, which would represent a reduction of more than a third of the agency’s budget from the prior year. – Rappler.com",True,true,Visiting the Grand Canyon?

"As Filipinos continue to grapple with the rising cost of living, calls for a tax holiday have resurfaced as a supposed quick fix to ease economic burdens. While well-intentioned, a tax holiday is neither equitable nor sustainable. It offers temporary relief at the expense of long-term fiscal stability, benefiting only a limited segment of society while eroding much-needed government revenues. According to the 2024 Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Annual Report, the total withholding tax on compensation amounts to ₱364.45 billion. This represents 23.78% of the total income tax collection, which is ₱1.53 trillion, and 47.66% of the total individual income tax collection, which stands at ₱764.63 billion. These figures highlight the significant contribution of salary-based income taxes to the country’s overall tax revenue, highlighting the importance of compensation-based taxes in the Philippines’ fiscal system. If the proposed one-month income tax holiday for employees is implemented, it is estimated to result in a revenue loss of more than ₱33 billion. This highlights the fiscal impact of the measure, which would reduce government funds for crucial public services and infrastructure, even though it offers short-term relief for workers. In 2024, there were 23.64 million registered compensation earners in the Philippines falling into different income groups. Around 13.90 million workers (59%) are considered low-income earners, earning ₱250,000 or less annually, and are thus already exempt from income tax under the current law. Meanwhile, 9.69 million workers (41%) belong to the middle-income groups, including the lower-middle, middle-middle, upper-middle, and upper-income brackets, and are subject to withholding tax (i.e., 15 to 30%) on their salaries. Only a small fraction, approximately 71,000 workers (0.3%), are classified as high-income earners, earning more than ₱8 million annually. This distribution illustrates that most employees are either exempt from taxes or fall within the middle-income range, with a small portion of high-income individuals contributing significantly to the tax base. Based on the data above, approximately 9.69 million employees (41% of registered compensation earners) stand to benefit from the proposed one-month income tax holiday. These individuals fall under the middle-income groups, earning above ₱250,000 annually, and are currently subject to withholding tax on their salaries. The majority of employees — around 13.90 million (59%) — are exempt from income tax due to being Minimum Wage Earners (MWE) or having low income (i.e. ₱250,000 or less annually), meaning they would not directly benefit from the proposed tax holiday. Therefore, the tax holiday would primarily benefit those in the middle- to upper-income brackets, while offering no immediate relief to MWEs and low-income workers. Given these disparities, alternative tax reforms may be a more equitable solution. One option is raising the income tax exemption threshold, as proposed in Senator Win Gatchalian’s GINHAWA Act. The bill suggests increasing the exemption to ₱400,000, meaning income below this amount would be tax-exempt. It also proposes raising the tax-free bonus cap from ₱90,000 to ₱150,000, allowing employees to keep more of their year-end bonuses. Although raising the exemption threshold could benefit a wider group of people, it presents significant challenges to fiscal sustainability. Like the proposed one-month tax holiday, such changes must be carefully considered in light of the government’s ability to fund essential public services, social programs, and development goals. Tax relief is an important issue, but any reform must strike a balance between supporting Filipino workers and ensuring the government can maintain sufficient revenue for its operations. This involves not only introducing new tax laws or adjusting current rates (e.g., excise taxes, rate unification, price floors) but also improving collection efficiency, curbing illicit trade (such as counterfeit goods, smuggled products, and illegal mining), and ensuring proper tax compliance. Ultimately, any tax policy reform should prioritize equity, sustainability, and long-term economic stability. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Ask the Tax Whiz] What’s the impact of the income tax holiday proposal to PH economy?,https://www.rappler.com/business/ask-the-whiz-impact-income-tax-holiday-proposal-philippine-economy/,Rappler
"A blend of the Cordillera and the French countryside unfolded within this château-inspired space in Baguio. It’s a spot called Le Coq Bleu Homestay, owned by Chantal Michaut-Pangilinan, a Frenchwoman who has lived in the city for over 30 years and is married to a Kapampangan. The Victorian-esque furniture, quirky art pieces, including sketches by Baguio artist Leonardo Aguinaldo, and colors and styling that were undeniably French created a charming, immersive environment. It primarily functions as an Airbnb for just a couple of guests. “Nothing here is new,” Chantal said. “Either heirloom pieces like the knives and utensils from my parents, this couch from my husband’s parents’ home, salvaged wood from a fallen tree, or trinkets from ukay-ukay (thrift shops), dining chairs from my time in Paris. I wanted to offer my guests Filipino hospitality with a French flair.” The dining table, seating six, was set with croissants, sweet apple compote, slices of pears, ube-flavored yogurt, Benguet coffee, French toast, fresh fruit salad, and an omelet infused with Cordilleran kiniing (traditional smoked and cured pork). Chantal can easily chat up guests, touching on food and football (with trivia about France’s Les Bleus goalie, Alphonse Areola, who is of Filipino descent), and her love for the Cordillera and the arts, even showing a portrait of herself painted by the late actor Johnny Delgado. “I didn’t pose for him; he painted based on his imagination of me,” she said. Chantal’s story is one of displacement, adaptation, and cultural synthesis. Raised during the American War in Vietnam, she and her family left the country at age 12, escaping Saigon before its fall. “My mother hosted parties for American generals and Ambassador (Henry) Cabot-Lodge; however, we, as a family, felt and witnessed the suffering of the locals on a daily basis,” she recalled. Adjusting to life in France proved challenging, and a few years later, the family moved to Hong Kong. A third-culture child, she described the experience of being “at home in any culture and yet never truly belonging anywhere, a wandering soul searching for its niche.” Her journey eventually brought her to the Philippines, first in Manila for 17 years, then in Baguio, where she found a home amid the Cordillera’s rich culture. In 2012, Chantal purchased a 130-square-meter lot from a friend to build her dream house. Inspired by her paternal grandparents’ cottage in the French Basque country and her husband’s memories of Baguio’s John Hay bungalows, she designed a simple 6×10-meter rectangle with a loft, emphasizing sustainability and recycled materials. “I became the architect, decorator, and contractor of this vision,” she shared. Friends rallied to help, supplying doors, windows, furniture, and décor. Every item tells a story of friendship, love, and care, and Chantal calls them “blessings from angels.” A year later, she added a guest suite, and five years after that, she purchased a neighboring property to build a tiny house with a Provence theme, recalling summers spent with her maternal grandparents. Nestled among trees, it offers privacy and tranquility, with birdsong, frogs, and rustling leaves as the soundtrack. The garden is intentionally wild, inviting local wildlife and creating a natural, serene environment for guests. Homestays, Chantal believes, are the truest form of hospitality, allowing travelers to experience authentic homes, cuisine, and culture. Guests can enjoy continental breakfasts by the bay window overlooking the mountains, lounge in the sunroom, read, write, or sit by the fireplace with a glass of wine. Some come for quiet reflection; others linger for a month, leaving feeling restored and recharged. “Come as guests, leave as friends,” Chantal said. Many return annually, forging bonds that extend beyond the stay, proving that hospitality at its best is not just a service, but an exchange of warmth, culture, and trust. Since Le Coq Bleu offers a single room in a loft-within-a-house and a garden cottage (it has an antique narra bed), most of its guests are couples. “Le Coq has been a favorite among LGBT couples,” Chantal shared. “They often say they don’t feel judged here and truly feel at home.” More than a homestay, Chantal thinks Le Coq Bleu sums up her life experiences in Vietnam, France, Hong Kong, Thailand, Manila, and finally, Baguio. The exterior echoes John Hay’s green-and-white bungalows; the interior reflects her French heritage in blue and white; and the rooster, the coq, symbolizes the shared culture between France and the Philippines. It’s a space where Chantal hopes travelers can explore identity, culture, and heritage, while enjoying quiet reflection, natural beauty, and warm hospitality. “I want to be the kind of host with whom guests can exchange stories, laugh and be carefree,” Chantal said. She is a host who was once a wandering soul, but finally found her place. – Rappler.com",True,true,A wandering soul finds her place in a Cordillera château,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/profile-chantal-pangilinan-le-coq-bleu-homestay/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The media and academic communities mourned the death of veteran business journalist Cai Ordinario, who passed away on Monday, November 17, at the age of 45. Ordinario, who reported on macroeconomic and urban development issues for BusinessMirror, died after her bout with cancer, according to BusinessMirror. “BusinessMirror mourns the passing of our senior reporter, Cai Ordinario — an award-winning journalist and dedicated educator whose work illuminated truths and inspired countless students and colleagues. Her legacy of sharp reporting, mentorship, and unwavering commitment to public service will continue to guide and uplift the communities she touched,” BusinessMirror said in a statement on Wednesday, November 19. Ordinario completed her journalism degree at the University of Santo Tomas (UST), where she was news editor of the Varsitarian, in 2022, and her Masters in Communication Research at the University of the Philippines in 2019. Ordinario first worked for the Manila Times before moving to BusinessMirror. She was a business reporter for Rappler in 2012, then returned to BusinessMirror less than a year later. The work of Ordinario, a former president of the Economic Journalist’s Association of the Philippines, had been recognized by award-giving bodies and government agencies, including the Philippine Statistics Authority. Ordinario won in PSA’s 2013 National Statistics Month (NSM) Media Awards for her Rappler story that used government statistics to explain the incidence of poverty in the country and to visualize where the poorest provinces are. She also won three consecutive PSA citations for Best Statistical Reporting in Print Media for her BusinessMirror reports from 2020 to 2022. “Her legacy of excellence and integrity will continue to inspire those in the fields of journalism and statistics,” the PSA said in a statement on Wednesday. “With Cai’s passing, the PSA has lost a steadfast ally in ensuring truth and balance in the reporting of national statistics and economic issues. It has been a privilege for us to collaborate with her.” The Department of Economy, Planning and Development, which selected Ordinario as DEPDev’s Outstanding Reporter for 2024, described her as a “brilliant and dedicated journalist whose work illuminated complex economic and development issues with clarity and insight.” “Her ability to translate technical matters into compelling stories empowered the public to better understand the forces shaping our nation,” DEPDev said. “DEPDev honors her invaluable contributions to economic journalism, marked by accuracy, integrity, and a profound sense of responsibility. Through her reporting on the economy, development challenges, and the lived realities of Filipinos, she not only informed but elevated public discourse, embodying the highest ideals of her profession,” it added. Ordinario is not only a veteran journalist but also a beloved educator. “The UP CMC honors Cai Ordinario as a colleague, mentor, and friend. Her passing is a profound loss to the academic and media communities, but her legacy endures in the countless students she inspired and the stories she courageously told,” the UP College of Media and Communication (UP-CMC) said in a statement on Wednesday, November 19. Odinario was a lecturer at the UP Department of Journalism on business journalism “and mentored students to approach economic reporting with both analytical precision and social conscience,” the UP-CMC said. “As a veteran economic reporter for BusinessMirror, she distinguished herself through incisive coverage of macroeconomic policy and trade, earning recognition for her clarity, rigor, and courage in exposing systemic issues that shaped national discourse,” UP-CMC said. “Her colleagues and students remember her not only for her professional excellence but also for her generosity of spirit. She guided young journalists with patience and insight, reminding them that journalism is a public trust and a service to the people. Her presence in the classroom and newsroom was marked by humility, warmth, and an unwavering commitment to truth,” it added. Ordinario also taught journalism in her alma mater, UST, which honored her “legacy of journalistic excellence,” citing her Hall of Fame award in the Bright Leaf Agriculture Journalism Awards. The UST Faculty of Arts and Letters said: “With her vast experience in the field, she generously poured her knowledge into every lesson, thus preparing her students to pursue their craft diligently and purposefully. You will be dearly missed, Ma’am Cai.” The UST Journalism Society mourned the death of Ordinario. “A journalist who embodied excellence and kindness, Ma’am Cai is someone who will truly be missed by many….

"MANILA, Philippines – Bounty Fresh is focusing its efforts into strengthening its operations in core businesses as demand for poultry in the Philippines is expected to grow in the mid-term. The agribusiness firm’s president and chief executive officer Kenneth Cheng said on Monday, October 13, that the company does not intend to go public any time soon, and instead, focus on strengthening its domestic supply chain. “Right now we’re investing for the future. We are not only investing in new farms, we’re also investing in new plants,” he explained. Cheng did not disclose the exact figure of Bounty Fresh’s capital expenditures (capex) for the year, but he noted that the firm is allocating around half of its capex to expansion. This includes the construction of new facilities such as farms and processing plants. Plans for expansion come as consultancy firm GIRA estimates that poultry consumption in the Philippines will grow 500,000 tons every five years. This translates to a poultry consumption of 4.5 million tons by 2050, double the current 2 million tons. “Filipinos are going to eat chicken, whether the local farmers produce them or not. If we don’t produce them, it will be coming in by importation. And so this is an opportunity for the local poultry farmer, but it’s also a challenge,” Cheng said. In order to keep up with growing poultry demand, Bounty Fresh aims to sustainably strengthen its supply chain by boosting production, distribution and market reach to balance growth with demand. Cheng noted that one of the obstacles to achieving this is the limited workforce in agriculture as the youth pursue other fields. He also stressed the need to invest in the agricultural sector’s workforce to develop stockmanship and create a career pipeline that younger generations can build a career out of. The Bounty Fresh chief also underscored the need to invest in biosecurity to help the sector keep pace with the demand. Bounty Fresh is the Philippines’ second largest poultry integrator. The company estimates that it contributes around a quarter of the country’s total poultry production. Cheng added that that the Inoza Group’s recent acquisition of the Bistro Group will help integrate Bounty Fresh’s chicken business into the restaurants. Inoza Holdings of Bounty Fresh chairman Tennyson Chen acquired 22% of the Bistro Group from tycoon Andres Soriano III’s A.

"MANILA, Philippines – You might’ve come across castles, cars, and cities built from LEGO bricks, but have you seen a carabao? Almost a year after introducing its Mamang Sorbetero display at Ayala Malls Manila Bay, The LEGO Group and Ban Kee Trading Incorporated level up with another exciting 3D ensemble — a farmer and a carabao — in their newest LEGO Certified Store in Cavite. The branch opened on October 19 at Building D, Ground Floor, Ayala Malls Vermosa in Imus. As you step right into the store, you’ll notice a striking centerpiece, not just with a carabao and a farmer, but a sack of rice, coconuts, and a vibrant basket of corn and bananas — featuring the heart of Cavite’s crops and proudly integrating the country’s agricultural roots within the LEGO experience. “Syempre nasa Pilipinas tayo — pride natin ‘yan. For Cavite naman, known siya for farming, kaya nagdecide kami na magkaroon tayo ng farmer with carabao,” Ian Maquinana, marketing staff for LEGO Certified Store PH, shared with Rappler. (Of course we’re in the Philippines, so that’s our pride. Cavite is known for farming, so we decided to have a farmer with a carabao.) An upcoming contest will center on the farmer-and-carabao display, where people can guess the number of bricks used to build the model. Participants simply need to register at the Vermosa branch for a chance to win exciting LEGO prizes, with full details to be announced soon. As Maquinana explained, the success of the Alabang Town Center branch paved the way for another LEGO spot in the south, where they can bring creativity closer to the location’s growing sense of community. Since it opened in 2023, Ayala Malls Vermosa has been redefining the mall experience with a 1.9-hectare central garden — an open, pet-friendly park ideal for families spending quality time with children. “Perfect siya kasi newly opened ‘yung mall, and then iba ‘yong surroundings. So ‘yung mga bata, may pasyalan, may park — open siya sa lahat,” he added. (It’s perfect because the mall is newly opened, and the surroundings are different. So for the kids, there’s a place to hang out, there’s a park — it’s open for everyone) In an area where play has plenty of space outdoors, this branch also brings the fun inside — whether it’s in collecting LEGO passport stamps, measuring your height in LEGO blocks, picking bricks to build, or designing your very own minifigures. As Maquinana highlighted, LEGO invites both children and adults not only to drop by their stores but also to stay and enjoy hands-on experiences. “LEGO is not just for kids. It’s for everyone. Dito sa LEGO Store namin, makikita mo na hindi lang siya for kids, meron din tayong area for adults,” he said. (Here in our LEGO store, you’ll see that it’s not just for kids, we also have an area for adults.) One of the most interactive activities is the LEGO Passport program, which turns your ordinary shopping into a travel adventure from one LEGO branch to another. The program was first introduced in the country during the opening of the Manila Bay branch, before expanding to stores like Vermosa. Here, you can collect stamps from any LEGO Certified Store in the Philippines and around the globe — each store with a unique and exclusive stamp design, making every visit exciting and memorable. Visitors only need to register at any LEGO Certified Store to get their passport for free. And if you already have six stamps from other LEGO Certified Stores, you can avail of a free LEGO Polybag for your seventh stamp at this Vermosa branch (no purchase required)! This is valid until December 31, 2025, until supplies last. Aside from its carabao centerpiece, this Vermosa store also unveils another refreshing feature compared to other stores in the metro — a colorful wall where children and adults can measure how tall they are in LEGO bricks. Another fun-fueled wall for all ages is the Pick & Build section, where people can select individual LEGO pieces of their choice from a wide range of parts and colors, priced at P679 per 100 grams.

"One in four women would likely have an abortion in their lifetime — either by choice or necessity. Despite this, poor countries like the Philippines have the strictest laws on abortion. In the case of the Philippines, abortion is not just prohibited, but also criminalized. Recently, Antoinette Jadaone’s film Sunshine dared to delve into this taboo topic, and has received awards from international film festivals. It tells the story of young gymnast Sunshine, who has big dreams but suddenly finds out she is pregnant. Shown in cinemas around the country, it opened discussions on abortion and how women in the Philippines are rarely given a choice regarding unplanned pregnancies.

"BENGUET, Philippines – Long before roads carved through the mountains in Kabayan, before tourism brochures called it mystical, the town in Benguet measured its seasons not by dates on a calendar but by the cry of a tiny red-throated bird. As the town marked its 125th founding anniversary and the 4th Kiling Festival on Thursday, November 27, the small migratory bird kiling (Siberian rubythroat) returned to center stage, carrying with it memory, myth and the heartbeat of Ibaloy identity. Kabayan – a town of more than 15,000 people, largely of Ibaloy descent – calls itself the cradle of Ibaloy culture, and the festival is a reminder of what that culture holds dear. Local folklore tells of a clever kiling, whose ruby-colored throat once fooled a rat into slashing its own neck in envy. It is a tale that Ibaloy children once learned like a lullaby, a story that tucked values of wit and survival into a single bright-feathered creature. But the kiling plays a role beyond myth. For generations of Ibaloy families, its high, crisp calls signaled the end of storms and the arrival of tegin, the cold season brought by the amihan (northeast monsoon) winds, which meant the start of rice planting. In the old days, the bird meant safety, renewal and the promise of food. “Kiling reminds us that rains have passed, and the new planting season begins,” Mayor Rex Alwin Aquisan said. “Its cry was once our guide.” This year’s celebration, held at the municipal grounds in Poblacion, gathered elders, youth, cultural performers and visitors to honor the Siberian rubythroat, the bird that travels from northern Russia to these Cordillera mountains every winter. Students in devit (girls) and g-string (boys) performed the Kiling-Tinikling, a fusion dance conceptualized by the late former mayor Faustino Aquisan, blending the bird’s movements with the familiar rhythm of tinikling, the folk dance in which a woman traditionally steps in and out of two long poles held close to the floor. Schools mounted performances, from Abucot Integrated School’s theatrical retelling of the kiling legend to modern ethno-cultural showcases by Ballay and Tawangan-Lusod students. Yet behind the celebration lies a quiet grief. The old rhythm of rice farming has faded. Kabayan once grew the heirloom kintoman (red rice), the grain used to make tapuy (rice wine), which took seven to eight months to harvest. Today, only a handful of farmers still plant it. Economics drove the change. Vegetable crops meant faster turnover and higher income. The slopes of Kabayan, even near Mount Pulag, slowly transformed into gardens of cabbage, cauliflower and potatoes, making the municipality a major vegetable producer in Benguet. Despite government encouragement to revive the heirloom rice, reality continues to weigh heavier than nostalgia. Families must survive. The festival’s theme, “Bridging Generations Through Culture and Progress,” captures the delicate balance Kabayan tries to achieve: honoring the past while navigating the demands of the present. For Aquisan, the message carries a deeper resonance especially after Super Typhoon Uwan (Fung-wong) impacted the town just weeks earlier, leaving damage and fear in its wake. Uwan, the 21st tropical cyclone to hit the country this year, struck Luzon with relentless rain and fierce winds. It hit Aurora as a super typhoon on November 9, then weakened to a typhoon the following day as it barreled over Northern Luzon’s rugged mountains. It tore through the country, forcing 1.4 million people to flee their homes and upending the lives of 3.6 million across 16 regions and 66 provinces. Officials reported 27 dead, roads and bridges damaged, and schools and workplaces shuttered as communities struggled to cope with the storm’s aftermath. “The Kiling Festival, inspired by the bird whose call once meant safety after storms, holds greater meaning for us now,” he told residents during his festival message. “We were tested again. But like the kiling, Kabayan rose.” “After every storm, there is renewal. After every hardship, a call toward progress. And after every challenge, Kabayan stands as one…. May our children inherit not only the memory of this festival but the love for our heritage,” he added. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Bird, dance, and Ibaloy life: A look at Kabayan, Benguet’s Kiling Festival",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/kiling-festival-ibaloy-kabayan-benguet-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Frizzy, limp, oily, or dry — Filipino hair can be a force to be reckoned with. Rebonding treatments, hair straighteners, serums, hair masks, and even hair curlers are part of many Filipinos’ haircare arsenal, and sometimes, they’re still not enough. What are the main problems and concerns the modern Filipina struggles with today when it comes to their hair? First, there’s the weather. Yvonne Piamonte, product integration lead of Dyson Beauty, shared with Rappler that aside from our tropical climate’s humidity — which makes style retention difficult — even simple brushing can cause frizz or static almost instantly. Filipinos have diverse hair types, from T1 to T4, in technical terms. T1 is straight, T2 is wavy, T3 is curly, and T4 is coily. This diversity makes it difficult to find an all-in-one solution for behaved hair. “That’s why it’s a must for haircare and product engineers to be ‘inclusive’ with the way we design, with the way we test, and we ensure that we take all of those hair types into account,” Piamonte said. Roy Fua, senior design engineer for Dyson Beauty, who specializes in human-machine interface, echoed the challenges of circumstances we cannot control. “Weather is one of the greatest challenges. We always get exposed to the sun. And then in the morning, it’s raining. In the afternoon, it’s sunny. So any curls that you create in the morning disappear in the afternoon. And we also have a special challenge of also taking care of your hair, right?” That’s why hair health should be paramount, Fua said. How do we help Filipinos achieve styles without damaging their hair with too much heat? The Philippine climate makes for “a really interesting challenge,” Fua shared. Piamonte and Fua both worked on the new Dyson Airwrap Coanda 2x, an upgraded version of the first model. The supercharged motor delivers twice the air pressure to wrap hair more easily, dries hair as fast as a full-performance hair dryer, and creates different looks. The 6-in-1 tool comes with attachments to dry, curl, wave, straighten, smooth, and volumize, with no heat damage. Piamonte described her job as “basically everything that goes inside the machine — your motor, your heater, your electronics.” Her role is to make sure everything works well with each other, which involves strict technical requirements, safety checks, and rigorous testing in line with global regulations. On the other hand, Fua’s work is about the human-machine interface and how users interact with the tool. “Whether it be the buttons, whether it’s the lights, how you’re going to use it is designed by us. So when you put in a barrel, when you put in an attachment, the machine thinks differently,” he explained. The focus on user experience is crucial for any appliance, especially given the uniqueness of Filipino hair. Piamonte noted that one common mistake is believing there’s only one correct way to achieve a hairstyle. “When in reality, it has to be like a tailor-fit type of preparation, type of hairstyling,” she said. “Maybe high heat and high flow isn’t exactly what’s for them,” she said. “It’s going to take a lot of exploration, but that’s why a tool must be manual or adjustable. So that it can cater to every hair type — and even in terms of expertise — it’s very beginner-friendly,” she added. Many seemingly innocent styling techniques today damage hair severely, Fua stressed. “They say niluluto yung buhok, right? Today it’s going to look good, but tomorrow it’s going to be frizzy. Because you already cooked your hair with the heat,” he said. Heat damage is the most familiar type, but it’s not the only one. Piamonte shared that one is mechanical damage, which happens when you repeatedly tug on your hair through brushing or using tools incorrectly. There’s also thermal damage, characterized by dryness, split ends, rough texture, and breakage caused by frequent heat styling. There’s chemical damage from perms, bleach, or dye. And lastly, UV damage from the sun, often unavoidable in the Philippines. “A lot of those things are really hard to avoid,” Piamonte said, especially by Metro Manila commuters, and especially with how hot it is here in the Philippines. “But again, for thermal damage — now that you have the option not to expose the hair in extreme temperatures — then that’s something that we can definitely recommend. Avoid thermal damage because that’s one of the main non-reversible reasons why our hair gets damaged,” she advised. Fua said he designed the tool’s attachments so users don’t have to make too many passes. “I see a lot of people — they brush so many times, they don’t know that there are so many hairs falling off,” Fua said. “My advice is just really focus more on your hair health and then just focus on getting the style that you need without doing too much brushing or heat.” In 2026, Piamonte foresees more Filipinos investing in hairstyling and haircare. According to hers and Fua’s observations, 2026 will see more layered hairstyles: voluminous, fresh, but tricky to shape because of the varying hair lengths. “Round brushes and curling barrels are going to come in handy next year. They are versatile enough to achieve those layers with a lot of bounce, a lot of volume,” she said. Celebrity stylist and Dyson Philippines ambassador Paul Nebres agreed that volume is in. “Modern Filipinas now are really more adventurous. They’re not afraid of doing different looks. And I think that the famous blowout is in; it really boosts your confidence,” Nebres said. For Fua, product design should never be short-term. “We try to design products to last not just next year. Like five years along the line, you can still use it to try any new trends,” he said. Trends, however, shift fast, so he is still unsure about what to expect. “It’s a little dynamic. We don’t know what’s going to be the trend in like two years, three years,” he said. But one interesting observation he shared was that more men are growing out their hair. “They’re trying to have like that long Korean perm!” he shared. According to Piamonte and Fua, designers should spend time studying individual hair strands of all textures and types inside and out, so that machines are designed with hair health at the forefront. – Rappler.com",True,true,How do product engineers design tools for Filipino hair?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/style/product-engineers-design-tools-filipino-hair-struggles/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Villar Land reported a P1.423-billion profit in 2024, relatively flat from its P1.416-billion net income in 2023. The controversial real estate firm of tycoon Manny Villar finally submitted its audited 2024 annual report to regulators on Thursday, November 13, after missing the deadline in May, leading the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) to suspend trading of its shares. According to its 2024 annual report, Villar Land’s bottomline stayed relatively flat due to weaker sales. “Real estate sales decreased by 26% from [P4.45 billion] for the year ended December 31, 2023 to [P3.3 billion] for the year ended December 31, 2024, due to the decrease in sales,” the company said. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently investigating Villar Land for supposedly misleading investors by publicizing its unaudited financial statements back in March through a board resolution. In the previous version of the earnings report, Villar Land made around P999 billion due to fair value gains from acquiring 400 hectares within its Villar City development in Cavite and Metro Manila from three other Villar-owned firms. The newly acquired properties were valued at P1.34 trillion. (READ: How did Manny Villar reclaim the title of richest Filipino?) Villar Land’s external auditors Punongbayan & Araullo did not accept the trillion-peso valuation, and requested for another appraisal of the properties. To expedite the release of its 2024 audited earnings report, Villar Land said it will instead value the land at cost-basis or the cost it paid to acquire the properties. “We want to highlight that while the company believes that it is the fair value of the Villar City properties that should be reflected in its financial statements, in the interest of securing the immediate release of the 2024 Audited Financial Statements, it reluctantly proposed to the external auditors the use of cost basis in recording its said properties,” Villar Land said in an earlier statement. The SEC has fined Villar Land’s directors, which include senators Camille Villar and Mark Villar, P12 million for the months-long delay in its report submission. It also ordered the appraiser of the Villar Land properties, E-Value Philippines Incorporated, to explain its P1.34-trillion appraisal of the land. In the first six months of 2025, Villar Land’s profit dropped 28% to just P557.5 million. Villar Land wrote in a disclosure to the PSE on Wednesday, November 12, that its topline continued to drop in double-digits, with its six-month revenues plunging 28% to just P1.7 billion. The Villar-owned developer attributed this to the continuous drop in real estate sales to just P1.7 billion from P2.3 billion in the same period in 2024. “This is due to the decrease in sales for the period as the Company is shifting its strategy to focus on expanding its real estate development footprint as the master developer of Villar City, supported by the recent acquisition of approximately 366 hectares within the Villar City masterplan,” it wrote. Its interest income on contract receivables also dipped 21% to just P55.4 million amid lower in-house financed sales. Growth in its interment income, however, cushioned the topline as it climbed 6% to P46.9 million. – Rappler.com",True,true,"From P999-B profit, Villar Land’s 2024 net income flat amid dipping sales",https://www.rappler.com/business/villar-land-earnings-report-2024-h1-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — Disney On Ice returns with its annual holiday tradition at the SM Mall of Asia Arena, featuring the theme Magic in the Stars, from December 20 to January 4, 2026! This year, the Disney-themed family live show is debuting new faces and bringing back some familiar ones.

"MANILA, Philippines – The towering figure that was the late Teddy Co may have passed on three years ago, but his spirit lives on. Co was a prominent film curator, archivist, regional cinema champion, and board member of the QCinema Film Foundation. “Teddy Co was the one who first urged QCinema International Film Festival (QCIFF) to apply for the UNESCO honor when Baguio and Cebu got awarded [the previous years],” QCIFF artistic director Ed Lejano recalled. In late October, UNESCO declared Quezon City as one of two Creative Cities of Film this year, the other one being Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. Around the same time, Dumaguete City also got named as the UNESCO Creative City of Literature, while other Philippine cities that earned the nod from United Nations’ cultural arm the past years include Baguio (Crafts and Folk Arts in 2017), Cebu (Design in 2019), and Iloilo (Gastronomy in 2023). “He pointed out that what’s been achieved by QCIFF — plus its vital role in the history of Philippine cinema — checks all the boxes for Quezon City to be designated as Creative City of Film,” Lejano told Rappler. Lejano presented the idea to Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte, noting that although QCinema was “a relatively young festival, it had already made an impact in the Southeast Asian region.” There are only two Asian Creative Cities of Film: Busan, South Korea and Yamagata, Japan. But Lejano said it was just fitting for Quezon City to make a pitch as “QCinema has been the rising star and has been considered as one of the top festivals in Asia.” “Mayor Joy enlisted the efforts of the QC Film Commission for the arduous task [of applying to be a UNESCO Creative City],” Lejano added. Manet Dayrit, president of the QCinema Film Foundation and president/CEO of post production company Central Digital Lab, said the campaign was spearheaded by Liza Diño, the executive director of the Quezon City Film Commission (QCFC). “The QCFC team worked tirelessly for about two years on the application and campaign. QCinema and the local film community were proud to support their efforts,” Dayrit shared. “This recognition truly reflects Quezon City’s long-standing role as the heart of Philippine cinema.” The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) endorses only two Creative Cities a year. While 30 other cities applied last year, only Quezon City and Dumaguete City made it. QCFCs Diño and her team “plus the valuable assistance of Ivan Henares of the UNESCO National Commission of the Philippines (UNACOM) put together a winning strategy to clinch the honor,” Lejano noted. Historically, Lejano said, Quezon City is the true hub of the industry; being the site of 60% of the country’s total cineplexes. And by framing QCinema as “its key component in international impact,” he noted that their efforts truly “paid off.” Even back when Diño was chair of the Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP), the council partnered with the QC local government on projects. Diño became part of the board of QCIFF in 2022. “Mayor had already envisioned…QC as a film capital,” Diño said. “They both had been eyeing the UNESCO Creative City of Film. Upon the return of Mayor Joy (from Busan) two years ago, the local chief executive expressed her wish for QC to apply for 2025.” When Diño officially became the head of the city’s film commission in March 2023, she said they “reviewed the existing policy” and “built the commission from the ground up.” “We created programs,” she said, adding they also drafted and updated ordinances related to QCFC. “The UNESCO Philippine Commission was a big help,” Diño said, adding, “It was really more of a collaboration.” They started with the QCinema Project Market, launched the QCinema Industry Program, and also conducted workshops, master classes, conferences and labs. While Lejano took charge of everything about the festival, such as [programming], screenings, and everything related to culture, the commission was like the “industry arm” that brought “the business and industry together.” In a nutshell, Diño said, “The application was a full, two-year campaign involving policy groundwork, inter-agency alignment, ecosystem building, and industry programs that strengthened QC’s position.” The theme for this year’s 13th edition of QCinema is “Film City,” chosen before the announcement from UNESCO. “[Quezon City] as Film City [is] our way of manifesting this UNESCO honor of being a Creative City for Film, a first for the Philippines and also for Southeast Asia (together with Ho Chi Minh City),” Lejano said. “We’re over the moon that…our way of manifesting [the Film City theme] certainly paid off handsomely,” he beamed. “Being named a UNESCO Creative City of Film is both a proud moment and a meaningful challenge,” Dayrit said. “It inspires us at QCinema to keep nurturing our filmmakers and to strengthen Quezon City’s position as a true creative hub for film and storytelling, locally and globally.” The 13th edition of QCinema, which opened with the film Couture starring Angelina Jolie, runs until November 23. “Many of this year’s selections reflect on the art of filmmaking itself: cinema about cinema, stories about storytellers, and the power of moving images to reshape how we see the world,” the organizers said. Making its debut is Dokyu Days, QCinema’s new nonfiction showcase dedicated to powerful and thought-provoking documentaries “that spark dialogue and social change.” Organized by Filipino Documentary Society (FilDocs) with Dakila, QCFC and FAP, it features a “stellar lineup of local and international documentarists, industry professionals, and journalists,” who will delve into advocacy discussions, case studies, and the importance of nonfiction storytelling. Countries from Southeast Asia, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America are represented across the different sections. “Part of our program for this year includes films about films and filmmakers; films that study…our relationship with these stories…told on screen,” Lejano said. “We will see people behind the camera, trying to capture something true through their lenses [and getting] that truth across to the public. We will see people affected by those truths, their lives changed by what they glean from these moving images.” – Rappler.com",True,true,How Quezon City earned the UNESCO Creative City of Film honor,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/quezon-city-unesco-creative-film-honor/,Rappler

"TOKYO, Japan – A dozen women in sports bras and tight shorts stood behind a U-shaped counter at an underground bar in a busy Tokyo neighbourhood, chiselled frames on full display as they crushed grapefruit in unison with their bare hands. The music blared and neon lights flickered against a hot-pink backdrop as customers at fitness-themed bar Muscle Girls whooped and cheered in a scramble to capture the ritual on smartphones. “Most people in Japan generally consider women with small breasts, a slender back and skinny legs as attractive,” said Hitomi Harigae, manager of the bar, which features only women performers. “The customers who come here are different.” With its challenge to Japan’s conventional ideals of feminine beauty, the bar, which opened in mid-2020, draws about 100 customers on average each day, the majority of them foreign tourists, and has gone viral on social media. A fee of 6,000 yen ($40) for 80 minutes covers a protein drink and all-you-can-drink beverages while staff flaunting muscle-toned physiques, put on a stage show, and others, in leopard-print bikinis, smile through pull-ups and pole-dancing. Customers can also pay for extras, such as being slapped hard across the face or hoisted up by the thighs. “Femininity can be muscular and it doesn’t have to be defined by being dainty and small and quiet and not taking up space,” said Aubrey Lee, a tourist from Los Angeles. Among major developed nations, Japan has the highest share of underweight adult women, at about 9%, or almost five times counterparts in the United States and Germany, in terms of the body mass index, the OECD grouping says. This year, a Japanese panel of doctors and academics studying obesity warned that the convention of equating women’s thinness with beauty leads to malnutrition and other health problems that need to be tackled. But that “norm” is defied by the 30-odd women who work at Muscle Girls, passionate about bodybuilding and CrossFit, some of whom show off six-pack muscles that would shame many men. “I remember to this day when I first realised that I was fine just as I was, and how my self-esteem shot up,” Harigae, 38, said of her early days in the bar. For her, Muscle Girls is a godsend that fosters a sense of sisterhood as the women exchange diet and training tips. Even on days off, Harigae goes to all-you-can-eat buffets and nail salons with colleagues. Female bodybuilding has gained popularity in Japan in recent years, with competitions held in many cities. But outside that circle, the old conventions rule, Harigae said. “When I talk to friends from my school days, I still very much sense that they are wedded to those fixed ideas – they want to be thin,” she added. However, those views, partially drawn from gender stereotypes, could be changing, even if slowly. A 2023 survey by think tank Dentsu Soken showed 38.2% of respondents saying “Men should be manly and women should be womanly”, down from 43.7% in 2021. “Beauty in women isn’t just about being thin,” said Yuka Moriya, who joined the bar in 2023, and is inspired by coworkers passionate about bodybuilding, pole dancing, or simply being physically active. “I wish more people would appreciate the beauty of muscle,” added Moriya, a bodybuilder who aspires to win competitions and eventually become the best in Japan.

"Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer: Our Aunt Helen died on December 28 last year. She was the one who took care of us when our parents died. She was a single woman and raised all three of us as her own. She was buried on December 31, 2025, at 11:30 pm. My eldest brother (Kuya Arnold) arranged it all, so our aunt “will go with the sound of trumpets — actually, firecrackers — welcoming her home as she flies to Heaven.” My younger brother (Philip) and I very much disagreed. We felt our aunt deserved a respectful, focused burial, and should not have to compete with the nation’s celebrating the new year in this God-forsaken land where nothing will ever change. We tried to reason with Kuya Arnold, but he insisted on his way. He is paying for everything, so he feels he has the right to insist. Also, we were taught to follow him. All our other relatives agree that he knows best because he is the eldest. Kuya Arnold loved this authority he had over us, for no other reason than his being older. The more upset Kuya Philip and I were because of this, the more he insisted we “respect” him. When we got older, we left my aunt’s place as soon as we could afford it. I still live in a rented house, but at least I can choose how I want to live. Same with Kuya Philip. In fact, we had not seen my brother until my aunt’s death. His behavior just confirms why it was best to avoid him all this time. Please tell us how to deal with him. – OLGA Dear Olga, Thank you for your email. Hierarchy and its demands are as old as human society. Hierarchy pervades our social lives, our work lives, and indeed outlives us, e.g., primogeniture, the right or custom whereby the firstborn (often the male) inherits their parents’ estate or even their throne. It is very common here in the Philippines, as your account illustrates. Hierarchy is the natural order of things in areas like government, the armed forces, and business, but less obviously in the family. Of course, age is an important factor when siblings are growing up — the older the sibling, the more developed both physically and mentally (in most cases). However, the patterns of childhood tend to persist into adulthood, and deference/respect is frequently a factor governing family relationships from cradle to grave. Your family, Olga, appears to be no different to many others in this respect. Your elder brother Arnold revels in his role as the head of your family, based solely on the fact that he is the firstborn, and indeed he is supported in this by the rest of your family, except for your aunt. Up to now, the way you and your younger brother have dealt with this is to live separate lives and have as little to do with Arnold as possible. As far as we know, this has worked out well for you both but now, with your aunt’s death, you face a united opposition with no one to support you. The best option therefore may be to be pragmatic and recognize that this is a battle you cannot win. Arnold has the family on his side and the money to carry out his plans. Instead, you and your younger brother should honor your aunt in your own way and then carry on as before, keeping as much distance from Arnold as you possibly can. Best wishes, JAFBaer Dear Olga, Thank you very much for your letter. I am so sorry about Kuya Arnold’s behavior. I am even sorrier that you and your Kuya Philip had to be frustrated all over again because of his decisions and his “antics,” especially since he upset you at a time when dealing with your aunt’s death was difficult enough. I say this even if I don’t know how many there were and how absurd they may have come across to you, but it sounds like your Kuya’s deciding your aunt should be buried at 11:30 pm on December 31 is one of them. It is also possible that your Kuya Arnold purposely chose the time and date of the funeral because he had a feeling this is what would upset you most. This realization won’t erase what happened in 2025, but I hope it will help you look at his behavior from another perspective. Definitely, his behavior can be classified as assh*le, i.e., since his choices seem to depend on what reaction he can get out of you both. However, his behavior is also pathetic, as he cannot seem to make a choice independent of you both. You would think a mature person would choose integrity, the inherent rightness of the situation, and kindness as guides to his behavior, rather than what would piss off his siblings most. In that sense, parang he seems more kawawa (a figure to be pitied) than threatening. It is also possible for adult children to behave the way they used to when they were younger. Was your brother a bully when he was younger? Is it possible that the grief you all experienced during your aunt’s cremation reactivated these old dynamics, reminding him (and you) of unresolved childhood conflicts? You and your brother have chosen to live far away from your brother because of his personality and family expectations. I hope his behavior and your reactions confirm that you made the best decision. Admittedly, this may seem small consolation at such a time, but reminding yourself of this (and of his kawawa-ness) may ease a little of the aggravation you and your brother may still be experiencing.

"MANILA, Philippines – A Filipino feast will never be complete without a wide array of sauces and condiments. It’s the “sawsawan culture,” with dips like vinegar, soy sauce, sweet chili, ketchup, fish sauce, and their assortment of combos, often found on Filipino tables. And if you love the spicy kind, the Fire Fest 2025 will definitely be a feast for the palate as hundreds of bottles and jars of hot sauces and condiments will be served from October 4 to 5 at the Renaissance Convention Center in Marikina. Chef Gene Gonzalez, who collaborated with the Philippine Hot Sauce Club during the event kickoff in September, picked early strong contenders: the Ghost Pepper and Carolina Reaper. “When you try it the first time, it won’t knock your brain cells just yet. It’s interesting. You have to wait 15 seconds before it hits you,” said Gonzalez. “It expands in your palate and it will drive you wild in a good way.” In this weekend’s Fire Fest, there will be a Table of Fire, a long, free-for-all buffet featuring almost 450 types of hot sauces and spicy condiments from the Fiery Cup 7 competition. The event will culminate with the Fiery Cup 7 Awarding, which honors the best in chili and spicy creations in different categories; a Fire Fest BBQ Cup, a grilling competition pitting top pitmasters; and the First Chili Cocktail Cup, a mixology battle showcasing innovative spicy cocktails. During the event kickoff, Gonzalez and his team offered a sneak peek, curating an impeccable selection of hot sauces from different brands and makers, and meticulously pairing them with local dishes: “We checked and we’re one of the largest competition of hot sauce in Asia, pertaining to the number of entries received. In the world, we rank sixth or seventh,” said Eric del Rosario, co-founder of the Philippine Hot Sauce Club. But competition aside, the event also gathers the different hot sauce organizations in the country. Ponchit Ponce Enrile, a business owner from Negros, is one of the pioneers of the community that includes the Philippine Chili Federation, Sili PInas, and Chili Growers Philippines, among others. “With the growing number of groups… I put up a federation wherein we’re all together and to also unite everyone under one umbrella,” he said. Del Rosario shared that there are other clubs like Labuyo, who are hardcore collectors of hot sauces, and Labuyo 100, where members must be able to consume 100 pieces of chilis within 15 minutes.

"(This is a press release from the Philippine Association of University Women-UP Chapter) The University of the Philippines’ flagship cultural program Tanghal Tertulia emerged as one of three winners in the much-coveted Best Special Events Production category at the 38th Aliw Awards, held at the Fiesta Pavilion of The Manila Hotel on Monday, December 15. Tanghal Tertulia distinguished itself as the only special event mounted by an educational institution of higher learning to be shortlisted and ultimately recognized in this highly competitive category — underscoring UP’s leadership in advancing arts and culture on the national stage. Launched in 2024, Tanghal Tertulia traces its origin to an inspired evening at the UP Executive House Amphitheater, when UP President Angelo Jimenez delivered an impromptu poetry performance, moved by the swaying bamboo trees and the twinkling stars under a clear night sky. That moment sparked a vision for a regular artistic gathering honoring UP’s National Artists. Jimenez then tasked Fina Dela Cuesta Tantuico of the UP Philippine Association of University Women to convene an ad hoc committee to conceptualize a program that would celebrate UP’s creative legacy and inspire new generations of Iskolars ng Bayan. The name “Tanghal Tertulia,” coined by Professor Emeritus Jose “Butch” Dalisay, draws from the Spanish tradition of the tertulia — a gathering for literary and artistic exchange. “When we set up Tanghal Tertulia, we did not set out to win any awards. In fact, our motivations were far more modest,“ said Jimenez. “Sitting as we do on a powder keg of creative talent, it was impossible not to ignore the fact that 44 of the country’s 81 National Artists came from UP. Tanghal Tertulia was our way of putting a spotlight on that legacy, and of sharing it generously with the public. We accept this award on behalf of mga Artista ng Bayan at mga Iskolar ng Bayan. UP Fight!” Tanghal Tertulia is made possible through the collaborative leadership of Atty. Fina Dela Cuesta Tantuico (VP for Public Relations, UP Philippine Association of University Women); Dr. Patricia Brillantes Silvestre (Dean, UP College of Music); Toym Imao (Dean, UP College of Fine Arts and Chair, UP President’s Committee on Culture and the Arts); Dr. Grace Javier Alfonso (Executive Director, TVUP); and Atty. Edlyn Frances V. Verzola (President, UP-PAUW), whose collective vision and stewardship have transformed the program into a nationally lauded cultural institution. Joining Tanghal Tertulia in the winners’ circle for Best Special Events Production are “That’s Amore – RMA” and “JL 75th – The Beatles Concert” — both ticketed, commercial productions. In contrast, Tanghal Tertulia stands apart as a free cultural offering that is open to the public, reaffirming UP’s mission to democratize access to the arts and bring artistic excellence to the widest possible audience. Building on this milestone, preparations are now underway for the next edition of Tanghal Tertulia on February 21, 2026, which will honor three more living National Artists from the University of the Philippines, continuing UP’s enduring commitment to celebrating artistic excellence and inspiring future generations through the transformative power of the arts. – Rappler.com",True,true,UP’s Tanghal Tertulia recognized in 38th Aliw Awards,https://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/contests-awards/university-philippines-tanghal-tertulia-aliw-awards-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The latest addition to Sunlight Air’s fleet has finally landed. The boutique airline on Friday, October 24, welcomed its first ATR 72-600 turboprop plane, the fourth aircraft in its turboprop fleet. The newer, bigger plane also spots Sunlight Air’s refurbished livery and logo. Sunlight Air’s newest aircraft has a seating capacity of 68 passengers and emits less carbon emissions per passenger as it burns 45% less fuel. The plane also contains advanced noise insulation and fewer seats to provide more legroom to its passengers. Passengers of the boutique airline may spot this new plane on its maiden flight on Sunday, October 26. It will service Sunlight’s Clark-Siargao, Siargao-Cebu, Cebu-Busuanga, and Busuanga-Clark routes. For Sunlight Air’s chief executive officer Ryna Brito-Garcia, the newest aircraft to their fleet aims to bring the boutique aviation experience to more passengers on its short-haul regional flights. “It aligns with our goal to continuously improve our services and expand our route offerings, connecting more travelers to beloved island destinations while showcasing Sunlight Air’s signature hospitality,” she said. Garcia, the country’s only female commercial airline chief, also underscored the carrier’s goal of connecting travelers to underrated destinations in the Philippines. “This new ATR 72-600 will allow us to serve you better, continue connecting communities that deserve better access, and beautiful islands that deserve better awareness,” she said. Sunlight is also set to launch its Cebu-Siquijor route in December, making the boutique airline the first to offer direct commercial flights to the island province. The carrier will be operating flights between Cebu and Siquijor four times a week.

"MANILA, Philippines – Every October, pink ribbons remind women to get screened and checked for breast cancer. But behind the Breast Cancer Awareness Month campaigns lies a dire statistic: more Filipino women are being diagnosed with breast cancer than ever before. In 2022, around 33,000 Filipino women were newly diagnosed with breast cancer, making it the most common cancer among women in the Philippines. Our country’s rate is among the highest in Asia, which is a cause for alarm. For every 100,000 women, about 60 Filipinas are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, while the average in Southeast Asia is around 42, and across Asia, about 34. To put it in perspective, nearly one million of the 2.3 million new breast cancer cases worldwide come from Asia alone. The fact that the Philippines’ rate is significantly higher than the regional average shows that Filipino women face a greater risk. It’s something we should all be concerned about. But why is this happening? Dr. Diana O. Cua, a breast surgeon at Makati Medical Center and one of the first Filipino surgeons to train in breast surgery at Stanford University, said that one major cause is that lifestyles and family habits have shifted over the years. “Many women now have children later in life or have fewer children. More people are also living in cities, and rates of obesity are going up, all of which can raise the risk of breast cancer,” she told Rappler. But lifestyle isn’t the only culprit. Screening remains a weak spot in the country’s healthcare system. “Breast cancer screening in the Philippines is not yet fully organized. Most women get checked only when they visit a clinic for another reason,” said Cua. “There also aren’t enough mammogram machines in many areas, which means many cancers are still found at a later stage.” And as Filipino women live longer, more reach the age where breast cancer risk naturally increases. “Early diagnosis can be difficult because of travel, cost, and lack of proper guidance through the health system,” she added. “But in tertiary centers like MakatiMed and other hospitals, we’re seeing more women diagnosed at early stages — and because they receive full treatment, most go on to be completely cured.” Across ASEAN countries, the Philippines ranks among those with the highest breast cancer rates, alongside Singapore. More women are developing risk factors such as obesity, hormonal changes, and later pregnancies, Cua said. Filipinos also face slow medical access and financial barriers. “Studies have found that low access to mammograms and delays in diagnosis and treatment lead to more advanced cases and higher death rates,” said Cua. “The challenge is twofold: more women are at risk, and many still cannot get tested or treated early. Solving both problems is key to saving more lives.” However, even women diagnosed early often face “catastrophic health expenses within a year,” said Cua. “Many need to travel far for tests or treatment. Some hospitals still lack imaging or biopsy services, and there aren’t enough cancer specialists in many areas.” PhilHealth’s Z-Benefit package now covers more treatments, raising financial coverage to P1.4 million, but gaps remain. Only select hospitals offer the Z package, and the process can still be long and bureaucratic. “Outside big cities, patient navigation — someone guiding you through the system — is still hit or miss,” Cua said. “These hurdles lead to delays and treatment breaks, which can seriously affect recovery.” One troubling trend Cua has observed is that more young women are being diagnosed with breast cancer. Some of these cancers are more aggressive. “Many of my patients in their 30s and 40s are very proactive. They feel a lump, get it checked, and are diagnosed early. These are the women with highly curable Stage 1 or 2 cancers,” she said. “But I also see a few young women who are in denial, and by the time they come in, the cancer has already spread.” Younger women, she added, face unique challenges after treatment, such as fertility issues and emotional recovery. There needs to be more age-sensitive support systems in cancer care, Cua said. There isn’t one sure cause for breast cancer risk. There are various controllable and uncontrollable factors, including genetics. “In the Philippines, about 1 in every 20 women with breast cancer has inherited mutations in genes like BRCA1 or BRCA2,” said Cua. “If breast cancer runs in your family, it’s worth asking your doctor about genetic testing.” Still, she emphasized that lifestyle remains a major area where women can take control. Women today tend to have children later, move less, and consume more processed food. Obesity, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol also raise hormonal risks over time. “The best thing we can do is take care of our overall health — eat real food, move often, and maintain a healthy weight,” she said. While breast self-exams (BSE) are often promoted as a life-saving habit, Cua explained that the data paints a more nuanced picture. “BSE alone doesn’t actually lower breast cancer deaths; it can even cause unnecessary panic or extra tests,” she said. “What we should focus on is breast awareness: knowing what’s normal for your body so you can spot changes early.” The best formula involves mammograms and ultrasounds, paired with immediate medical consultation when something feels off. “It’s not just about having more machines — it’s about making care accessible and helping women understand what to do next,” she said. “Awareness should lead to action.” Despite the grim picture, Cua is optimistic that progress is possible. Cheaper versions of key cancer drugs like trastuzumab have made targeted therapies more affordable, she shared. Newer treatments such as CDK4/6 inhibitors and immunotherapy are also extending lives. Diagnostic tools have improved, too; more patients are receiving core-needle biopsies and hormone receptor testing, allowing doctors to design more personalized care plans. On a global level, there’s also policy progress, with the World Health Organization (WHO), World Bank, USAID, Europe, and Japan pushing to increase their budget allocation for breast cancer. “Breast cancer will soon be recognized as a global health priority under the 2025 United Nations Political Declaration on Non-Communicable Diseases,” Cua shared. “This means more international funding and stronger government accountability, and a step forward for women everywhere.” To truly reduce breast cancer deaths, Cua believes the Philippines needs stronger early-detection pathways, expanded access to screening, and simplified treatment systems. “It’s not enough to tell women to get checked,” she said. “We need to bring care closer to them, especially outside Metro Manila, and make sure benefit packages keep up with new evidence.” At the end of the day, it’s about how we can turn awareness into access, and access into action. It is a community effort. “When all these pieces come together — early detection, equitable care, and financial support — that’s when we’ll start seeing fewer deaths from breast cancer,” Cua said. “Not because of one single fix, but because we finally made the system work for women.” – Rappler.com Dr. Diana Cua is a board-certified medical oncologist at The Medical City and an active member of the Philippine Society of Medical Oncology (PSMO).

"MANILA, Philippines – Unemployment improved for a second consecutive month to 3.8% in September as the construction industry added more jobs to the economy, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said on Thursday, November 6. The latest jobless rate translates to around 1.96 million Filipinos. This is lower than the 3.9% or 2.03 million jobless Filipinos tallied in August but higher than the 3.7% or 1.89 million unemployed Filipinos in September 2024. Meanwhile, underemployment worsened in September at 11.1% or 5.52 million Filipinos. This is higher than the 10.7% or 5.38 million underemployed Filipinos in August, but lower than the 11.9% or 5.94 million underemployed Filipinos in August. The construction sector saw the largest increase in employment in September, adding 514,000 jobs since September 2024. National Statistician Dennis Mapa highlighted gains in the jobs related to the construction of buildings, plumbing, and air conditioning installation, as well as the construction of utility projects. However, Mapa noted that the construction sector was also one of the reasons why underemployment figures increased. This means the jobs added to the sector may only be temporary ones. “So posible na may mga workers, but a number or a portion of the workers hindi nagkaroon ng 40-hour job. Some of them are hired, let’s say, as a temporary hand or partial lang ‘yung kanilang work done in that particular week,” he explained. (So it’s possible that there are workers, but a number or a portion of the workers are not working 40 hours a week. Some of them are hired, let’s say, as a temporary hand or their work was only partially done in that particular week.) Mapa added that the flood control scandal might have contributed to the month-on-month reduction of construction jobs. The Department of Public Works and Highways paused bidding for infrastructure projects for nearly two weeks in September. As for job losses, the PSA found that other service activities such as domestic work (-493,000 jobs) shed the most jobs in September. Mapa said the shedding of jobs in domestic work is often tied to household income. He noticed that jobs in domestic work are often added when households make more money. The manufacturing sector also continued to bleed jobs as the industry contracted for the first time in six months in September, according to data from the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Purchasing Managers Index. “New orders and output decreased slightly as firms mentioned a fall in client numbers and a modest drop in production from the suspension of rice imports,” S&P Global Market Intelligence senior economist David Owen said. The Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) said the latest job figures reflect the Philippine labor market’s “resilience” despite headwinds. DEPDev Secretary Arsenio Balisacan underscored the importance of implementing interventions to create more stable, high-quality jobs for the informal sector and the youth. The country’s chief economist cited the recent passage of the Lifelong Learning Development Framework Act, which creates a system for continuing education. “Ensuring the timely release of its implementing rules and regulations is a priority. The government must also actively communicate the policy, particularly to local government units, which will play a key role in promoting lifelong learning,” Balisacan said. – Rappler.com",True,true,Construction job gains push down unemployment to 3.8% in September 2025,https://www.rappler.com/business/unemployment-rate-philippines-september-2025/,Rappler
"(This is a press release from the Manila Electric Company.) MANILA, Philippines – After a P0.1852 per kilowatt hour (kWh) reduction last month, the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) announced on Monday, October 15, an upward adjustment of P0.2331 per kWh for October. This brings the overall rate for a typical household to P13.3182 per kWh this month from P13.0851 per kWh. For residential customers consuming 200 kWh, the adjustment is equivalent to an additional P47 in their total electricity bill. Coming from a P0.2603 per kWh reduction last month, the October generation charge went up by P0.1903 per kWh. Charges from Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and Power Supply Agreements (PSAs) increased by P0.3622 and P0.3567 per kWh, respectively, primarily due to the depreciation of the local currency against the US dollar, which affected 99% and 48% of their respective costs. This month’s generation charge also reflected the impact of the interim extension of Meralco’s power purchase agreement with First Gas-Sta. Rita plant as approved by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC). The increase was tempered by lower charges from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) that went down by P2.0688 per kWh owing to a decrease of about 1,000 MW in Luzon’s peak demand. IPPs, PSAs, and WESM accounted for 21%, 74%, and 5%, respectively, of Meralco’s total energy requirement for the period. Transmission, taxes, and other charges also registered a total increase of P0.0428 per kWh. Pass-through charges for generation and transmission are paid by Meralco to the power suppliers and the grid operator, respectively, while taxes, universal charges, and Feed-in Tariff Allowance are all remitted to the government. Meralco reiterates that its distribution charge, on the other hand, has not moved since the P0.0360 per kWh reduction for a typical residential customer beginning August 2022. Customers also continue to benefit from the ongoing implementation of the distribution-related true-up adjustment, equivalent to a reduction of P0.2024 per kWh for residential customers. With the recent earthquakes affecting parts of the country, Meralco assured its customers that it continuously safeguards its distribution facilities from potential hazards to ensure the safety of both of its crews and customers. Among the safety measures the power distributor implements include replacing wooden poles with taller and more durable concrete or steel ones, relocating facilities away from high-risk areas such as railroad tracks and waterways, and conducting regular tree trimming and wire clearing operations to manage foreign attachments on power lines. The company also implements re-insulation and conductor shielding of power lines, enhancing of lightning protection systems, and installing of smart devices to swiftly identify and isolate service concerns. Meralco also stands ready to de-energize power if the situation warrants it to protect the public. Likewise, Meralco enjoins customers to continue observing electrical safety measures to be better prepared for disasters and avoid accidents. These include unplugging appliances when not in use, regularly inspecting electrical cords for damage, and knowing the location of the main electrical switch for quick access during emergencies. After an earthquake, and only if it is safe to do so, customers should turn off the main switch or breaker to prevent fire or electrocution, unplug devices to avoid further damage, and steer clear of any damaged equipment or downed power lines. Electrical hazards should also be reported to Meralco. – Rappler.com",True,true,Meralco rates go up in October due to higher generation charge,https://www.rappler.com/business/meralco-power-rates-october-2025/,Rappler
"ROME, Italy – Italian cooking, already celebrated around the world, is poised for a new accolade: formal recognition as a cultural treasure from the United Nations’ cultural agency, UNESCO. A preliminary UNESCO assessment has cleared Italian cuisine to be added to UNESCO’s ‘Intangible Cultural Heritage’ lists and a final decision is expected on Wednesday. Launched in March 2023 by Italy’s agriculture and culture ministries, the bid casts Italian cuisine – from pasta and pizza to risotto and cannoli – as a social ritual that binds families and communities together. “There is no single Italian cuisine, but a mosaic of local expressive diversities,” the government said. From Lombardy’s ossobuco – braised veal shanks with gremolata, to Puglia’s orecchiette con cime di rapa – ear-shaped pasta with turnip greens, each region showcases Italian biodiversity and creativity, it said. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has championed the effort, calling Italian food a symbol of “culture, identity, tradition and strength.” Industry groups estimate UNESCO recognition could boost tourism by up to 8% in two years, adding 18 million overnight stays. Italian cuisine also connects 59 million residents with up to 85 million people of Italian descent worldwide. Globally, the Italian food service market hit 251 billion euros ($293 billion) in 2024, or 19% of the global restaurant market, Deloitte said. But imitation products abroad cost Italy an estimated 120 billion euros annually. Not everyone in Italy supports the bid to join UNESCO lists, which already feature almost 800 items including Italian opera singing and truffle hunting. Alberto Grandi, a food historian, called the UNESCO candidacy “just a marketing operation” in an interview with website Mantovauno last month. In his 2024 book La cucina italiana non esiste’ (‘Italian cuisine doesn’t exist’), Grandi argued that many dishes considered traditional, including pasta alla carbonara, are relatively modern inventions influenced by foreign cultures. Grandi’s remarks have sparked a backlash from farmers’ association Coldiretti, which called his claims “surreal attacks on national culinary tradition.” For restaurateurs like Luigina Pantalone, owner of Rome’s historic Da Sabatino, a UNESCO nod from Wednesday’s meeting in India would be a source of pride. “Authentic Italian cuisine needs to be protected,” she said, recalling childhood days washing dishes with her brothers and proudly noting that she is the fourth generation of her family to run the restaurant. Three-Michelin-star chef Massimo Bottura summed it up: “Italian cuisine is an ancient, daily, sacred ritual – the art of caring and loving without saying a word.” ($1 = 0.8590 euros) – Rappler.com",True,true,Beyond pizza and pasta: Italy’s culinary heritage awaits UNESCO nod,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/italy-culinary-heritage-awaits-unesco-nod/,Rappler
"It’s the start of a new year again, which means that it’s time for another clean slate. The beginning of the year is a chance to start fresh. It’s an opportunity for you to reset the certain aspects of your life that you aren’t satisfied with — whether that’s through listing down your New Year’s resolutions, decluttering your space, or doing one big clean-up to simulate that feeling of starting over. But many people look for some form of guidance when they turn a new leaf, and one of the most common ways is through the practice of tarot. While tarot has yet to be widely accepted in the Philippines, there are a myriad of Filipino practitioners dedicated to keeping the art alive, and showing curious onlookers that it can be a guiding force for good. Among them are Pau of Paghilom and Rob Rubin of Mysterium Philippines, who both offer tarot readings for clients looking to face the new year head-on. Tarot is a form of cartomancy that typically uses a deck of 78 cards that each correspond to a specific archetype, though there are some instances where readers would interpret cards differently when they come out in reverse. For Pau, tarot reading comes intuitively to her, in contrast with the readers who often take a predictive approach to it. She makes it a point to get in tune with the energy of her clients, as this helps her accomplish a reading that gets down to what’s weighing on their minds. “I use [tarot] personally and for my clients as well. [I do an] intuitive reading of the energies of the client or myself together with the archetypes of the cards,” shared Pau, who started her tarot practice in 2018 while she was still working as a teacher. When reading tarot, Pau explained that the circumstances surrounding the client also matters — from the people around them to their experiences, what they’re feeling at the moment, and the emotions dominating their mood. A post shared by tarot reading, crystals, reiki healing 🧿 (@paghilom__) “I trigger introspection with my clients so at the same time I’m reading the cards, they’re also reading into their [own] energies, emotions, and also their mindsets during times of confusion. Because it’s very important that my tarot reading is participative.” Meanwhile, Rob describes tarot as a tool for empowerment. He emphasizes that while tarot can give you a blueprint to explore what you can achieve as an individual, no reading is ever set in stone. “If you want clarity, you want to understand the unknowns, the options, the possibilities, the promises, the potentials, you can have a tarot reading because that’s going to give you clarity of the issues that are important to you — be it career, love life, spirituality, ambition. All of it is pretty much addressable in the tarot. This golden rule we say in tarot, though, is we do not predict dates of death,” explained Rob, who started his tarot journey around three decades ago at 14 years old. A tarot reading, no matter what aspect of your life it covers, can still change over time. The same goes for New Year readings. It’s normal to look for some sort of guidance when we welcome a new chapter in our lives. We have all these past experiences that have brought us years’ worth of life lessons and opportunities for character development, yet we sometimes don’t know what to do with them. This is where tarot comes in — and it’s more common than you think. According to Pau, in the five years that she’s offered her reading services online, the “year ahead” reading remains to be her most availed one. Her clients would often start booking sessions as early as October the year before, up to February of the succeeding year to gain insight into how they can go into the new year with peace of mind. Pau would always use two spreads for these kinds of readings. First is the thematic one, which covers an individual’s reflective energy based on their greatest lessons from the previous year, and how all these would connect to their aspirations for the coming year. “It’s very reflective in terms of how your habits can affect the different aspects of your life for the next year. So they discuss your love life, career, finances, spirituality, health, well-being, and the possibility of the energies based on your current energies. It’s reflective to the point that it tells you, ‘Okay, because these are your habits, these are your possibilities,’” Pau explained in a mix of English and Filipino. If you’re looking to see changes or movement in your life, this spread will tell you what can happen based on your current energies. But if you want something different, you will know that you have to make radical changes in your energies — because the spread has shown you your current capacities. A post shared by tarot reading, crystals, reiki healing 🧿 (@paghilom__) The other spread is the monthly one, which covers how an individual would plan for the next 12 months of the new year based on the possibilities that can happen then. This spread will still rely on your current energies, but it will dig deeper into what exactly can happen to you this year as Pau will also discuss the internal and external forces that come into play. It will make you aware of the forces you can’t control, and the factors that you can still change. These things are laid out for each month. The kind of “year ahead” reading that works best for you will depend on your own priorities for the coming year. Do you want to have a guide for each month of your life? Consider getting the monthly spread. Do you crave reflection and making sense of your energies? Maybe the thematic spread is for you. Rob, meanwhile, offers to his VIP clients what he refers to as an “annual forecast,” where he forms a roadmap for the next 12 months of their lives. During the reading, Rob would also determine the energy a client would have for each month, and would then provide them with a guide to plan their year. “For example, you want to get married in June, but in that month, during the reading, we see there’s nothing but bad cards there. Then, we might tell you, ‘Hey, let’s not do that in June because we don’t want to be part of that kind of energy,’” Rob said. Every tarot practitioner is different. Pau deems it important for her clients to go into her readings already knowing what they want to gain insight into. It doesn’t have to be specific — just a gist of it all can work. Often, the querent can just tell Pau that they’re feeling confused in life and don’t know what to do, and she can take it from there. “For me, intention is very important. Kaya tawag ko sa mga questions ng mga querents would be intentions. What are your intentions in this reading? Kung wala kang specific question, ano na lang ‘yung ba’t ka nandito?” Pau shared. (For me, intention is very important. It’s why I refer to the questions of my querents as intentions. What are your intentions in this reading? If you don’t have a specific question, tell me instead why you are here.) The same thing goes for Pau’s “year ahead” readings, where she would ask clients what happened in the last 12 months leading to the reading, along with what their goals or intentions are given these experiences. Some clients opt to be extra-specific, while others prefer to keep it a bit more general. But for Pau, anything goes. Rob, meanwhile, takes a different approach. For him, his clients don’t even have to say anything. “You just need to tell me you need to have the reading and then we’ll set it up. And I always highly suggest to my clients that we have it on Zoom so you can have a full recording because it’s a lot of information. It looks at the year per month. It doesn’t matter if you have an idea or not,” he told Rappler. When he starts roadmapping each month of the year, he would tell his clients what they should and should not be doing, and what their options are. A post shared by Robert Rubin Tarot Readings 𓃤 (@robrubinreadings) But tarot readings — above all else — are supposed to empower you. They aren’t supposed to be fatalistic and shouldn’t dictate your life. It’s supposed to give the power back to you rather than the other way around. “If I told you tomorrow that no matter what you do, it’s set in stone, you’re going to Solaire and you’re going to gamble away all your money and become bankrupt. What are you going to tell me? You’re going to say, ‘Then guess who’s not going to Solaire tomorrow?’ A real reader will give the power back to you,” Rob said as an example. And in 2026, as a general outlook, Rob attests that you can get what you want this year, but you need to work for it. The card for 2026 is The Chariot — which symbolizes victory. “With the card being the chariot for the year, you can get your heart’s desire this year. You just need to be willing to put in the work for it. If this is the year you say you want to lose weight, this can be the year you lose weight, but you must be willing to pay the price for it. You must be willing to put in the effort. Don’t just be idle about this,” he said. According to Rob, the energy that 2026 brings is drastically different from that of 2025. “The end of 2025 was very, very morbid. There were a lot of deaths because it’s the snake year. It’s like the snake shedding its skin before it’s over. After it sheds its skin, once 2026 starts, then everything’s going to start moving fast-paced. It’s the Year of the Horse as well. Horses and chariots [are related to each other], so it’s really in alignment,” Rob said. That said, keep a positive mindset that 2026 can be a great year for you. If there’s a big goal you want to achieve, perhaps tarot can help give you that foresight and peace of mind. – Rappler.com",True,true,Heal and take action: How tarot reading can help you plan for the year ahead,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/how-tarot-reading-help-plan-year-ahead/,Rappler
"Last week, on November 7, the latest statistics on national income turned out to be a real shocker. For the third quarter of 2025, production only grew by a measly 4% from the previous year. This is the lowest quarterly growth rate of the country since 2011 (if you don’t count the pandemic). This is also very low compared to the target of the economic managers. Back in 2022, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. targeted growth this year to be 6–8%. But when that proved unattainable, his economic managers lowered the target to 5.5–6.5%. Now, even 5.5% seems to be a moonshot: to achieve that, production in the last quarter of 2025 will have to grow by 7%! Palace spokesperson Claire Castro somehow insists this can still be done — a case of what I might call “delulunomics.” If you break down of the data, you’ll see that the third quarter of 2025 is also notable as the first quarter since the pandemic where the growth contribution of investment spending dropped. In other words, investment spending pulled down growth. A further parsing of the data will reveal that this is also the second consecutive quarter where government construction spending slumped and pulled down total investments. You might interpret this as the government being a lot more cautious in public works spending, amid the flood control scandal that President Marcos himself announced to the world back in July. This brings to mind the administration of the late Benigno Aquino III, whose anti-corruption slogan meant overly cautious government spending in the early 2010s. (This prompted them to implement the Disbursement Acceleration Program or DAP, later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.) One wonders: How much of economic growth is being propped up by corrupt spending? If you take away corruption, will economic growth in the past few years have been a lot lower? Worse, is there a trade-off after all between growth and corruption? On the one hand, we’re seeing years where growth is high but corruption-ridden. On the other hand, growth is weaker because the government is stamping out corruption. Is it too much to ask for high and corruption-free growth? When asked about anemic growth, President Marcos said that other factors are at play, including the multiple class and work suspensions (owing to disasters) and the fallout of Trump’s tariffs. This echoes what his chief economist said a week prior. Sure, the effects of climate change are getting more intense (as evidenced by Typhoon Tino and Super Typhoon Uwan) and Trump’s tariffs are souring the global business environment. But there’s something broken in our own backyard, and it’s getting harder and harder to deny it. Other indicators of economic malaise include the historically weak peso. On November 14, the exchange rate reached P59.11 per US dollar (as of writing) and it seems the Bangko Sentral is not too worried to let the exchange rate cross the psychological threshold of P60 per US dollar. As I wrote last week, one reason for a weaker peso is stronger demand for dollars, and this usually happens when investors want to pick up their money and invest elsewhere. Data from the Bangko Sentral also reported a steep drop of foreign direct investments (FDI): a massive 40.5% drop from August 2024 to August 2025, and a similarly alarming 22.5% drop from January to August 2024 to the same period in 2025. I can’t help but remember the numerous foreign trips made by President Marcos at the start of his presidency, supposedly to attract investments. Years later, that would be undone by large-scale corruption that he allowed to fester. So those foreign trips were useless, after all, and proved to be mere junkets that “reintroduced” the Marcoses on the global stage. In many ways, it’s not so surprising that corruption is festering under yet another Marcos presidency. But it’s also unsurprising to see that his efforts so far to curb corruption have been weak as hell. On November 13, President Marcos appeared in a press conference to update the country about his anti-corruption drive. He boasted about the 20,000 or so complaints received on the online portal “Sumbong sa Pangulo,” and encouraged people to keep on filing reports about anomalous flood control projects. But in launching this website, the President essentially outsourced the investigation to citizens, when in fact his office should be able to scan all flood control projects and pinpoint those which have been corrupted. Remember, his office sits on top of billions of pesos worth of confidential and intelligence funds! More than receiving reports, people expect Marcos to jail the corrupt. But it’s been more than three months since his State of the Nation Address, and everyone is still scot-free. Former lawmaker Zaldy Co is still globetrotting, and former public works secretary Manuel Bonoan has flown to the US. When asked about his cousin Martin Romualdez, former speaker of the House of Representatives, architect of the corrupted national budgets since 2023, President Marcos could not have been more evasive. Instead, Marcos seems to be zeroing in on small-fry scapegoats such as the conjugal contractors, Sarah and Curlee Discaya. Here in the Philippines, it’s notoriously difficult to hold public officials accountable. Heck, Filipinos keep electing the corrupt or giving them even more power than before (think Imelda Marcos and Juan Ponce Enrile, who [finally] passed away yesterday at age 101). Don’t get your hopes up that the real masterminds in the flood control mess will be jailed. And don’t get your hopes up that our economy will magically recover any time soon. – Rappler.com (Editor’s note: This article was written before Zaldy Co, in a video released on Friday, November 14, tagged President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and former House speaker Martin Romualdez in corrupting the 2025 national budget.)

"On November 11, 2025, the De La Salle University (DLSU) Ramon V. del Rosario College of Business (RVRCOB) was awarded 4 Palmes of Excellence at the Eduniversal World Convention hosted by the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Indore at the Indore Marriott Hotel. This puts the DLSU RVRCOB in the top 20% of 1,000 ranked business schools worldwide. Eduniversal recognized the college’s programs that combine academic rigor with real-world business experience. The 4 Palmes recognize academic excellence and regional leadership through research, sustainability, and ethical business practices. By nurturing Lasallian business leaders who make a difference, RVRCOB advances global business education excellence. This award, though very much welcome, raises challenging questions for reflections. How does a school with international influence become a global force for good? The answer requires looking beyond our own achievements to learn from institutions that have wrestled with this question too. The convention, with the theme “Bridging Purpose and Performance: Business Education as a Force for Good,” opened with Professor Himanshu Rai’s remarks and keynote. As the director of IIM Indore, he explained the role of Indore and his business school in contributing to India’s nation-building efforts. His institution holds Triple Crown accreditation, ranks among the world’s top 1% of business schools, and sits on a 193-acre campus, and plays a vital role in the development of Indore. With the efforts of the local government, the school, and the citizens, Indore has been recognized as the India’s cleanest city for seven consecutive years. Moving to his keynote, Rai chose to ground ethical leadership lessons on Vedic wisdom and ancient Sanskrit texts. Rai connected Vedic wisdom to concrete leadership failures he’d witnessed: leaders who lost themselves in performance metrics, who deflected accountability when decisions went wrong, who operated below their capacity because they feared failure more than they valued excellence. Rai calls IIM Indore as “ancient yet agile.” The phrase captures something we need to understand. The school doesn’t treat its cultural heritage as decoration or as separate from “real” business education. Indian wisdom isn’t an elective. It’s the foundation that shapes how they think about leadership, how they structure experiential learning programs, and how they evaluate what counts as success. The Vedas and the Indian heritage are taught as business education, not alongside it. The case of IIM Indore is fascinating in its paradox: it honors its tradition, yet it is considered a top global school of tomorrow. How can Filipino business schools learn from this example? At RVRCOB, we have something similar: our Lasallian tradition and our Filipino values. But do we teach them as business education or merely adjacent to it? Context-wise, the Philippines and India share characteristics. Large populations, rapid growth, collectivist cultures, family business dominance. Colonial histories creating tension between indigenous wisdom and imported models. What if Philippine business schools integrate our respective values with our cultural heritage? What if RVRCOB combines Filipino concepts with Lasallian pedagogical discipline? Filipino psychology and philosophy provide rich cultural resources. The most relevant to management, I think, are the Filipino constructs I would label as “DKL” (in part because it can be read as “dakila”) — diwa, kapwa, and loob. Loob represents the inner self, the seat of volition and authentic conviction. Kapwa captures our relational nature, the recognition that self and other are fundamentally interconnected. Diwa points toward collective consciousness, the spirit that animates groups and organizations. Similar to how Rai drew from the wisdom of the Vedas, DKL describes how Filipinos actually experience and navigate the world. A manager who cultivates loob develops genuine conviction rather than performing what they think leadership should look like. A leader who practices kapwa builds organizations where people matter as people, not as human resources. An institution animated by diwa serves purposes that transcend narrow institutional interests. DLSU’s Lasallian Reflection Framework already provides a structured approach to values-based practice through Masid-Danas (See-Experience), Suri-Nilay (Analysis-Reflection), and Taya-Kilos (Commitment-Action). These aren’t just steps in a process. Masid-Danas means being mapagpansin, genuinely attentive to what’s actually happening, not what theories predict. Suri-nilay goes deeper than standard analysis, malalim (deep), seeking integrated understanding by engaging intellect and intuition together, the capacity to grasp situations holistically, to see patterns that pure logic might miss, to develop insights then validate them iteratively. Taya-kilos is where discernment becomes action, may pananagutan, completely accountable and responsible, not action for its own sake but movement that flows from genuine understanding. The path forward requires three shifts. First, Philippine business schools need to stop treating Filipino values as supplementary to “real” business education. They are our foundations for thinking about management, leadership, and organizational purpose. Second, we need to develop pedagogical approaches that genuinely integrate these values rather than just mentioning them. IIM Indore structures entire programs around their heritage, from their Rural Engagement Program to their Himalayan Outbound Program to their workshops on Mithila traditional art forms. What would Filipino business education look like if we took our own wisdom traditions that seriously? Third, we need to root ourselves more deeply in Philippine social realities. Business education becomes a force for good when business schools become genuine partners in addressing the specific challenges facing Philippine society. RVRCOB’s 4 Palmes recognition tells us that Philippine business schools are worth recognizing globally. IIM Indore shows us one possibility: a business school that draws strength from its cultural context while meeting global standards. Our international peers are calling for us. The global picture needs the colors only we Filipinos can add. – Rappler.com Patrick Adriel H.

"​​I digress from my usual programming to write about a recent vacation to Taipei. The last time I was there was in 2014, and I was eager to see how things had changed more than a decade later, especially with the specter of China hanging over everyone’s heads. I’m happy to report that things are perfectly normal there — for now. The dumplings, hotpot, and large hunks of chicken are as delicious as ever. The boba milk tea is still as sweet. And the stinky tofu is, well, still as stinky. The night markets are bustling with people: there was barely anything to stand on. (READ: From night markets to nature: The vacationer’s guide to Taipei 2023) We went there on the weekend when Typhoon Opong hit the Philippines, and the weather in Taipei was quite hot. At one point, there was, in fact, too much sun. This forced us to go around on Uber rides, which was cool and, well, uber-convenient. Near sundown one day, we climbed Elephant Mountain, which offered a lovely view of the city. We did the same back in 2014, when we had much more limber bodies. This time around, the climb took more of a toll on our bodies. It was a reminder that maybe we (I) should be working out more. An even more breathtaking view of the city can be seen at the topmost floor of Taipei 101, which was the world’s tallest building for some time, beaten only by Burj Khalifa in 2010. We rode the elevator, which scaled 89 floors in just 37 seconds flat, and I’m glad it’s still the world’s fastest. We saw again the damper, the colossal steel ball in the middle of Taipei 101, which stabilized the entire structure. In May 2019, Taiwan became the first Asian country to legalize same-sex marriage. My boyfriend and I stood and took a picture at a rainbow-painted street in Ximending District, but admittedly the LGBT vibes are not as out there as in Bangkok, where same-sex marriage has also been legalized. All in all, it was amazing to see how normal life was in Taipei. It’s business as usual, at least on the surface. (READ: 10 family-friendly things to do in Taiwan) Yet, there were tell-tale signs of how much things have changed amid China’s increasing threats of conquering Taiwan. For example, along the streets, you’d often see small posters pointing to “Air Defense Shelters.” People already know where to go in case the worse happens. People have also been training in first aid, conducting drills on how to evacuate. Said one BBC report, “In downtown Taipei, emergency teams and volunteers practiced evacuating injured people, putting out fires, and lowering themselves down buildings which had been dressed up to look as if they had been hit by missiles. Medical teams triaged evacuees in a car park, wrapping up wounds and stringing up bags of saline for IV drips under tents.” I don’t want to imagine how much destruction will happen in this otherwise peaceful country, with its otherwise peaceable people. But if and when war breaks out, the world’s attention will zero in on this small country, and I’m afraid that life will never be the same again there. One of the sectors most at risk is Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. This country alone produces nearly all of the world’s most sophisticated semiconductors, used in all sorts of products like smartphones, laptops, wearables, smart appliances, engines, servers, robots, military communications systems, satellites, quantum computers, etc. Among Taiwanese firms, TSMC, or the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, is the most prominent and vital. China wants to control Taiwan’s semiconductor industry to boost its own economy and military, and in the process also weaken the influence of the already embattled US economy. But at the same time, China also can’t risk destroying this sector when war pushes through. Such an event will cripple not just China but also the rest of the world. And the last thing China wants is to antagonize the rest of the world and lose allies left and right. At any rate, China’s rhetoric continues to suggest that they’re gearing up to invade Taiwan. Recently, China insisted that a past UN resolution can be used as legal basis for invading Taiwan. But Taiwan denounced this and said it’s plain and simple disinformation. The thing is, even the US seems to be trying to get a piece of the pie that is the semiconductor industry. A US representative recently floated the idea of a 50-50 production scheme between the US and Taiwan. Allegedly, this is because of the US desire to secure semiconductor production in case the China-Taiwan war begins. Under Trump, the US government is also actively pushing for the “reshoring” of tech manufacturing within US borders. Understandably, Taiwan is likewise pushing back against the US on this. Before this, Trump imposed a 20% tariff on imports coming from Taiwan. All this puts into question to what extent the US is a true friend to Taiwan, especially once push comes to shove. Despite being so much richer than us (their per-person income is over seven times ours), Taiwan and the Philippines today face many of the same problems. We both find ourselves trapped between two warring global powers (the US and China), we both face trade attacks from the US (the Philippine tariff is not too far at 19%), and we both face the prospect of Chinese invasion (but obviously Taiwan is so much more at risk, because the risk of invasion is nationwide). A few months ago, I had watched a number of war games that provide hints at various scenarios that could happen if a Chinese invasion of Taiwan happens. I’m not an expert on it, but all the scenarios looked grim to me. The likelihood of the Philippines being roped in is quite high, not least because we’re so very near Taiwan. The old joke is that when you’re in Batanes province, there’s a chance you can hear the rooster crowing in Taiwan. But seriously, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. himself said on record we will inevitably be pulled into war if and when China decides to attack Taiwan. I can only hope that the worst doesn’t happen. At any rate, I was stumped at how calmly the Taiwanese are going on with their lives. Their bravery and solidarity should be an inspiration to all Filipinos. Somehow, just like Taipei 101, Taiwan seems to have its own society-wide damper that keeps their people steady amid shocks rocking their nation. The Philippines needs to find that stabilizing force, too. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of False Nostalgia: The Marcos “Golden Age” Myths and How to Debunk Them.

"MANILA, Philippines – Is sustainable, fair, and clean food for all even possible for the Philippines? The question has been circling the minds and hearts of chefs, farmers, entrepreneurs, small and medium enterprise (SME) owners, advocates, and nongovernment organizations for years — and it has only grown louder and more urgent. Rising inflation has been hitting households just as hard as our farmers, who struggle for a steady income. Climate change brings floods and typhoons, and consumers are more conscious about health and where their food is coming from. The stakes are high. But the spirit of the Filipino community soars higher. From November 18 to 23, Bacolod City — the emerging slow food capital of the Philippines — offered a vivid, hopeful answer. For five days, the City of Smiles became a beacon of light for both consumer and producer, and a delicious avenue of storytelling through food and delicacies from all over the archipelago. This was Bacolod’s first Terra Madre Asia Pacific Festival — the biggest sustainable gastronomy event in APAC and the first Terra Madre held outside Turin, Italy. The essence of slow food was the binding agent of everything that transpired over those five days. It was a glimpse of what the future could look like. For five days, General Lacson Street and the Capitol Lagoon Park transformed into a bustling hub of flavors: budbud salt from Miagao from a bamboo stalk; tanigue kinilaw chopped fresh with Sagay vinegar; charcoal-grilled eel from Bago City; woven baskets of coffee and cacao from Mindanao; organic produce from Negros farmers; and trays of diwal (razor clams) steaming in butter and garlic. Chefs, farmers, artisans, tourists, and locals converged across the lagoon, running to Taste Workshops, lining up for cooking demos, and listening to insights and tips from regional culinary figures alongside Filipino chefs from Manila’s Michelin-starred restaurants. Slow Food rejects the very grain of fast food. Simply put, slow food is the right to good, clean, and fair food for all. It’s about transparency: who made it, where it was grown, how it was harvested, and what’s in it. Slow Food Negros advocates get to know farmers on the island and put them on a pedestal; farmers are the real stars here. The movement becomes a platform for farmers to showcase the fruits of their labor and then become leaders in their own communities. To the Terra Madre team and its thousands of attendees, the event was a success: sold-out booths, a greater awareness and appreciation of what the Philippines has to offer, and agri-entrepreneurs and SMEs connecting with chefs, local governments, and other businesses. The communal energy was palpable, and the pride was evident. But one event is not enough to sustain the mission. At the end of the festivities, what’s next? How do we move this forward? How do we ensure a fair, sustainable, and clean gastronomy for all? First, it’s about understanding — and never forgetting — where we came from. During Terra Madre, Erwan Heussaff emphasized the importance of keeping our traditions alive through online education. The modern-day food storyteller, content creator, and founder of FEATR creates short and long films that spotlight regional produce from across the Philippines. He won the 2023 James Beard Media Award for social media, a milestone that helped put global attention on Filipino food. “We come from a particular past, and moving to the Philippines is a way to understand our story better — where we came from, how the food shaped our identity, and how our identity shaped the food that we eat,” he said. FEATR zooms in on heirloom ingredients, people, and heritage recipes that are at risk of being forgotten — and with them, parts of our identity. Heussaff said it was affecting farm biodiversity, so FEATR took on the urgent responsibility to communicate this through video, the medium he believes is the best to reach the latest generation. “Education is a great equalizer,” he said. The internet becomes a portal to tell stories. Through his videos, he creates a “marketing flywheel”: tell the story, build awareness, and organically bring in demand. We see it on TikTok and Instagram: a viral review or reel makes a restaurant or product the next must-try. Why not use the same energy for local produce? Heussaff said restaurant owners, chefs, and entrepreneurs play the role of communicators — talking about stories, building traction for artisans, and, while doing so, forcing the hand to provide better logistics and cleaner access so food can circulate better around the country and the world. Johanne Siy, the Dagupan-born chef who helms Lolla in Singapore, was named Asia’s Best Female Chef (2023) by the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants Academy. Her cuisine is produce-driven and mindful of the culinary traditions she grew up with — a mix of European fine dining and Mediterranean influences. Based in Singapore for 20 years, she said living between contexts opened her eyes. Singapore imports 90% of its food, and the Philippines is actually very lucky to be reliant on agriculture for food security. “I’m in a position to magnify the voices of the local heroes here and introduce that part of our culture to the rest of the world,” she said. Michelin-starred Toyo Eatery’s Chef Jordy Navarra has won the Gin Mare Art of Hospitality Award (2025) and the Flor de Caña Sustainable Restaurant Award (2023). According to Asia’s 50 Best, Toyo “prioritizes Filipino produce and people, fostering long-term relationships with local farmers and artisans.” The academy noted that while many equate sustainability with the environment alone, Toyo prioritizes the sustainability of people and cultural heritage. For Navarra, traveling made him more aware of what he wanted to do for Toyo: “Traveling the world, trying to learn from different cultures, basically focused on learning how to cook in the technical aspect. While on that journey, I realized this isn’t the food I need — it’s the food I grew up eating.” Dining isn’t about the fanfare, the Instagram hits, the upscale ambiance, or the prices. It all boils down to the ingredients. “The more you learn how to cook, the more you realize you’re basically a prisoner to whatever product you have,” he said. Sourcing locally isn’t always easy, with logistical issues and inconsistent supply chains. “But the cool part after that is learning and discovering more through the years,” Navarra said. It has been a humbling journey for him as a chef so far. “What I learned is I can’t dictate to the producer the specs of how I want to cook, but I should accept what the world gives us,” he said. “Accept the best of what the world can give us. As chefs, we try and use that and represent that in the best way we can.” “Now, we are very proud of the industry that we have,” he added. “The majority of restaurants have some form of Philippine-based or locally based approach. Our whole scene came from trying to work with the product we have and adjust our approach.” But challenges remain. Heussaff described the basic struggle: finding a farmer’s contact, discovering whether they even have signal, relying on Facebook Messenger, booking a bus, and going two hours north of Manila to pick up produce. Many low-income and rural communities lack reliable Internet access. But community is the best ingredient. Navarra built a team dedicated to foraging and procurement — “an army of people” — to take on the journey of sourcing. “It’s getting better because one trip can help five restaurants,” he said. Chefs share the product, restaurants come together. Siy stressed the importance of building relationships, too: farmers must “feel good” about their work. “I can just reach out to anyone I see and build a personal relationship with that farmer. Then I enrolled him in the cycle of the restaurant, so that we work together to achieve menu planning and supply scheduling,” Siy said. It’s a win-win for everyone involved. We must convince farmers that what they grow is special — that it’s not a commodity, Heussaff said. It leads to investment, better infrastructure, cleaner processes, and wider access. “We want them to know it’s highly prized and highly looked for. And once you’re able to build that interest and prove that interest to that certain community, then you start community building,” he added. It’s a chain reaction; when everyone around that community starts believing in that product, more time and skills are invested [in] making it. It’s not so much about the revenue but about empowering these farmers and artisans to take pride in what they create. Bringing Philippine pride abroad matters more than we think. Heussaff once saw asin tultul from Guimaras displayed in a Seoul beef restaurant. “The chef didn’t know me. I didn’t know the chef. I asked where he got that. He goes, ‘Chef Jordy brought it to me.’ They proudly display it and still use it in tasting courses,” he shared. Soft marketing drives interest not only back home but also overseas. The conversation must not end here. Talking about it, asking the right questions, and starting the right discussions are the embers to keep the slow food fire alive. “That’s maybe one of the nice things about social media,” Navarra said. Educational exchanges and events like Terra Madre are also a pivotal step forward in boosting attraction from domestic and international tourists. Politics plays a role, too. Heussaff explained how making heritage products “sexy” can generate PR pressure that leads to policy change — the artisanal salt asin tibuok in Bohol became part of a tourism circuit and fed into legal amendments. “You need to give them a really strong story,” he said about our politicians. When the story is attractive enough, they listen. But we don’t need to wait for the law to make a change, Heussaff said. To change the system, we must first change ourselves. If we rely on the system, we may end up waiting a while. “Our role as influencers is to create as much noise as possible, hoping that someone is listening and someone is willing to take that for them,” he said. The same goes for us consumers: we can do our part at home by using social media as a tool. If you see good, clean, and fair food in your community, share it. “We all have that responsibility to make sure somebody knows,” Navarra said. One post can lead a huge audience to discover something local and unique. We must remember that food isn’t just food. According to Heussaff, it can be seen as “very simplified fuel” that we need as humans, but it plays such an important part in the representation of our culture and country. “We’re still very much kind of scratching…the surface of what Filipino biodiversity is and what we actually have to showcase,” Heussaff said — a reality that is fueling the passion of the country’s slow food community, chefs, and supporters. To truly uplift our farmers, we must first cherish what is already ours. There is no reason to look outward, the three chefs echoed; we are abundant in resources and rich in flavors, traditions, and stories from every corner of the country. And in time — through community work, social media, online advocates, and grassroots events like Terra Madre — slow food will grow beyond a movement.

"LA UNION, Philippines – Inside the new SM City La Union, the noise of modern life never stops. The music blares from speakers of different stores, each trying to outdo the other and pull passersby inside; the chatter of thousands of mall-goers fills the air; the shrieks of children echo as they run past food kiosks; and the familiar piped in jingle: “Here at Essss Emmmm, we’ve got it all for you!” But turn a corner, and you’ll find a store that seems to breathe at a slower rhythm. Inside Arkus Balay, the light bends differently. It slips through the weave of bamboo pendant lamps, the kind you might see in an upscale resort in Thailand, in a magazine spread of a resthouse in Tagaytay, or in a café that mixes modern design with local texture. Each handcrafted piece looks alive: rattan-crocheted pottery wrapped in lattice, wall trays patterned like woven constellations, towering teardrop vases that stretch up to six feet tall, and traditional diamond-and-cross patterns woven into a bolero made of inabel fabric. Each one shows the marks of the hands that shaped it. Amid this forest of craftsmanship stands Mandrake Palabay, one-half of the daring couple behind the brand. He points to the ceiling, a canopy of lamps: spherical, conical, some fringed like sea grass. “That’s the u-ong lamp,” he said, referring to the mushroom-shaped ceiling lamps. “The weaver moves around the piece, not the other way around.” It’s among his favorite innovations. It’s a design that taught his weavers to think differently, to follow the rhythm of their hands instead of forcing the form. Unlike most designers, he has never studied design. Yet the space he built inside this mall feels like a pause button — a place where craftsmanship slows down what the world keeps speeding up. Mandrake grew up in San Fernando City in La Union, in a family where principles came before comfort. His father, Crisanto Palabay, was an activist tortured during the Marcos dictatorship. His uncles Romulo and Armando were killed for their activism. Their names are on the Bantayog ng mga Bayani, listed among those who stood up to power. “Their courage was on another level,” Mandrake says. “I’m just persistent.” A post shared by 11,103 (@11103.film) Where his father and uncles fought through speeches and marches, Mandrake would fight through craft and continuity. Heritage, too, must be defended, he believes. His father had three rules: never steal, never cheat, never complain about work. “Even when you retire,” his father told him, “you’ll still wash your own dishes, do the laundry, clean the house.” To his activist father, work was not a burden, but a way of life. So when Mandrake, a computer science graduate, left for Hong Kong in his twenties to work as a domestic helper, he carried that lesson with him. He called this season his stepping stone, a way to test opportunities and see what he could learn. His employer tagged him along during a visit to a businessman friend’s showroom. Bored while waiting, Mandrake roamed the vast retail space for artificial flowers and home accents. He started fixing displays. The businessman noticed. A year after, when Mandrake was back in the Philippines, the showroom owner in Hong Kong called with a job offer: Complete a product catalogue that buyers all over the world can refer to. Mandrake didn’t know a thing about design, photography, catalogue-making. He said yes anyway. He remembered what his Uncle Peter, a Swiss man married to his aunt, once told him: “To do a job properly, you need the right tools. You can’t tighten a screw with a knife or scissors.” The newly minted catalogue maker asked for a good camera. “If the pictures were bad, I’d have no excuse.” That habit of saying yes to new work and arming himself with the tools became his way forward. It’s how he learned, advanced, and reinvented himself. Mandrake worked for that Hong Kong-based boss for ten years. The company factories in Sri Lanka , Hong Kong, and Myanmar produced handwoven home products for exports. He learned about proportion and balance while arranging displays. He learned to sell through photographs and catalogues. Later, he joined the design department. “I usually start with the material,” he says. “Can it bend? Twist? Fold? Once I know that, I imagine what it can become: baskets, trays, containers. Then I draw, measure, and sit down with a weaver to make the first sample.” He was exposed to other designs when they joined international trade fairs. His wife Jackie later joined him, handling costing and logistics, checking if sourcing and producing the products made business sense. If it’s an artificial flower, Jackie checked the cost of each petal, stick, leaf. “That’s where I learned to balance creativity with practicality,” Mandrake says. A work mentor once told him: “If you do a job, do it correctly the first time.” Mandrake took that to heart. “That means studying before you start,” he says. “Learn from others’ mistakes so you don’t waste time or materials.” After a decade of working in factories in Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, he moved to a lighting company in Myanmar. “Chandeliers made of crystals,” he says, laughing. “I didn’t know lighting, but I said yes again.” This new work tested him. “Some designs looked good on paper, then bad in real life,” he says. “Some never went into production.” When the pandemic hit, factories closed, orders stopped, and his salary was cut in half. After 18 years abroad, Mandrake returned to La Union for good. Mandrake and Jackie asked a simple question to guide their next move: What do we know how to do, and who can we do it with? They joined trade fairs, learned about the state of rattan bamboo, and local fabric supplies, as well as the skillsets of local weavers. The old weavers were still at their looms, but they were stuck making the same baskets, blankets, mirrors, and trays that filled souvenir stalls for decades. “They had no product developers,” Mandrake says. “No one to push them to try something new.” The craft celebrated in other countries is tired and dying here. So he started visiting them in the towns of Bangar, Bacnotan, and the quieter barangays in the hills of Abra, Ilocos, and other areas his late uncles had roamed in the 1970s and stayed in while fighting an oppressive government. He showed the weavers his sketches. They hesitated. The new shapes looked odd, the designs unfamiliar. Mandrake understood their fear. Change, in small towns, often feels like betrayal. So he found another way to persuade them: he paid them more. He told them he already had orders, even when he didn’t. He ordered sample after sample, storing them in his own warehouse, just to keep the faith alive. “It was hard,” he says. “But I wanted to prove we could make something different.” In 2022, he opened the first Arkus Balay showroom and outlet in San Fernando, along the highway where tourists from surf town San Juan and other northern travel spots pass as they drive back to Manila. He went full blast on social media, gathering interest and orders from buyers from Ilocos all the way to Tagaytay. Back in the weaving communities, he showed them photos of pendant lamps hanging on hotel lounges, hand-braided baskets used as accents in a posh living rooms. “It changed the energy. It gave them pride,” he beams. “Now they’re the ones asking for new designs.” Not everything sold. “Sometimes you make something and no one wants it,” he says. “Then a few months later, everyone is looking for it. You just have to keep creating.” He laughs. “People don’t always know what they want until they see it.” “La Union craft still lacks exposure,” he adds. “Only now are we starting to gain traction through exhibits and government programs. Before, other places took credit for our work. Even the brooms sold in Baguio, many are made here in La Union.” He doesn’t say this with bitterness, only resolve. “We want to capture the higher market so we can pay the weavers what they deserve,” he adds. “So we focus on quality and design. That’s how we set ourselves apart.” It is, in its own way, activism through craft. A campaign to restore dignity to handmade work and make communities believe again in what their hands can create. “If this craft dies,” he says, “the communities lose their identity.” Before SM City La Union opened its glass doors, Mandrake and Jackie weren’t sure they wanted to be part of it. They already have a thriving roadside studio shop. In the mall, everything would be brighter, faster, noisier. “It was a difficult decision,” Mandrake says. “We knew it would be exposure, but also a big risk.” They initially said no. The numbers didn’t add up. Rent was steep, and SM also took a share of their sales. Not long after, SM called again with a better offer. Once more, Mandrake and Jackie faced the choice between comfort and courage. They said yes. “We put almost all our savings here,” he says. “That’s how we are. Either go full blast, or don’t do it at all.” Two weeks after opening, “sales have been good,” he says, encouraged. Some days, he still doubts. “If it doesn’t work, it’s ok. We’ve failed before.” But the moments when people ask about the lamps or the baskets keep him going. “Those small conversations make me think it’s worth it,” he says. “You realize you’re not just selling things to buyers. You’re reminding the weavers where they came from.” At 50 square meters, the SM branch is small compared to their showroom outside, but it represented something larger. This is a test of whether authenticity could survive commercial speed. Their neighbors are national and global: UNIQLO, Mannam, Philip Stein, Kultura, Toy Kingdom, Miniso, and more. To Mandrake, Arkus Balay’ advantage was something no brand could replicate: proximity to the maker. “We deal directly with the communities. We know the weaver. We know the story.” For him, the mall wasn’t just a business move. It was an experiment in visibility, a statement that La Union’s handmade heritage deserved the same spotlight as imported goods. “If you don’t try,” he says, “you’ll never know.” At 48, Mandrake no longer dreams of becoming a global brand. What he wants is continuity: that the next generation of La Union weavers will still know the rhythm of their hands. Inside Arkus Balay, that rhythm is visible everywhere: in the weaved fabric, bamboo, or rattan that tightens and loosens like breath, in the trays stacked like ripples, in the pendant lamps that throw soft light across the walls. Each piece carries persistence and trial, the proof that beauty can come from things that almost failed. It’s a store that feels like a home that remembers where it came from. When asked what he learned from years abroad, he says, “There’s no such thing as luck. You have to study, research, know your market and your price. Most of all, listen to your customers. Timing and opportunity come rarely, but when they do, you have to be ready.” He looks around the store. “What I learned from my family is to stand for something.” In a mall filled with chain stores and glass displays, Arkus Balay feels like a small resistance: one built not on slogans, but on craftsmanship. Mandrake calls it “making things that are sustainable, natural, ethical, local.” But really, he’s been building something else all along: a living argument that conviction can be inherited, and beauty can be its expression. – Rappler.com",True,true,Arkus Balay: The craft of conviction,https://www.rappler.com/business/inside-arkus-balay-handicraft-store-sm-city-la-union/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — Filipino chocolate takes the global stage, as Davao-born chocolatier Malagos Chocolate and award-winning, bean-to-bar brand Auro Chocolate are named among the 100 Best Chocolates in the World by international food database Taste Atlas. Malagos’ 85% Dark Chocolate and Auro’s 42% Milk Hojicha placed 19th and 71st, respectively, on the online travel guide’s list, with both chocolates gaining a 5-star rating. America’s Amano Chocolate topped this year’s ranking, with its Raspberry Rose variant impressing critics for its “rich taste of premium dark chocolate with the bright and fruity flavors of raspberries, complemented by delicate floral notes of rose.” According to the international food guide, Auro’s 42% Milk Hojicha bar is a “sophisticated blend that combines the rich flavors of roasted green tea (Hojicha) with creamy milk chocolate,” giving credit to Auro for making chocolate sustainable. The tea-infused chocolate bar won gold in the “Milk chocolate bars with an infusion or flavoring” category, with a vote turnout of 92.2%, during the 2023 International Chocolate Awards. As for the 85% Dark Chocolate bar of Malagos Chocolate, Taste Atlas deems it “distinctly rich and robust” for its high cacao content.

"MANILA, Philippines – Ayala Land Incorporated (ALI) is pushing to turn Laguna into the country’s next commercial business district (CBD). ALI is developing Metro Nuvali, a 200-hectare mixed-use development in Laguna. The upcoming CBD will be divided into three parts — with dedicated zones for shopping and leisure, commercial and cultural centres, and a civic complex that includes a satellite city hall — nestled in its 2,500-hectare estate. “We’re seeing entrepreneurs, we’re seeing professionals coming in, BPOs (business process outsourcing firms) continue to be interested. International schools are interested. They’re looking at opportunities to grow further down the south,” said Christopher Maglanoc, senior vice president (SVP) and group head of Ayala Land Estates. The shift in focus comes as reservation sales from Ayala Land’s core revenue driver — its premium segment composed of Ayala Land Premier and Alveo — posted a year-on-year decline. Based on ALI’s latest financial report, premium brands booked P20.3 billion in the third quarter of 2025, down 6.1% from the P21.6 billion in the same period in 2024. Ayala Land is now taking advantage of Nuvali’s growing community and the development of new infrastructure projects connecting Metro Manila to nearby provinces. “It’s a natural progression,” Maglanoc said. “We’re just capitalising on that.” Metro Nuvali’s three districts — Lakeside, Central, and Civic — will all be accessible via major roads and will be interconnected through parks, walkways, and a shuttle system serving the area. The first 70 hectares of the CBD may be what the public is familiar with, thanks to Ayala Malls Solenad. This forms part of the Lakeside District, which accounts for half or 100 hectares of Metro Nuvali. “We’re just building on it and enhancing it,” said May Rodriguez, vice president and senior estate development head of Ayala Land. The mall, which has since been renamed to Ayala Malls Nuvali, is getting an additional 50,000 square meters of leasable commercial space. It will house a total of 550 stores — among those expected to open by the second half of 2026 are Beyond the Box, Sketchers, Nike Rise, Wilson, The Matcha Tokyo, Sports Direct, and Foot Locker. It will soon have a two-storey food hall and new parking slots. This is all part of Ayala Land’s mall refresh, which the property giant has allocated around P17.5 billion for. Meanwhile, 60 hectares of Metro Nuvali will be allocated to its Civic District. This is where the 2-hectare Santa Rosa Civic Complex, a donation to the local government, will rise. This means that the CBD will house a satellite city hall, its own convention center, hotel, and command center. The Central District, spanning 40 hectares, will be allocated for office towers and workspaces. According to ALI officials, the company has already started selling commercial land within the project. “There are certain areas that we’re keeping for our own use, whether that be for the mall, for the hotels,” Maglanoc said. “We’ve identified all of these strategic locations.” Ayala Land did not provide a timeline for when Metro Nuvali will be completed. But the Civic District is a priority, with hopes to break ground on the Civic Complex by 2026 with the help of the local government of Santa Rosa. In 2024, Calabarzon contributed 14.7% to the country’s economy, ranking just second to Metro Manila. The region’s economy was valued at P3.27 trillion, thanks to industries such as manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and real estate. Ayala Land officials have noted how the Cavite-Laguna Expressway — the toll road linked to the South Luzon Expressway — helped Nuvali thrive to what it is today. Nuvali is also accessible to commuters, thanks to a point-to-point bus from One Ayala in Makati that also services travel to and from the eco-city on weekdays. And with the construction of the North-South Commuter Railway, which includes a stop at Santa Rosa, commuters will have more options in the future. However, ALI officials are hoping that with the development of Metro Nuvali, those in the area would no longer need to travel far for opportunities. “There’s a big build-up community in the South, so it’s natural for them to be able to say, ‘Why not put up my next business, the next office here in this area? Because this is where I live,” said Maglanoc. “The ideal situation is for them to have their business already here.” – Rappler.com",True,true,"Ayala Land bullish on expansion beyond metro, doubles down on Nuvali",https://www.rappler.com/business/ayala-land-bullish-expansion-metro-nuvali/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – J.K. Rowling on Monday, September 29, responded to the statements made by actress Emma Watson regarding the Harry Potter author’s views on the transgender community. Watson appeared on the Jay Shetty Podcast on September 25 after years of not appearing in feature films and in TV shows. Her last movie appearance was in the 2019 adaptation of Little Women directed by Greta Gerwig. It starred an ensemble cast of Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, Laura Dern, and Timothée Chalamet. Watson expressed that while she doesn’t agree with Rowling’s opinions on the transgender community, it doesn’t necessarily mean she doesn’t appreciate the memories they’ve shared together over the years. “I really don’t believe that having had that experience and holding the love and support and views that I have, [means] that I can’t and don’t treasure Jo and the person that I had personal experiences with,” Watson said in the podcast. “I will never believe that one negates the other and that my experience of that person, I don’t get to keep and cherish. I think it’s my deepest wish that I hope people who don’t agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don’t necessarily share the same opinion with.” Rowling, who has expressed her sentiments towards the community publicly since June 2020, stood up for herself after reposting a clip from GB News. In December 2019, she publicly supported Maya Forstater, a British ex-think tank employee who filed a lawsuit against the UK government for allowing residents to select their gender in identification documents. This support caused backlash on the author’s end, causing many critics and LGBTQIA+ activists to deem her a TERF, a trans-exclusionary radical feminist. According to CNN, the term is used “to describe self-proclaimed feminists who try to police the boundaries of womanhood by excluding trans women from the category.” Known for being vocal about her views on social media, she targets Watson, who played Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter film series, and Daniel Radcliffe, who played the titular role, for speaking against her for her views on trans people in a statement posted on X. “Emma and Dan in particular have both made it clear over the last few years that they think our former professional association gives them a particular right — nay, obligation — to critique me and my views in public,” Rowling wrote. “Years after they finished acting in Potter, they continue to assume the role of de facto spokespeople for the world I created.” I'm seeing quite a bit of comment about this, so I want to make a couple of points.I'm not owed eternal agreement from any actor who once played a character I created. The idea is as ludicrous as me checking with the boss I had when I was twenty-one for what opinions I should… https://t.co/c0pz19P7jc Both Watson and Radcliffe have publicly defended the trans community in their own ways, taking to social media and press interviews about their thoughts on Rowling’s controversial perspective. It’s not just two-thirds of the original Golden Trio at the forefront of allyship towards the trans community. Fantastic Beasts trilogy actor Eddie Redmayne backs them on this, saying in a 2020 interview that “respect for transgender people remains a cultural imperative, and over the years I have been trying to constantly educate myself.” “I disagree with Jo’s comments. Trans women are women, trans men are men and non-binary identities are valid,” Redmayne said of Rowling in a 2020 Variety interview. “I would never want to speak on behalf of the community but I do know that my dear transgender friends and colleagues are tired of this constant questioning of their identities, which all too often results in violence and abuse. They simply want to live their lives peacefully, and it’s time to let them do so.” Rowling is an English author known for her Harry Potter book series. The books were adapted into eight feature films headed by Radcliffe, Watson, and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. According to Box Office Mojo, all eight films made $250 to $380 million in lifetime gross. – Juliana Chloe Gonzales/Rappler.com Juliana Chloe Gonzales is a Rappler intern studying AB Communication Arts at De La Salle University.",True,true,J.K.

"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Tesla CEO Elon Musk scored a resounding victory on Thursday, November 6, as shareholders approved a pay package of as much as $878 billion over the next decade, endorsing his vision of morphing the EV maker into an AI and robotics juggernaut. The vote, analysts have said, is a positive for Tesla’s stock, whose valuation hangs on Musk’s vision of making vehicles drive themselves, expanding robotaxis across the US and selling humanoid robots, even though his far-right political rhetoric has hurt the Tesla brand this year. A win for Musk was widely expected as the billionaire was allowed to exercise the full voting rights of his roughly 15% stake after the automaker moved to Texas from Delaware, where a legal challenge has held up a previous pay rise. The approval comes even after opposition from some major investors, including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund. Tesla’s board had said Musk could quit if the pay package was not approved. The vote will also allay investor concern that Musk’s focus has been diluted with his work in politics as well as in running his other companies, including rocket maker SpaceX and artificial intelligence startup xAI. The board and many investors who lent their endorsement have said the nearly $1 trillion package benefits shareholders in the longer run as Musk must ensure Tesla achieves a series of milestones to get paid. Goals for Musk over the next decade include the company’s delivering 20 million vehicles, having 1 million robotaxis in operation, selling 1 million robots, and earning as much as $400 billion in core profit. But in order for him to get paid, Tesla’s stock value has to rise in tandem, first to $2 trillion from the current $1.5 trillion, and all the way to $8.5 trillion. Under the new plan, Musk could earn as much as $878 billion in Tesla stock over 10 years. Musk would be given as much as $1 trillion in stock but would have to make some payments back to Tesla. – Rappler.com",True,true,Tesla shareholders approve $878-billion pay plan for Elon Musk,https://www.rappler.com/technology/tesla-shareholders-approve-elon-musk-pay-plan/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — It’s often hard to see beauty in a city with tangled power lines, flooded potholes, and cramped sidewalks. However, the daily struggle of leaving one’s home for school or work, and wading through the jungle of jumbled streets can sometimes feel more manageable with a quick escape from such moments of survival. Even with just a glimpse of a witty graffiti or a hopeful town mural — a city, no matter how gray it has become, can still celebrate the life and vibrance of its passersby, reminding that being Filipino is one thing that can never run out of color. And this celebration is at the heart of Bonifacio Global City (BGC) in Taguig, where art and creativity leap out from the corners of galleries and live through the streets you only need to pass by to see. Beginning in the early 2010s through the ArtBGC Festival by the Bonifacio Art Foundation Inc. (BAFI), this public art movement has been inviting local and international muralists to bring color into the city — turning its blank walls into living canvases. So before you step outside, here’s a quick tour guide of eight striking BGC murals you might want to visit for free. Greener St. says everything you need to know from its name. This cool-toned, mint-green mural shows people on the move — whether it’s through cycling, rollerblading, scootering, or skateboarding — inviting people to trade their cell phones for a walk or a ride, even for just a short while. What’s particularly interesting about this mural is how the floor defies gravity: instead of a realistic flat ground, the striped road rounds into a semi-circle. Other than visually complementing the bright orange sun at the center and the rhythmic pattern of the wheels, this subtle distortion also signifies the power of what one’s body can do — only if it thrived within a city designed for its movement. Before your meal reaches the table, it passes through the heart and the hands of unsung heroes. Against a black background strewn with silhouettes of palay (unhusked rice), this mural spotlights the farmer — the face behind every Filipino’s source of health, strength, and everyday energy. The farmer, whose head merges with a carabao, symbolizes the noble strength and arduous work behind the journey of rice — from the wrinkled hand holding palay to the open palm carrying grains. As the farmer places his salakot (straw hat) over his chest, as one would when singing the National Anthem, the mural emblazons the Filipino’s unyielding pride and passion for oneself and for one’s nation. When walking in the street, people rarely say tabi tabi po (excuse me) anymore, but this mural cleverly positions a sleeping nuno sa punso (old spirit inside a mound) at the heart of BGC — preserving the life of Filipino mythology within a place that often forgets about it. While the thought of stepping on a mystical anthill evokes the fear of angering a nuno (and getting cursed in return), this traditional idea also stems from how our ancestors deeply respected being in harmony with nature. In a postcolonial world, where cities look homogeneous and there’s little proof of our diverse, cultural history — this mural proudly reclaims space for Filipino identity. Among Frizzell’s series of We are What We Pretend to Be murals, this one depicts how a child balances a world of imagination and creativity with reality. A young boy spray paints a childish caricature of a tiger (with a head and a body), while a realistic image of a tiger (only with a head) hovers in front of his face, symbolizing how his movement from childhood to adulthood enforces a kind of pressure to put on a “mask” to belong to society. Yet while this “tiger” mask helps him move forward, it remains only a fragment of the whole — a reminder that a child never fully lets go of the past, as it’s a remnant of a distant reality where the only thing that mattered was expressing oneself without judgment. As one grows up, one learns to adapt and move on, with the past still following behind. If you’ve walked past this corner of BGC, it’s hard not to be hypnotized by this neo-graffiti mural. In a surreal, futuristic backdrop, an animal’s antlers pop out of the cracked wall as abstract shapes hang in the air — checkered patches, twisting roots, floating orbs, and ocean waves that seem to collide from different realities. Based on the title, this mural suggests the Filipino folktale trickster, “Pilandok” — a clever creature who outsmarts the powerful to survive. That same spirit is embodied here as the animal leaps out from the wall, showing self-expression can still break free even within the city’s restraints. At a time when breathing clean air feels like a privilege, it’s often hard to remember the living ecosystem within. But through this mural, passersby can take a moment to pause and breathe, and remember their inseparable connection with nature. This mural centers on a human ribcage intertwined with blooming plants and harmonious animals — a hopeful, vivid contrast with the reality of how buildings often feel enclosing for the ones who keep it running. As the ribcage opens, it reminds how the very bodies people live in shouldn’t feel restricting, but liberating. At the end of the day, while the world outside may not always look its best, it’s what’s inside — in one’s purpose and outlook — that makes the difference. If you’ve strolled around BGC’s streets, you’ve most likely spotted some fluffy cats snoozing or “loafing” on the corners. But if not, you’ll see a few on this adorable mural — one that turns an ordinary pipe outlet into a lilac oven filled with cat loaves freshly baked right in front of you. Two chef cats man the oven and roll with paws, as slices of bread with sleepy faces rise beside them. The brass knobs above even look like oversized dials, completing the illusion! This mural cracks the city’s concrete and plants nature within, immortalizing some of the Philippines’ endangered species, such as the tamaraw, the Philippine eagle, and the Palawan peacock-pheasant. Across the wall are gigantic human footprints that represent an interesting duality: the big impact that our marks leave on the environment, and how small we often perceive ourselves as part of it. Every step on this mural symbolizes how our actions shape the reality that future generations of Filipinos will experience. Yet, at the same time, it also portrays the feeling of being human — of being intimidated or overwhelmed by the idea of a big action, especially when there is more individual pressure than systemic change for a liveable environment. When walls are treated not as boundaries, but as spaces of conversation — that’s when survival in the city can feel less draining or isolating, but something more: one that has the power to remind even the busiest people of how art can string in one piece their shared realities, and help weave in new perspectives. And what makes these murals special is not only how they bridge both realms of imagination and reality, but in how they also design public space in a way that severs a price tag on art, making its appreciation more accessible for many. In the end, isn’t that what a city should be — making space for connection and creativity, and reminding people that they belong here? Not just people shaping the city, but a city designed for them. – Jaella Magno/Rappler.com Jaella Magno is a Rappler intern studying AB Literature major in Creative Writing at De La Salle University.",True,true,8 must-see murals in BGC — and what they mean,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/bonifacio-global-city-must-see-murals-meaning/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Do a regular Google search on AI technologies and their environmental impact. To say the least, the results are worrisome. Now, do a similar query on ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or other chatbots. You would have gotten a similar set of answers — only this time, you’ve used at least five times more power than a regular search. In June, a United Nations report found that four Big Tech firms (Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta) saw their indirect carbon emissions rise by 150% from 2020 to 2023 as their AI operations expanded. To expand, that meant building more data centers — physical facilities housing computers and servers that store, process, and transmit data. Data centers are set to increase, not decrease, in the coming years. The International Energy Agency, in an April 2025 report, estimated that “electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double” by 2030, with AI being identified as the most significant driver. And in the United States, where new data centers are aggressively being built, communities are already being impacted: water supply is disrupted, and electricity costs grow as new data centers rise. In the Philippines, there is a growing push for the country to build more data centers, as the government pursues its digital transformation goals. We are for digital transformation, but given how we’ve seen the power-hungry nature of data centers, it’s important that before the supposed data center “boom” comes, sustainability and the effect on communities are given the most serious consideration right away. Already, our climate targets are a mess, and the building of these data centers — left to their own devices — may just become more part of the problem than a solution to progress. Currently, there are 35 data centers in the Philippines, according to datacentermap.com. And here is an important fact that compounds what could be a big problem if we build data centers without due considerations: it’s hot in the Philippines. A Rest of World (RoW) report in November 2025 found that the Philippines is among the 21 countries that operate data centers in some regions where the average annual temperature is above 27°C. The optimal range is from 18°C to 27°C. The RoW report highlights Singapore — Southeast Asia’s “digital core” where 72 data centers are located — and quotes PS Lee who leads the Sustainable Tropical Data Center Testbed: “In thermal terms, Singapore is almost ‘permanent peak summer’ for a data center…. Cooling is both technically harder and structurally more energy-intensive here than in most other data center hubs.” It’s a challenge that Singapore, through the academia and private firms, is now currently trying to solve, with the government having already mandated reduced water and energy consumption for data centers, RoW said. Lee, noting that other countries also have a similar climate profile, hopes that advances by the Testbed may be adopted as well by others in the future. “Many of the world’s fastest-growing digital economies — such as Jakarta, Manila, Ho Chi Minh City, and Mumbai — share similar hot and humid conditions,” Lee said. BusinessWorld reported in October that Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary Henry Aguda is looking to reach 1.5 gigawatts in total data center output by 2028. Currently, the country’s output is at around 200 megawatts. Regional leader Singapore has a capacity of 1.4 gigawatts, followed by Malaysia and Indonesia, both below 1,000 megawatts. Aguda said the DICT wants to promote the Philippines as a data center hub, and plans to round up investments from the US, amid rising global demand. The environmental impact of data centers again made headlines in the US just days ago when its Congress reformed its 1969 National Environmental Policy Act — which pushes for faster permitting for building data centers, at the expense of comprehensive environmental reviews. Days before that, more than 200 environmental groups were protesting, and demanding a halt to new US data centers, citing the aforementioned water shortage and electricity cost issues. In light of all this, how must the Philippines act? We’re a far, far cry from the data center capacity of the US currently rated at more than 53 gigawatts. But we’re also at a tipping point for data center expansion. So before that happens, we ask: what environmental policies do we have in place that would make this expansion — this digital transformation, and these economic efforts to capture demand — sustainable? The UN’s data center sustainability procurement guidelines released back in June are a start. Aside from Singapore, the European Union — via the Energy Efficiency Directive — also started mandating in 2024 that data centers above 500 kilowatts report their power use with very specific metrics. And green efforts will be a smart business decision too. As the ASEAN Briefing notes: “Environmental sustainability is another critical issue [in attracting data center investments]. ESG-compliant (Environmental, Social, and Governance) designs, energy-efficient cooling systems, and integration with renewable energy sources are becoming baseline requirements from international clients and enterprise customers. Developers who fail to meet these expectations may struggle to attract long-term tenants.” But we also know that in the Philippines, environmental concerns can often play fourth or fifth fiddle to profit, “growth,” or personal gain. We know these data centers are coming, so it’s key that we keep a close eye on communities that may be affected when they are constructed — considering too that electricity and water supply continue to be nagging problems in some regions in the country. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Tech Thoughts] Environmental concerns amid rising data center demand in ‘too hot’ PH,https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/data-centers-philippines-rising-demand-impact-environment/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — Singaporeans, Singapore-based Filipinos, and tourists can now enjoy the warmth of Mary Grace’s freshly baked pastries, because the homegrown cafe is opening its first international branch in Singapore soon. The news comes after a successful three-day pop-up in September, where Mary Grace Café sold out its classic, buttery ensaymada and famous cheese rolls to long lines of excited patrons. During the pop-up, a box of six ensaymadas cost $31.50 SGD (P1,418), while a box of six cheese rolls cost $24.50 SGD (P1,103) According to Singaporean travel guide TimeOut, the pop-up sold out its goods despite its “low-key” advertising. “Dear family and friends, The secret’s out: the ovens are warming, the butter’s melting, and something truly special is rising on our sunny shores,” Mary Grace wrote, confirming that they are preparing to open their first store in Singapore. “We’re overjoyed to invite you to be among the first to experience these comforting bites of home — freshly baked with a mother’s love, just as they were 30 years ago,” they added. There are no official details on the exact location, complete menu, and opening date yet; however, the restaurant launched an Instagram account @cafemarygrace.sg and a website where updates will be posted. The household name has been known for its homemade Filipino baked goods and food for over three decades. But before its national success, it all started with the humble home cook, Mary Grace Dimacali, who is a mother of five. The Mary Grace brand, known for “freshly baked goodness daily,” first rose to fame for its ensaymadas, cheese rolls, and cakes. Matriarch Mary Grace, who had no formal background in baking, started selling her homemade ensaymadas in bazaars before selling them at her first mall kiosk at Glorietta 4 in 2000. In 2004, the family opened the first Mary Grace café and has been serving other crowd-favorite, best-selling baked goodies since then, as well as hot meals, sandwiches, pasta, and more. Since its humble beginnings, the cafe now has over 140 outlets in the country. – with reports from Alyana Fabella/Rappler.com Alyana Fabella is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the Ateneo de Manila University.",True,true,"Hello, Singapore!

"NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – Two consumers watchdogs in Bacolod City expressed disappointment with retail magnate Lucio Co’s takeover of the troubled Villar-led PrimeWater Infrastructure Corporation (PrimeWater). Groups Amlig Tubig and Water Watch Advocates (WWA) branded the acquisition as “injustice” to over 70,000 households or water consumers in Bacolod. Co’s Crystal Bridges Holding, Inc. assumed PrimeWater’s role in the controversial 25-year joint venture agreement (JVA) with Bacolod City Water District (BACIWA) that started in November 2020. Bacolod Councilor Wilson “Jun” Gamboa Jr., who is also a convener of Amlig Tubig, believes that despite the takeover, water consumers will still remain in drawback status. The group also calls for the junking of the 2020 JVA. “The JVA is onerous in favor only of PrimeWater, thus, disadvantageous to both BACIWA and the consumers. So, if Co’s Crystal Bridges takes over with the same form of JVA without consulting first the consumers, then, nothing good will happen,” Gamboa said. “It’s illegal ab initio (void from the beginning) simply because it didn’t pass through public consultations,” he added. Gamboa is confident that BACIWA alone can still afford to handle both the management and technicalities of water distribution in Bacolod without PrimeWater or Co’s Crystal Bridges. As to another JVA with Co’s Crystal Bridges, Gamboa said it “should not be labeled as priority.” “For now, just bring back the BACIWA to the people of Bacolod — that’s all ,” he added. WWA convener Wennie Sancho said since the takeover was done in haste without the knowledge of BACIWA executives and Bacolod consumers, then “something [seems suspicious].” Sancho dared BACIWA leaders led by Sonya Verdeflor to hold a dialogue with the consumers and lay down “the truth and nothing but the truth” about the JVA’s status. He also demanded an immediate audit of the financial status of BACIWA. “We want to know the details vis-a-vis what will happen now with the water distribution in Bacolod. WWA cannot afford to see Bacolod water consumers to be [in] limbo,” he said. Meanwhile, Bacolod Lone District Representative Albee Benitez said in a press conference on Thursday, December 18, that Co is set to shell out a P3-billion capital in Bacolod to improve water distribution operations. Benitez also said that the Co group is willing to review the JVA. Benitez also debunked claims that he is one of the incorporators behind Crystal Bridges. Co is now a majority owner of the Bacolod Real Estate Development Corporation port, a business empire founded by Benitez’s grandfather, the late Simplicio Palanca. – Rappler.com",True,true,Lucio Co’s takeover of PrimeWater ‘injustice’ for Bacolod consumers – watchdogs,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/visayas/lucio-co-takeover-primewater-injustice-bacolod-consumers/,Rappler
"It seems DTI’s P500 Noche Buena claim has struck a national nerve — our inbox proves it. Thank you to everyone who urged us to take this topic on. And thank you, too, for your unwavering support and the kind (and often very candid) suggestions that help keep Vantage Point bold, relevant, and fun to read. Our gratitude for your continued trust, the thoughtful insights, and the loyalty you’ve shown us through the years. Your engagement is the reason this column keeps evolving. Very much appreciated. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has finally solved one of the great mysteries of our time: how to feed a Filipino family on Christmas Eve with only P500. In a country where onions once flirted with gold-standard pricing and where ham now comes in artisanal micro-sizes, DTI has done the impossible. They have bent arithmetic so far that Euclid — father of geometry — would file a complaint: transforming policy into a performance art. It began innocently enough. The agency released its annual Noche Buena price guide (see full list at the end of this article), and in it, like a magician pulling a rabbit from a severely stressed hat, it declared that a family could assemble a whole Christmas meal for half a thousand pesos. After the internet collectively choked on its hot chocolate, Trade Secretary Cristina Roque clarified that P500 is not for “lavish” families — just for those comfortable celebrating Christmas on “airline-economy” terms: no legroom, no free drinks, and please clap when we land. Still, the claim demanded investigation. After all, this is the same government that once said rice would hit P20 per kilo — proof that optimism is either the nation’s greatest strength or its most persistent hallucination. DTI’s own numbers show the cheapest ham begins around P170, a price point so low that even supermarket staff stare at it with suspicion. Processed cheese starts at P56.50 — though at that price, it may legally classify as a dairy-adjacent substance. Pasta drops to P32 only if you are willing to buy a pack so small that it suggests the manufacturer has trust issues. Fruit cocktail begins in the P61 range, which is impressive considering 40% of it is syrup, 30% is unidentified cubes, and 30% is existential doubt. Add all-purpose cream at P36.50, mix everything with hope, and the total hovers around P385. Technically, it works — if you use DTI math. DTI math is a special branch of numeracy where everything aligns perfectly on spreadsheets, but not necessarily in physical space, or reality, or kitchens with actual people in them. By their arithmetic, four people can share one small ham, a modest plate of plain spaghetti, and a small bowl of salad with tiny fruit cubes you need to eat with tweezers. You’re no longer treated to a feast, but served a mere concept. It’s a jolly salute to a holiday mood board or a meal for four persons presented in “tokenized” form. The larger problem is that a Christmas Noche Buena basket in the Philippines has not been priced at P500 since… well, since the era when texting cost P1 per message and people still believed Santa Claus could find the Philippines on his first try. Back in 2020, a mid-sized ham cost P135 to P189; queso de bola was between P199 and P320. Today, thanks to inflation and the creative ambitions of meat processors, those numbers have drifted into luxury-boutique territory. Ham now stretches up to P930; queso de bola sits comfortably in the P210 to P445 bracket. Christmas has gentrified. Various holiday basket indices put forth by internet sleuths averaged the cost: from 2011 to 2023, Noche Buena staples rose 25.4%. In 2022, inflation for December hit 8.1% — roughly the same rise as the collective blood pressure of Filipino grocery shoppers that year. Prices have stabilized, but only in the same way a plane stabilizes after losing an engine: it stops dropping, but it’s still nowhere near the altitude it used to be. This is what makes the P500 claim so spectacularly insensitive. It requires the Filipino family to shop with the precision of a hedge fund analyst, the appetite of migrating swallows, and the optimism of someone who still believes government budgeting hearings are straightforward. It requires a household where no one asks for soft drinks, rice, hotdogs, bread, extra serving portions, or joy. It assumes that Christmas is a minimalist Scandinavian experience — ham as accent piece, pasta as decor, fruit salad as garnish for your hopes. It doesn’t help that every Filipino grocery shopper knows the truth. A kilo of mainstream pasta averages P80 to P110. Cheese, cream, and ham swing higher depending on the brand, store, or lunar alignment. One viral grocery post this year documented a mother spending P2,000 for five days of basic meals — an entire week’s worth of food that still didn’t include anything resembling a holiday. So why did DTI insist so forcefully that P500 works? Because somewhere along the line, the agency confused technical possibility with practical reality. They built a feast the way a startup founder builds a pitch deck: everything looks good at the lowest-cost assumptions and none of the variables include human needs or gravity. The irony is that the agency actually has good data. Its price guides are real and useful for tracking food inflation. But instead of saying, “Look, this is how high holiday prices have climbed over the last decade,” it chose to declare, like an overeager accountant, that P500 is absolutely enough if the family practices strict caloric minimalism and embraces the spiritual discipline of ignoring hunger. By now, Vantage Point readers already know that markets punish companies that pretend everything is fine when the financials make it obvious they’re not. Consumers do the same. When the government fails basic addition — taking the cheapest item from every category, adding them up, and declaring it a festive miracle — the public notices. The math doesn’t lie, but the presentation does acrobatics. In the end, the P500 Noche Buena is not a national policy. It is a Christmas fable, written by an agency performing narrative gymnastics to prove that inflation has not stolen Christmas — it has merely “simplified” it. And perhaps, in its own unintentional way, DTI has given the country a new holiday tradition: the annual performance review of math itself. Because if this is how government arithmetic works, next year they may tell us that P300 is enough for Media Noche, P50 can fund a New Year’s fireworks display, and P20 per kilo of rice is just around the corner — operational soon, in theory, pending budget, assuming ideal conditions, adjusting for optimism. Until then, the Filipino consumer will continue doing what they’ve always done: practicing their own math — the kind rooted in grocery receipts, not government spreadsheets. And unlike DTI’s version, their arithmetic always adds up. – Rappler.com",True,true,"[Vantage Point] The P500 Noche Buena: Rewriting math, economics, and the laws of physics",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-noche-buena-budget-controversy-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — Fresh from the Michelin Guide Philippines wins, Filipino kitchens are not slowing down. Chefs are not taking time to rest. And even without award plaques in hand, many names are carrying the proud momentum forward, energized by the global attention as they head into 2026. The excited energy feels less about overnight success and more about what comes next. And because awards are not the sole end goal, the question now is no longer just who made it, but what this pivotal moment means for Filipino dining as a whole. New restaurants, spin-offs, fine dining names, solo chefs taking on bigger projects — the past year has shown just how active and ambitious the local food scene has become. Among those recognized were Manam at The Triangle, which received a Bib Gourmand, and hayop, a Singapore offshoot rooted in Filipino flavors, which was included in the Michelin Guide. Abba Napa, restaurateur and co-founder of The Moment Group, sees this moment not just as validation, but as fuel. “Filipino dining has reached a place of confidence,” Napa told Rappler. “Chefs and restaurants are cooking from a place of clarity — grounded in memory and culture, but expressed with intention and care.” That confidence extends to the diners, Napa noted. Curiosity has grown into openness, then discernment. And with that cycle, the food ecosystem becomes more refined, not just creatively, but culturally. It’s the everyday Filipino diner who has sustained the scene. “People lining up, coming back, celebrating over meals — that’s what has carried Filipino dining to where it is today.” So what did 2025 reveal about Filipino dining, and what do those lessons suggest for the year ahead? Over the past year, Filipino cuisine has continued to evolve in real time, Napa said. This space in range can be seen in local restaurants with menus that reflect deeply traditional to sexily modern interpretations. Recognition such as the Michelin Bib Gourmand, which highlights good food at approachable prices, also shows that, at the core, Filipino food does not need to oversell itself to be appreciated. “Dishes rooted in home cooking, shared tables, and familiar flavors can sit comfortably alongside any global cuisine when they’re executed with consistency,” Napa said. “Filipino flavors are powerful, nuanced, and deeply satisfying when treated with respect and clarity. They don’t need dilution to travel.” This also opens space for risk. Twists on classics are not always immediately embraced, Napa said, citing Manam’s famed Crispy House Sisig and Watermelon Beef Sinigang as examples. But over time, these dishes captured both local and international audiences. Things may just take some time to become part of the collective palate. Filipino restaurants no longer need to fit into a single mold. “What matters is the integrity of its point of view — how clearly it understands its roots and how honestly it translates them onto the plate,” Napa said. This allows more chefs and restaurateurs the freedom to cook from where they stand — geographically, culturally, emotionally — without needing to over-explain. “That freedom is important because it’s healthy for our industry. It encourages depth instead of imitation, and confidence instead of conformity.” Filipino diners love a good atmosphere, sometimes even as much as food. Visuals, space, lighting, ambiance, and mood influence where people eat (and take reels and photos in)! But Napa sees a shift toward something more 360. The focus is no longer just on how a restaurant looks, but on how it feels, and how long people want to stay. That is how they designed Manam’s flagship at Ayala Triangle Gardens, including its branch-exclusive dishes. “There needs to be a style of food — and a brand of hospitality — that can be fully relished. That sense of ease and unhurried energy in the room was a central part of the creative process,” she shared. It sits in the “middle of a rare patch of green in the city,” so people can come to it at any point in the day, and it also allows guests to reserve tables and pre-plan celebrations. And even as menus are evolving alongside spaces, what matters most, she says, is cohesion. Vision, food, service, and atmosphere should work together naturally. “When a restaurant knows who it is, and shows up as that, consistently and passionately, people can feel it.” To succeed, it’s important to know exactly what you’re serving, why, and for whom. Expanding Manam abroad was a risk, so Napa first needed to be clear about what the concept was — and just as importantly, what it wasn’t. “From the beginning, it was never meant to be a broad introduction to Filipino food,” Napa said. Understanding the target market first helps clarify one’s intent. The team wanted a more “focused, expressive take on Filipino flavors,” still grounded in tradition, but presented through a contemporary lens that would make sense within Singapore’s dining culture. “Singaporean diners are incredibly well-traveled and discerning, and they tend to respond to restaurants with a strong point of view and disciplined execution,” Napa shared. She also understood that breaking into a foreign dining landscape is always uncertain; who knows if their locals will even create space for what you’ve painstakingly created? But what grounded Napa was sticking to their intent. “hayop was conceived to portray Filipino food as we understand it. Through the lens of Filipinos born, raised, and living in Manila, shaped by our own experiences and perspectives,” she said, but expressed with restraint, to feel both “distinctive and accessible in that market.” After more than 15 years in the industry, the biggest shift Napa has observed is how eating out has become central to everyday Filipino life. “More than ever, eating out takes up a meaningful share of people’s budgets,” she said. But it’s no longer just about the food. Favorite restaurants have become extensions of the home. “You can see this reflected in how malls have evolved, with food and beverage now taking up a much more prominent role in commercial development footprints than ever before,” Napa added. Part of this shift is the growing appreciation for Filipino cuisine as part of everyday eating, not just for celebrations. Diners also want to know more about what happens behind and around the plate as much as what’s on it: origin stories, the experience, service, atmosphere, and how a restaurant makes you feel. “Dining has become more intentional and emotional. It’s about connection, comfort, and meaning, not just consumption,” Napa said. She foresees Filipino diners becoming even more discerning, searching for restaurants that are clear about who they are, whether casual, refined, or fine dining. But what matters is that as dining habits and food trends evolve, restaurants stay committed to an identity, but don’t feel chained by it. “Together with sensitivity, clarity, and care, the restaurant can remain relevant — because it’s responding to real life, not trends.” After a decade of changes, Napa believes three things will always matter in the F&B industry. First: flavor is first. “It’s sarap (deliciousness) you can trust. Flavors are felt. At the end of the day, walang tatalo sa masarap (nothing can beat the scrumptiousness). Nothing replaces food that delivers consistently. No amount of storytelling, plating, or hype can compensate if the food doesn’t truly land,” she shared. Second: Second: malasakit (empathy). Filipino diners are very sensitive to how they’re made to feel, Napa noted. You need to make every customer feel welcomed, seen, and cared for. “It’s giving that sense that the restaurant genuinely wants you there. It’s not formal service, but ease, generosity, and sincerity.” Third: value beyond price. Not necessarily cheap, but sulit (value for money) — like they’re getting exactly what they’re paying for. “The need to feel that what they receive is fair, generous, and worth returning to,” Napa said. This includes portioning, quality ingredients, consistency, and service. And on the flip side, Napa hopes to see less dining driven by hype alone. Less fluff, less imitation. There needs to be more cooking from the heart; more restaurants “built from conviction rather than ego,” and from a “genuine desire to serve rather than impress.” “The future of dining is strongest when it’s grounded in sincerity,” she said. Rather than a single dominant trend, Napa sees the coming year defined by how chefs will show up. Will it be with a deeper sense of intention? More focus, meaning fewer menu items but with more depth? “That might show up as menus that are more restrained or more anchored in personal memory and place. If that happens, I think it would be an exciting evolution for all of us,” she said. It’s exciting to see how chefs will play their roles. Expressing Filipino identity will be more nuanced, Napa said, “Chefs and restaurateurs will become more comfortable expressing where they come from, letting that come through naturally in both their food and hospitality.” Napa also anticipates stronger ingredient integrity. “Being more thoughtful and intentional about what we put on the plate, and letting good ingredients do more of the talking,” she said. And for diners, all these mean better experiences and more thoughtfulness in where to spend their money. For the industry, it demands discipline, honesty, and sustainability. IIn the long run, Napa foresees that a balance between luxe casual, casual dining, à la carte, family-style, and fine dining leads to resilience. When both consumers and chefs are more deeply invested in the experiences being created, dining out becomes more emotionally resonant. And when Filipinos — who are deeply attuned to emotion — feel connected to a place, they keep coming back. There shouldn’t be a strict delineation between cuisines and service types, either. Napa believes that one does not need to come at the expense of the other. “What feels most exciting is a dining landscape where both coexist — where refinement isn’t defined by formality, and comfort isn’t mistaken for lack of craft. That balance allows diners to choose experiences based on mood, moment, and meaning — and that feels just right, and ultimately a win-win for everyone.” The F&B industry is on the cusp of greater things ahead. We are enjoying both more innovative concepts and deeply rooted menus, told through different narratives and expressions, spotlighting native ingredients and young chefs. But with Napa’s experience and success, she knows it always boils down to one thing: puso. And when the heart leads the way, everything follows — memorable experiences, sincere success, and a flourishing F&B industry for everyone involved. – Rappler.com",True,true,What will Filipino dining look like next year?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/filipino-dining-scene-future-insights-2026/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Po family’s agribusiness continues to ride the global consumer shift toward healthy food and active lifestyles. Agribusiness conglomerate and food exporter Century Pacific Food Incorporated (Century Pacific) said on Thursday, October 16 that it acquired another integrated coconut processing facility in Mindanao, this time in Tupi, South Cotabato, from legacy firm Roxas and Company for P2.6 billion. Century Pacific, which supplies raw material for the international coconut water brand Vita Coco, said the acquisition would boost its coconut processing capacity. “Across the globe, the demand for coconut products is on the rise, underpinned by long-term shifts toward healthier consumption and wellness-oriented lifestyles. As one of the world’s top coconut producers, the Philippines enjoys a competitive edge, with Century Pacific among its emerging players playing in both export and domestic markets,” Century Pacific said in a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange. Last January, Century Pacific renewed its long-term P14-billion contract with The Vita Coco Company, which has become a leader in coconut water globally. Global pop icons such as Madonna and Rihanna, as well as sports celebrities like American tennis player Amanda Anisimova, have endorsed Vita Coco. A post shared by Vita Coco (@vitacoco) Coconut water is being marketed as a “natural source of electrolytes and antioxidants” that are needed for good health and hydration. In 2024, Century Pacific’s growth was driven by its OEM exports such as coconut water concentrates. The company attributed the 36% growth year-on-year to “a favorable commodity cycle and strong demand for healthier products.” Century Pacific said the acquisition of the integrated coconut facility was via its wholly owned subsidiary Coco Harvest Incorporated, which bought it from Roxas and Company subsidiary Roxas Sigma Agriventures Incorporated. “The plant currently produces high-value coconut products such as coconut cream, coconut milk, virgin coconut oil, and coconut water concentrate. Planned enhancements will further expand its capabilities to serve both domestic and export markets, adding new product lines and improving overall efficiency,” Century Pacific said. Century Pacific has two other coconut processing hubs in Mindanao, one in General Santos City, and another in Misamis Occidental. Roxas and Company said proceeds from the sale of this facility will be used to pay off the debts and liabilities of Roxas Sigma. It was also in line with the legacy firm’s decision to focus on developing its landholdings in Nasugbu, Batangas. Roxas Sigma’s coconut processing facility started commercial operations in 2018 producing all-natural coconut cream and milk, coconut water concentrate, and virgin coconut oil to clients worldwide. It has around 150 regular workers. The facility it sold is also a big buyer of dehusked nuts and helps provide livelihood in South Cotabato. “We are confident that Century’s plans to upgrade the facility will usher in a new phase of growth and expanded product offerings,” said Antonio Roxas, Roxas Sigma’s business development manager. With the acquisition, Century Pacific said its coconut operations will employ around 800 workers in Mindanao. “This acquisition is a milestone for our coconut business and a testament to our commitment to inclusive growth. By expanding our capacity in coconuts, we not only enhance our competitiveness in the global coconut industry but also create meaningful economic opportunities for local communities in Mindanao,” said Noel Tempongko, vice president and general manager of Century Pacific’s OEM Coconut Exports. An OEM or Original Equipment Manufacturer produces raw materials or parts that another company needs. “The additional capacity will allow us to innovate and serve the market with more high-quality, better-for-you coconut products, supporting our mission to deliver affordable nutrition to our consumers,” Tempongko added. Century Pacific ventured into the coconut industry in 2012, manufacturing coconut water for OEM exports. It also produces and exports the coconut water brand Aqua Coco. It has since expanded its manufacturing capabilities to include a wider range of products such as Coco Mama Fresh Gata. In 2020, Century Pacific ventured into the vegan meat alternative with its unMEAT products. Aside from the Philippines, these products are now sold in over 13,000 points of sale in the US, Singapore, China, Middle East, and Europe. A post shared by unMEAT (@meetunmeat.ph) The Century Pacific Group was started in 1978 by Ricardo Po Sr., focused on exporting canned tuna, with famous brands like Century Tuna, 555, and Ligo. It has since grown the business into other food-related businesses, including meat (e.g. Argentina brand), and dairy (e.g. Birch Tree, Angel). – Rappler.com",True,true,Century Pacific buys another coconut facility.

"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia – Trade negotiations between the Philippines and United States continue three months after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. trekked to Washington, DC, to meet US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Malaysia on Monday, October 27, Palace press officer Undersecretary Claire Castro said there are “comprehensive issues” that must be tackled first, as the two nations iron out the fine details of the agreement. Castro was citing Frederick Go, Marcos’ special assistant for investment and economic affairs. The issues, Go told Castro, include trade rules and regulations, non-tariff measures such as services and investments, and products that the Philippines wants to “protect” such as rice, sugar, and chicken, and exports such as coconuts, pineapple, electronics. “At ‘yan po, ilan po ito sa mga hindi po sa ngayon makakayang i-negotiate ng basta-basta ng Pilipinas. So nando’n pa rin po ang pakikipag-usap para po ‘yung ibang mga produkto natin ay hindi na nga po maapektuhan,” said Castro. (So those are among the reasons why, for now, it’s hard for the Philippines to negotiate [with the US]. We are still in discussions to ensure that our products are not affected [adversely].) On the sidelines of the 47th ASEAN Summit, the United States signed trade agreements with the bloc’s chair Malaysia, as well as Cambodia. The US also signed framework trade deals with Vietnam and Thailand. In late July 2025, following a meeting with Marcos in the Oval Office, Trump announced a 19% rate for the Philippines, and claimed zero tariffs for US products entering the Philippines. Prior to that meeting, Trump announced the US would be imposing a 20% tariff on Philippine products, a rate that was three percentage points higher than the 17% that was initially planned to be imposed on Manila. The 19% rate was meant to kick in on August 1. Negotiations have been ongoing since then. Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez told Rappler the conclusion of talks is “not too far [away].” – Rappler.com",True,true,"3 months later, US-Philippine trade negotiations not done yet",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/united-states-trade-deal-negotiations-october-27-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The global think tank Tony Blair Institute on Thursday, July 24, released a report outlining how government strategies on leveraging AI technology for the economy should focus on a human-centric “augmented” approach rather than allowing for the outright automation of tasks. The paper recalls how previous industrial revolutions such as mechanization in the 18th century led to physical labor being superseded by machines — a shift that governments then responded to by prioritizing education that would open opportunities for cognitive work. Now, that cognitive work is at the risk of being replaced by generative AI, which has shown the capacity to process information and data, and produce something out of it such as computer code, a written analysis, or a new image or video. The institute proposes what it calls “augmented intelligence,” an approach that seeks to empower the worker to use AI as a tool, and allow themselves to perform “higher-order tasks.” “By embedding machine-generated insights into workflows, this approach enables a broader segment of the workforce – particularly those in practical, hands-on roles — to perform higher-order tasks such as data interpretation, situational judgement and adaptive decision-making to make roles more productive, meaningful and futureproofed,” the institute says. Examples include care assistants using AI to monitor their patient’s wellbeing, electrical technicians using AI-enabled drones and diagnostics to make repairs, or paramedics using AI to provide timely, critical insights. “In short, augmented intelligence is about creating new kinds of jobs that combine human empathy, judgement and adaptability with the power of AI,” it says. Human empathy, judgement, and adaptability, among other humanistic traits, appear to remain as part of a person’s domain and not that of an AI system’s at least for now. Just as humans found a way to specialize in cognitive work as mechanical tools took over physical labor in the past, the challenge now, as the paper shows, is to find the tasks that only a human is able to achieve. The study looks at 3 countries — Singapore, Vietnam, and the Phlippines — and presents an overview of the challenges that each faces in adopting the “augmented intelligence” approach. In the Philippines, the paper provides 4 examples how this approach might look like in several industries: How does the country get there? The report notes several government initiatives that point to a development vision that has AI squarely in its sights. Under the Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028, the National AI Strategy Roadmap 2.0, and Philippine Skills Framework, AI and digitalization are looked at as major components in fostering economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. The AI roadmap presents a plan for integrating AI into key industries, while the skills framework seeks to align educational outcomes with the AI-related jobs of the future. The Department of Education also established The Education Center for AI Research in February 2025 while the National Innovation Council, directly under the President, established an AI thinktank in March 2025 that seeks to inform AI policies and improve the country’s global competitiveness. All of these initiatives are meant to steer the populace to an AI-enabled economy wherein generative AI is expected to contribute P2.8 trillion by 2030, the report says. Will the country get there? The study outlines a few major hurdles. First of all, connectivity remains an issue, especially when one compares connectivity in the cities versus the provinces. It says that policies should “address the urban-rural digital divide by expanding access to affordable digital infrastructure, such as connectivity, and training programs.​” The government needs to come in to help smaller businesses, and industries in the province to address a digital gap that slows down AI adoption. Increasing funding for AI research as well as incentivizing the development of homegrown digital solutions are seen as necessary pillars to help the country reach its AI goals. Upskilling, with the proposed “augmented intelligence” approach will also be urgently needed as the International Monetary Fund expects that 4 out of 10 jobs in the Philippines will be affected by AI. Cybersecurity is a part of the picture as well, as data breaches may erode the trust people have in digital systems. “Stakeholders emphasized the need for a shift towards more proactive policies in which governments do not merely mitigate risks, but actively shape AI adoption to create economic and social value. This shift will include fostering public-private partnerships, setting clear regulatory frameworks, and incentivizing local innovation ecosystems and entities to flourish,” the study says. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Gov’t-led AI plans underway but infrastructure, skills need addressing – think tank",https://www.rappler.com/technology/philippines-ai-plans-roadmap-2025-digital-infrastructure-upskilling/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – There’s a particular kind of optimism that shows up around New Year’s. You open your banking app with the seriousness of someone about to turn their whole life around, promise yourself you’ll be more “disciplined” this time, and then quietly hope that motivation will carry you through February, March, and the months when the calendar stops feeling symbolic. It won’t. Not because you’re weak-willed, but because good money habits work best as systems. If you want 2026 to feel different, you don’t need to do some dramatic overhaul of your personal finances. Instead, let’s start with these three boring things done consistently: set a goal you can measure, build a budget you can actually live with, and, if you have room, start dipping your toes into investing with your eyes open. Most people begin the year with intentions that feel responsible but are impossible to follow. “Save more.” “Spend less.” “Be better with money.” All good ideas — but unfortunately all directionless. A useful goal is specific enough that you can’t argue with it. It has a number and a deadline. It is not purely aspirational, but it should still feel slightly difficult, because that tension is what forces you to adjust your spending behavior. One simple place to start is an emergency fund. The basic target many people aim for is around three months of salary set aside for emergencies. So, where do you put your emergency fund? You shouldn’t chase yield here or park it in an investment product. Prioritize liquidity because you need speed and certainty of access when something goes wrong. Keep your emergency fund in a stable bank account you can tap quickly, ideally one with reliable online banking and easy ATM access where you live. But even “build an emergency fund” can remain vague unless you break it into checkpoints. It’s easier to commit to a halfway marker than to a year-long fog. A goal might look like this: “By June 2026, I should have at least one month’s worth of salary parked in my emergency fund.” That’s a concrete milestone you can hit halfway through the year, and it’s easy to verify. After goals, most people run straight into budgeting, and this is where a lot of plans quietly die. They pick an overly strict number, decide they will be a new person starting January, and then spend the rest of the month feeling like they failed when real life refuses to cooperate. A budget only works if it is built on what you actually do. That’s why tracking comes first. In the Philippines, that tracking can be annoying. Most of the time, you can’t simply link your bank debit or credit card to an app and have everything recorded automatically. You may have to manually log expenses in your budget app of choice as you go, which feels tedious. But just remember you need this data to form a reasonable baseline. The categories don’t need to be fancy. What matters is that they reflect the way your life is actually structured. For me, it’s groceries, utilities, rent, dining out, pets, transportation, and a small amount of fun money. That last category matters more than people admit. If you pretend you won’t spend on anything enjoyable, you’ll eventually spend anyway, just messier and with more regret. Now, after at least two months of tracking, you’ll have an idea of how much on average you spend per category. This can form the baseline for your budget. When setting your budget, the goal is not to squeeze every category to the point of misery. The goal is to make sure you are living below your means in a way that doesn’t rely on constant self-denial. One practical approach is to treat savings like a bill. Decide on a set percentage of your take-home pay that you will move to savings every month, perhaps up to 20% if you have that room, and then build your budget around what’s left. You’re flipping the logic around from saving whatever remains at the end to spending whatever remains after you saved. Rent is the biggest pressure point for many people, and it’s also the easiest category to let quietly take over your entire financial life. A commonly used benchmark is to try to keep rent within 30% of take-home pay. That is not always possible, but it is still a useful reference because it forces you to see the tradeoff clearly. If rent is taking more than that, the question becomes what you are giving up in exchange, and whether the exchange is still worth it. There’s a reason investing advice can feel alienating. A lot of people are still trying to stabilize, and it’s hard to talk about building wealth when you’re busy working to pay the rent. Not everyone is on the same timeline, and that’s fine. But if you do have some flexibility, investing is one of the few tools that can meaningfully change your long-term trajectory. You don’t need to start big. Starting with P1,000 to P5,000 can be enough to begin building familiarity, which is a bigger hurdle than most people realize. The first stage of investing is about simply learning how to react when prices move, when headlines feel scary, and when you’re tempted to do something impulsive. That’s why risk appetite matters. It just means knowing how much risk you can tolerate without panicking. After all, no investment is risk-free. Here’s a quick look at the different types of investments you can get into and their associated risk. Bonds are often described as stable and low-risk. The simplest way to understand them is that you are lending money to the government or a corporation and earning interest. Usually, they also come with a defined timeframe, which makes them easier to plan around. Save for a financial crisis, they’re usually safe too as whoever issuing the bond wouldn’t want to permanently tarnish their reputation by failing to meet payments. The catch is liquidity. If you need the money before the bond term ends, you may have to sell it on the secondary market, sometimes at a discount, and the process can feel less straightforward than selling a stock. Stocks are a different kind of commitment and are significantly riskier than bonds. They are more liquid and can offer more growth, but they require you to be intentional. Every stock is its own story, which means you need to know what you’re buying and why. Are you buying for growth or for dividends? What industry are you betting on? What rules will you follow for taking profit or cutting loss? If you enter without rules, the market will supply its own, and you won’t like them. For people who want exposure without constantly monitoring individual stocks, mutual funds and UITFs can be a middle path. They can help spread risk and allow you to tap professional management, which is useful if you don’t have the time or interest to do your own deep research. Funds can also be a way to get exposure to markets that feel harder to access directly, including US tech stocks, depending on what products are available to you. But you still need to understand what the fund holds, what timeframe it is built for, and what fees you are paying for that management. Fees matter because they quietly eat returns, especially over long holding periods. Then there are alternatives assets like crypto and precious metals, which tend to attract people who are bored by slow progress. Crypto can make people rich, and it can also wipe people out, sometimes faster than they thought possible. Gold tends to move differently from other assets and is often treated as a hedge when stock prices fall. These instruments can have a place for some people, but ideally as a smaller part of a broader mix, not the foundation of your entire financial life. – Rappler.com Finterest is Rappler’s series that demystifies the world of money and gives practical advice on managing your personal finances.",True,true,[Finterest] Start 2026 strong with these personal finance tips,https://www.rappler.com/business/finterest-start-strong-personal-finance-tips-2026/,Rappler

"What began as an attempt to defraud a manager of the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) evolved into an opportunity for the country’s oldest bank to learn how scammers transfer funds from their victims’ accounts. In a media roundtable on Wednesday, October 22, BPI’s enterprise information security officer and data protection officer Jon Paz said scammers tried to defraud a channel manager of the bank’s online platform. Paz recalled the manager receiving an email claiming that he needed to update his eGovPH mobile app, and that the sender could help him do this if he filled out a Google Form. “[Up] To this point, all of our knowledge about rogue apps, how these work, had all been anecdotal. They were reported to us by victims,” Paz said. So, they instructed the manager to click the link and input his details with the hopes of understanding the scheme. The manager then received a follow-up call where the scammer requested him to install a remote servicing application masked as the latest version of the eGovPH app. This app gave the caller complete control over the victim’s phone. From there, the scammer disabled key security settings, allowing him to “sideload” or download an application that is not from the phone’s official app store. Paz said this is where things got tricky. The manager’s phone displayed an app installation, but BPI’s IT and data protection team saw something else unfolding behind the scenes. “So what’s being presented to the user is an installation sequence…But behind that, what’s happening is that they’re tinkering with the configurations to allow the app to do a lot more,” he said. Using a fake screen to deceive the victim, the scammer secretly used the login information he obtained to access online banking accounts installed on the phone. Once he gained access to the victim’s bank accounts, the scammer would transfer the funds to his or her own accounts. But online banking apps usually require biometrics or a one-time password (OTP) to complete the transaction. How do scammers get past that? According to Paz, the fake eGovPH app shown to the victim requests for the user’s biometrics to log in. But behind the fake screen, the victim unknowingly authorized the fund transfer to the scammer’s account. Luckily, no funds were stolen in this incident. BPI’s data protection team closely monitored the scammer’s movements, and the attempted fund transfers did not push through since the receiving account was already flagged for its suspected use in scams. Rogue applications or malware are just one of many ways that scammers trick their victims into giving up their login credentials. Scammers also use International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers to send phishing text messages to victims. IMSI catchers, according to a previous Rappler report, “intercept devices by simulating or mimicking cell towers. When connected to an IMSI catcher, calls and text messages as well as a device’s location can be accessed without detection.” Paz said these texts can be compelling since they pretend to be legitimate entities like banks. Global anti-scam application Whoscall logged 62,390 scam calls in the Philippines during the third quarter, 78.4% higher since 2024. (READ: Don’t let online scammers escape. Dial 1326 and report) As scammers employ more sophisticated tactics, BPI’s chief technology officer Alex Seminiano said the bank is strengthening its app’s security through consistent updates and consumer education campaigns. Fraudsters can’t find more victims if no one falls for their tactics. Seminiano urged the public not to share their authentication credentials such as passwords and OTPs with anyone, and enable multi-factor account authentication. “The whole security mechanism of banking is based on trust identification,” Seminiano said. “And therefore, if you share your credentials to somebody else, and somebody else pretends to be you, it’s very difficult to really identify that.” – Rappler.com",True,true,A failed scam attempt gave BPI a glimpse into how fraudsters take your money,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/failed-scam-attempt-bpi-glimpse-how-fraudsters-take-money/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Gokongwei family’s Universal Robina Corporation (URC) said it is repairing a collapsed portion of a lagoon that released around 255,000 cubic meters of molasses wastewater into Bais Bay in Negros Island which may affect the Tañon Strait Protected Seascape in the Visayas. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Monday, November 3, URC said 127 personnel and 20 Coast Guard members are repairing the collapsed section of its Bais Distillery’s 20-hectare pond. URC initially vowed to finish repairing the dike by Tuesday, November 4. However, it said in a statement on Wednesday, November 5, that it now aims to complete repairs by November 14 due to additional reinforcement work. “The recent typhoon did not affect the integrity of the main dike nor escalate the contamination of the seawater from the collapsed lagoon, though it did cause some delay in the completion of repair,” URC said. URC earlier said the repair work was “60% complete,” and that the new dike will be reinforced and strengthened by rubber tires and boulders. “Regarding the marine clean-up, we are in close coordination with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and other stakeholder agencies to deploy experts who will help contain the spilled wastewater within a limited area and guide the Company, local and other relevant authorities on how best to foster marine re-growth and recovery,” URC said on Monday. The settling pond’s collapse on Sunday, October 26, released contaminated wastewater that also reached the popular Majuyod white sandbar. The Negros Island Region’s Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) earlier issued an interim cease and desist order and a second notice of violation against the Gokongwei firm for illegal wastewater discharge. The EMB’s initial assessments found that 382.3 hectares of coastal and marine areas were affected by the spill. According to URC and the EMB, management reported cracks in the lagoon following aftershocks from the magnitude 6.9 and 7.4 earthquakes that struck Cebu and Davao Oriental on September 30 and October 10, respectively. The cracks then worsened due to the heavy rainfall on Saturday, October 25, and on succeeding days. The DENR said, in a statement on Saturday, November 1, that initial water quality assessments conducted by the DENR-Environment Management Bureau “indicate low levels of dissolved oxygen in affected waters, a condition that may cause fishkills and other adverse impacts on aquatic ecosystems.” The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Region 7 has issued an advisory prohibiting fishing and consumption of aquatic products from the affected areas. The DENR said it would conduct a review of URC’s Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) and other permits. “As warranted by law, the Department will initiate administrative, civil, and criminal proceedings against responsible parties,” the agency said. The Biodiversity Management Bureau, the DENR said, will undertake with experts the “economic valuation of environmental damages and assess long-term impacts on the Tañon Strait coastal and marine ecosystems.” The Tañon Strait Protected Seascape, which connects the Visayan Sea to the Bohol Sea, serves as a feeding and breeding ground for various marine species such as migratory whales and dolphins. URC told the local bourse that the company has temporarily ceased operations of the Bais Distillery. The distillery produces “high grade anhydrous ethanol for gasoline blending, using molasses which is a by-product in the manufacture of raw sugar from sugarcane as feedstock,” according to the company website. It has a capacity of 100,000 liters per day. “The company has been providing for the needs of the families affected by the spill and will continue to do so until the situation goes back to normal,” the manufacturer said. – Rappler.com",True,true,Universal Robina vows repair of lagoon after Bais wastewater spill,https://www.rappler.com/business/universal-robina-vows-repair-tailing-pond-bais-negros-oriental-molasses-spill/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Private dining often means booking a separate function room or tucked-away corner at a restaurant. At Flame, the signature restaurant of Discovery Primea in Makati City, however, the concept has been reimagined — its new “private dining” experience that lets guests rent out entire sections — or even the whole restaurant itself — for special occasions, meetings, conferences, and the like. Set on the hotel’s top floor, Flame provides panoramic views of Makati’s skyline, which has become a popular backdrop for gatherings, dates, and events. Guests can choose from several spaces: the Urdaneta Dining Room and Wing are bright and serene, looking out to the greenery of Urdaneta Village below. These areas can accommodate up to 30 to 40 guests for plated or buffet meals, or up to 60 for cocktails. The Ayala Dining Room, overlooking Ayala Avenue and the city center, offers a more dynamic atmosphere suited to both professional and social events, filled with natural light. It can accommodate up to 30 guests for plated or buffet dining, 40 seated for cocktails, or 50 standing. For open-air celebrations, Flame Al Fresco offers a front-row seat to the sky lights of Makati, Rockwell, and BGC. Guests may also book a full restaurant buyout, combining views from both the Ayala and Urdaneta sides. When the entire space is booked, hotel guests and other diners are ushered to a separate dining area within the hotel. Chef Luis Chikiamco of Flame created a new set of menus specifically for private dining, showcasing Flame’s balance of global flavors and refined presentation. Rates start at P1,800 per guest for a Western-style breakfast buffet, or P2,000 for a plated version. Brunch menus, priced at P2,500 per guest, feature Asian-inspired and Western dishes. Guests can also customize themed dinners, afternoon teas, or even 10-course degustation menus. There’s also an à la carte menu — dishes include the burrata salad with grape jam and cherry tomatoes, and a Josper-grilled Canadian striploin with truffle potato pavé and roasted king oyster mushrooms (Flame is known for its expertly grilled meats; hence, the name). Flame’s Gianduja chocolate bar with hazelnut praline and chocolate soil also makes a worthy appearance. Rates for private dining start at P45,000++ for breakfast or lunch from Monday to Thursday, and P50,000++ on weekends and holidays. The full rates can be found on the website. “Every detail — from the skyline views to the cuisine and service — is designed to create moments worth celebrating,” said David Pardo de Ayala, general manager of Discovery Primea. – Rappler.com",True,true,"At Discovery Primea’s Flame, private dining is a full restaurant experience",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/discovery-primea-flame-private-dining-restaurant-experience/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — For many young adults, romantic relationships have become both a source of joy and a source of emotional strain. Yet when we hear about couples counseling, people often imagine it as something for married couples or long-term partners, not for students or young couples still figuring things out. But the truth is, relationship struggles among the youth can take a serious toll on mental health. In recent years, psychiatrists from the Department of Health–National Center for Mental Health (DOH–NCMH) have noted that breakups or unresolved relationship issues often trigger many cases of emotional distress and even psychotic breakdowns. The NCMH crisis hotline also reported thousands of calls from individuals aged 18 to 30, with love and relationship problems ranking among the top reasons for seeking help. Now, more than ever, it’s clear that young love deserves care and guidance, too. To understand how counseling can support this, Rappler spoke with Dr. Rolando de los Reyes II, a guidance services specialist at the University of the Philippines Diliman. He shared that the university’s Office of Counseling and Guidance (OCG) addresses three major areas of concern among students: academic, career, and problems of daily living, including romantic relationship. Couple counseling gives students a safe space to navigate love, conflict, and communication in healthier ways. In De los Reyes’ years of counseling work, he observed that one of the most common sources of conflict among young couples is their difference in upbringing, the invisible blueprint that shapes who we are. “I always tell people that this relationship, or this union, isn’t just between two individuals, but between two families,” he explained. “Each person is brought up differently.” We are, after all, creatures of habit. The way we were raised molds our values, behaviors, and daily practices. These ingrained patterns inevitably surface in relationships, sometimes clashing with our partner’s own. De los Reyes added that these differences in upbringing often lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication, not just in major decisions, but in the smallest, most ordinary things that make up daily life. He shared that for some lived-in couples, simple habits like bathroom use can quietly disrupt routines and cause conflict. Young couples are often more vulnerable to outside influences. Many students still live with or rely on their parents, which can sometimes give family members space to meddle in the relationship. Peers, on the other hand, shape how couples perceive and handle love. We turn to friends for advice, compare our relationships to theirs, and even adapt to the standards or culture within our social circles. Within one’s friend group, for example, we create a sense of what’s considered normal, so when partners come from different circles, it can be hard to meet in the middle. De los Reyes explained that this “culture” within different social environments also influences their sense of time, availability, priorities, and even the way they communicate. Some couples he has counseled from different universities or degree programs often struggle to find balance because their daily realities simply don’t align. These gaps in experience and lifestyle create invisible pressures. According to De los Reyes, setting up couples counseling usually begins after an individual consultation, where one of the partners would bring up their relationship concern. “I usually ask the person, ‘Would your partner be open to couples counseling?’” he noted. Consent, he emphasized, is an utmost priority. Both partners must be willing and in full agreement to attend the sessions. If one of them refuses, individual counseling remains available for the inquiring partner. When it comes to the procedure, UPD OCG offers three free sessions: individual consultations for each partner, followed by a joint session. He begins by meeting them separately to encourage openness and to understand whether they share the same concerns within the relationship. While the free sessions are limited, De los Reyes noted, sometimes, the case requires a series of counseling sessions. He also encouraged couples to commit to follow-up sessions when needed. Even in counseling, he said, consistency can be a challenge. “Sometimes after the couple’s counseling, they feel better already,” he said. However, he added that issues tend to resurface when some matters remain unresolved. The UPD OCG primarily offers couple counseling sessions for UP constituents, but De los Reyes shared that they also extend their services to non-UP partners upon request to their Facebook messenger or email. With stigma toward mental health services still existing, many people misconstrue couples counseling as a last resort for relationships on the brink. But in reality, it signifies the opposite: a willingness to work through challenges together. Counseling reflects a relationship in progress, one where both partners are learning to recognize their values, understand each other better, and take mindful steps forward. During the sessions, De los Reyes shared that he often gives couples small “assignments” to help them pause and reflect before making big decisions. “I always tell this to couples and even to individuals: never make decisions when you’re emotionally high or low. Because most of the time, your decisions will be wrong,” he said. He noted that some couples break up in the heat of emotion, only to regret it and reconcile, until this becomes a pattern. To help them assess things more clearly, he gives an exercise called a cost-benefit analysis. It’s an individual reflection that weighs whether the relationship benefits or costs the person more. The key, he emphasized, is to do this separately to see “the real score,” free from each other’s influence. Another common assignment he gives is listing personal values. He recalled a couple he once counseled who initially struggled because of the girl’s focus on physical appearance. After writing down her list of values and realizing that looks weren’t even part of it, her perspective shifted, and the couple is now a family. “Sometimes it takes a lot of [work], because sometimes we put our standards with the standards of the world,” De los Reyes said. In the end, these exercises remind couples that conflicts often arise from external influences — expectations, opinions, or ideals that don’t always align with their own. For a relationship to work, both partners must learn to tune those out and focus instead on what truly matters between the two of them. While social support is important, counseling offers a guided, deliberate space that encourages reflection before making decisions. Sometimes, when we confide in friends, the advice we receive can be hasty or emotionally charged, often leading to impulsive breakups. In counseling, however, the goal isn’t always separation. If anything, it’s about recognizing where a couple can meet halfway. “The basic premise for a couple, for a partnership to flourish, openness, trust, and compromise,” said De los Reyes. Openness, he explained, begins with honest communication. Some of his clients create their own “communication cues,” signals that tell a partner when to pause or stop talking during a session when things become overwhelming or when the discussion starts going in circles. These cues help prevent arguments from escalating and promote mutual understanding. Openness also helps prevent emotions from bottling up. “I don’t want to be sexist here or anything, pero, ang mga lalaki minsan napaka-dense, (men can be dense)” he said, noting how simple expressions often bridge emotional gaps. Compromise, on the other hand, happens once both partners have identified their values. In many of the conflicts he has encountered, compromise is often the missing piece. For young couples juggling studies, limited time together can be mistaken for neglect. But through understanding, even small gestures like quick updates or check-ins can help maintain a connection. He also cited a case familiar to UP students: couples divided by political beliefs. He cited varsity and activist couples arguing over the commercialized establishment Dilimall within the UP grounds, owned by major figures who also sponsor the varsity team. Even with issues like this, De los Reyes emphasized that couples must discuss them. He encouraged putting oneself in their partner’s shoes to recognize their mindset and values and find a way to compromise. Young couples may still be figuring things out, but that doesn’t mean they’re incapable of building something meaningful. With the right guidance, relationships can become a space for growth — a learning curve that teaches patience, communication, and empathy. In a time when social media often paints love as effortless, bound by perfect compatibility and soulmate narratives, it’s easy to forget that real love takes work. – Rappler.com Trixia Policarpio is a Rappler intern studying BA Creative Writing at University of the Philippines Diliman.",True,true,"Love is hard, but here’s how couples counseling helps make it easy",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/couples-counseling-experience-therapist-advice/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines plans to extend its rice import ban until the end of 2025 to help lift farmgate prices of palay (unmilled rice), Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said on Sunday. Tiu Laurel said the country had imported an excess supply of about 800,000 metric tons as of end-September, bringing total rice imports for the January-September period to 3.5 million MT. “I-extend na ho ang import stoppage until end of 2025,” Laurel said Monday, October 6, during a briefing at the House of Representatives. (The import stoppage will be extended until the end of 2025.) Through Executive Order 93, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered a 60-day import ban starting September following reports of palay prices plunging below P10 per kilogram. Part of the plan, according to the agriculture chief, is to resume importation by January 2026 to augment rice supply by 300,000 MT before implementing the import ban again from February to April to coincide with the harvest season. This is “more or less approved” by the President already, said Laurel, although an order from the Palace has yet to come out. Palay farmgate prices dipped to as low as P7.50/kilo (fresh palay) according to price monitoring reports of regional offices from September 29 to October 3, said DA Undersecretary Christopher Morales during the briefing. Another measure the government can take in case importation continues, said Laurel, is to increase tariffs to 35% again. Farmers’ groups have been calling for the government to reinstate the 35% levy, saying the tariff cut failed to lower prices. Tariff reversion had been supported by the House mega-panel that investigated rice and agricultural prices. The Senate has adopted a similar position as well. Public advocacy group Foundation for Economic Freedom took an opposing position, saying a liberalized market will ensure food security and affordability for consumers. FEF said in a statement Monday that the import ban was “a failure” as farmgate palay prices hover from P8 to P14 per kilo, which is still lower than production cost. The government’s second option — which is to raise tariffs — will only contribute to the increase the country’s overall inflation, said FEF. More than 110 million Filipinos are consuming rice on a daily basis, the group pointed out. “In other words, from a sheer cost-benefit analysis perspective, raising rice tariff to 35% will only benefit less than 5% of the total population while penalizing 95% of the Filipino rice consumers,” said FEF. What the group recommends is that government maintain the tariff rate, lift the import ban, improve productivity of local rice industry, provide local cash assistance, and ensure decent income for farmers. “Such interventions might be a good political move on the part of our politicians but will be economically and financially onerous to the millions of Filipino consumers,” FEF said. – Rappler.com",True,true,Gov’t to extend rice import ban until end of 2025,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/government-extend-rice-import-ban-2025/,Rappler
"Before the SM Group bought a controlling stake in National University (NU) in 2008, NU had only one campus, in Sampaloc, Manila, with around 1,800 students. It also wasn’t doing well financially and was having difficulty getting enrollees after a fire destroyed its main building in 1998. Today, 17 years after the Sy family took over management of the school, it has around 84,000 students in 14 campuses with 4,000 faculty members. NU now has more students than the state university, UP (around 66,000 students for the whole UP system as of 2025). NU is unofficially the biggest school in terms of student population among the eight schools in the UAAP, which include Adamson University, Ateneo de Manila University (AdMU), Far Eastern University (FEU), De La Salle University (DLSU), University of the East (UE), University of the Philippines (UP), and University of Santo Tomas (UST). In the next two years, NU will add three more campuses: NU in Davao City, its 15th campus and its first in Mindanao, in 2026; NU in Iloilo City in 2027; and NU in Urdaneta, Pangasinan. It is also expanding four campuses: in NU Clark (Pampanga), NU Mall of Asia (Pasay), NU Fairview (Quezon City), and its main campus in Sampaloc, Manila. NU, one of the founders of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), used to be the perennial doormat in the league. After the SM Group took over, it’s been dominating the UAAP Cheerdance competition, and it made history on Saturday, November 29, after winning its 9th crown overall, one more than UP and UST. In 2014, NU, under then-head coach Eric Altamirano, defeated FEU and won it’s second men’s basketball championship in UAAP Season 77 after a 60-year drought. As of Sunday, November 30, the NU Bulldogs had the best record in Season 88 of the men’s basketball tournament going into the Final Four games which start on Wednesday, December 3. (READ: NU championship is a dream come true for member of 1954 Bulldogs team) NU has also been doing well in the now popular team sport of volleyball. The NU men’s team has won the past five UAAP volleyball championships, while the NU women’s team, led by star player Bella Belen, won the last two. How did the SM Group achieve these? Many perhaps think it’s because the Sy family has a lot of money, but it can be argued that taipan Lucio Tan also has the resources, but has not had the same success for the UAAP school he owns, UE. So, while money is important, there are other factors at play. SM founder Henry Sy’s college education was interrupted by World War II. He knew early on the importance of education as a great equalizer. He had set his sights on buying his alma mater FEU, but talks with its controlling owners, the Montinola family, didn’t pan out. The SM Group, however, still has a minority stake in FEU. He then pursued merger talks with the owners of NU, founded by Mariano Fortunato Jhocson in 1900. The school is commemorating its 125th year this 2025 with a grand celebration and concert at SM MOA Sky Ampitheater on Friday, December 5. After 10 years of merger talks, Sy bought a 60% majority stake in NU in 2008. Hans, in a recent NU1900 podcast, said his late father had always been a believer in education, and wanted providing affordable quality education to be his legacy. The Sy patriarch, fondly called “Tatang,” was already 80 when the SM Group took over management of NU in 2008, and he assigned to his fourth child, Hans, the task of rebuilding NU. Hans is chairman of NU. Meritocracy and a more professional management of NU was pushed, following the SM Group’s takeover. NU vice chairman and former NU president Teodoro J. Ocampo, a third-generation member of the Jhocson family, recalled that before the SM Group took over, all the key positions in NU were held by the children of the owners — from chairman, president, comptroller, registrar, athletic office, and purchasing office. “It was very close-knit, so you can imagine them not being open-minded to having partners,” he said in the NU podcast. After the SM Group took control, the original owners had to take a back seat. Not being an academic, Hans said his contribution to NU was to set the vision and the stategy. The academic side was delegated to now NU president and CEO Dr. Renato “RJ” Carlos Ermita Jr., who holds a doctorate in educational leadership and management from DLSU, Hans’ alma mater. “In terms of the academe, it’s RJ who is the one behind those things. I don’t try to be somebody I’m not, so I get the right guys,” Hans said. “Business-wise, we control the cost and other things, academe-wise, he (RJ) takes charge of it.” When the SM Group took over, the plan was to have 100,000 students by 2027, and it’s on track to meet that goal. Ermita said the goal is to make NU “truly national” by reaching out to more students. After determining NU’s main goals, Hans also laid out three key principles: stay focused on the goals and targets, and stay hungry in achieving the goals. “When you have both, there’s a good chance you will succeed,” he said, before adding the third principle, “And when you succeed, stay humble.” NU leveraged on the growth of SM Supermalls for its expansion. Hans said SM could have just donated money to fund more scholarships via its SM Foundation, but they decided on reaching out to more students by physically expanding the school. Take the case of the P2.3-billion redevelopment of SM City Iloilo, expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2026. The expansion of the mall includes construction of 23,670 square meters for the NU Iloilo campus, set to open in 2027. “As SM grows, NU grows as well, especially in the malls where we’re contributing to turning the mall into a community,” said Ermita in the NU podcast. “A school is an important component of any community. So the identity of the mall is also changing, it becomes younger, becomes vibrant. So the whole mall is like a campus of NU, in a sense, because you see our students being seen all over the mall.” For students, there are also advantages in having a school that is part of a mall. “Being within SM complexes gives our students immediate access to essential services like public transport, bookstores, and dining areas…,” said Ermita in an SM Investments Corporation November 17 press release. In line with Henry Sy’s wish to reach out to more students, NU follows SM’s affordable pricing policy which has contributed to SM’s overall success in retail. “Typical SM. It’s not the margin, it’s the volume,” Hans said in the podcast. He said this was the same tack taken by SM when it expanded its malls, especially outside Metro Manila. “I remember, when we started to go out of Manila, my father’s order was I want same price in all areas….,” he recalled his father telling him. “Just run it [NU] like a business, just make sure it’s affordable with quality.” The NU is among the most affordable among private non-sectarian schools with an average of P80,000 tuition per academic year. If compared to a June 2024 listing of tuition in select schools by personal finance platform MoneyMax, this is lower than DLSU’s average of around P205,000-P225,000 per year, and the Ateneo de Manila University’s average of P160,000-P180,000 per year. UP, of course, is the lowest among UAAP schools due to the free college education law. “We did a balancing act. RJ was able to maintain the quality. How to ensure the quality is there, he has increased the organization. With the support of management, we’ve upgraded the salaries of faculty without really increasing much the tuition,” said Hans. Included in the pricing strategy is to upgrade the school’s facilities without being extravagant. “If you notice the campus, there’s nothing fancy, very basic, very simple but very functional,” Hans said. The pricing policy has paid off as NU has been able to significantly increase its student population. Hans said NU is now profitable, and since the mission is to make education affordable, NU has been converted into a non-stock, non-profit institution. “This means half of the income goes to faculty development, the other half goes to school development,” he said. On the academic side, the NU made it for the first time in the latest QS or Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings 2026, a provider of analytics in the global higher education sector. The QS Rating assesses higher education institutions based on global standards, and helps students decide which university is best for them. NU was ranked 21st among Philippine universities and 185th in Southeastern Asia. NU secured a QS 3 Stars Rating overall with 5 Stars in employability, 4 Stars in teaching, 4 Stars in social impact, 4 Stars in facilities, and 4 Stars in good governance. Likewise, Ermita said NU also adopted SM’s strategy that puts a premium on customer service in its operations like the school registrar. “Because NU is part of SM, the assumption really is that number 1, we are very good in customer service, so we always challenge our people, that’s the expectation,” he said. When the SM Group took over, given the doormat reputation of the school, there was low pride in being associated with NU. That’s no longer the case. How did NU restore school pride? Hans said he used sports as a marketing tool and to shortcut the process of attracting more students to enroll in NU, given that it would take longer to achieve this academic-wise. He also stressed the relationship between the size of a school population and sports. “When we came in, it was just over 1,000 students only. How can you choose athletes with 1,000 population? Right now, it’s easy, we’re 85,000 students so it’s a lot easier to choose good athletes now,” he told his godson, basketball coach and sports analyst, Charles Tiu, in a recent BNC interview. Then-NU athletics director and veteran PBA player Joaquin “Chito” Loyzaga, in a Rappler article “Who let the NU Bulldogs out?” cited the following reasons for the success of the NU sports program: Another good hire was FEU alumna Ghicka Bernabe, who led the NU Pep Squad to seven championships in nine seasons before retiring as head coach in 2022. Before the SM Group took over in 2008, NU was in last place in the UAAP Cheerdance from 2002 to 2008. Dr. Otie Camangian, currently the NU sports and athletics director, also took note of the role played by Hans in the sports program. “He’s very hands on,” Camangian said in the BNC interview. “As much as his schedule permits…in pep rallies, he’s there; in athletes’ recognition, he’s there; in [UAAP] games, he’s there. He takes time talking to athletes, having selfies with them, very fatherly-like approach, which is very inspiring to athletes.” Today, graduating high school students, given a choice of which university to go to, no longer have just AdMU, DLSU, UST, or UP in mind but NU too. This was a goal which Loyzaga mentioned back in 2015 after NU won the men’s basketball tournament. And this is one aspect that Hans is particularly proud of. “Like what I’m doing with NU, the biggest turnaround I was able to do with NU is when I made the students proud of their school,” he said. And, there’s no stopping the SM Group from further expanding the school. It plans to have 20 NU campuses by 2028. UP currently has 17 campuses. “People tease us: do we intend to have as many campuses as SM’s (89) malls?” said Ermita. “The answer I always give is, as long as there are students in a particular area who are not served and are not given an opportunity to study well, we will try our best to be there.” Hans added: “People would now say, ‘Wow, you guys…you’ve made it already. But I say, no, we’re just starting.” At the rate the NU is expanding, it will likely be the biggest school in the whole country, not just in the UAAP. In a few years, it will be overtaking the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (with a population of 97,000). – Rappler.com",True,true,[BizSights] How SM rebuilt NU and made it the biggest school in UAAP,https://www.rappler.com/voices/rappler-blogs/bizsights-how-sm-group-rebuilt-national-university/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) further trimmed the country’s economic growth targets for the remainder of the Marcos Jr. administration as the economy continues to reel from the effects of the flood control corruption scandal. During a Malacañang press briefing on Monday, January 5, Department of Economy, Planning and Development (DEPDev) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said the P6.793-trillion 2026 national budget will be able to help grow the Philippine economy by 5% to 6%. This is lower than the DBCC’s earlier target of 6% to 7%. Balisacan also said the economy is expected to grow 5.5% to 6.5% in 2027 and 6% to 7% in 2028, lower than the DBCC’s projected 6% to 8% growth for both years. The adjustments were made during the DBCC’s meeting in December 2025. The DEPDev chief cited the effects of global trade uncertainties and the public works corruption scandal on the Philippine economy. Uncovered corruption in flood control projects caused government infrastructure spending to tumble to a 14-year low in the third quarter of 2025 as the Department of Public Works and Highways implemented stricter validation measures. Corruption concerns also tempered business and consumer confidence as Filipinos held back on purchasing durable goods. The Philippine economy grew just 4% in the third quarter, with average growth for 2025 at just 5%. Balisacan said they expect the economy to have grown just 4.8% to 5% last year. Balisacan also explained that the economy will continue to feel the effects of the diminished trust in governance this year, with growth expected to rebound in the second half. “We expect growth perhaps in the first quarter to be or at least in the first half [of 2026] to be still quite not as rosy as we would want it to be. But I think that with the improvements in the systems that we are putting in place as reflected in the budget and in the various offices, we expect to see faster growth toward the second half and the succeeding years,” the country’s chief economist explained. Balisacan said consumption spending has been the main driver of economic growth in the past few years, contributing about 75% of gross domestic product (GDP) growth. He expects consumption to rebound this year on the back of growing employment and remittances, as well as slow inflation and low interest rates. The World Bank slightly downgraded its growth forecast for the Philippines this year to 5.3% from 5.4%, while Fitch Solutions unit BMI maintained its projected growth at 5.2%. – Rappler.com",True,true,DBCC lowers 2026 to 2028 economic growth targets amid corruption fallout,https://www.rappler.com/business/dbcc-revised-economic-targets-philippines-january-2026/,Rappler
"This coming Sunday, January 22, we enter the year of the Water Rabbit. Some say it is the year of the Black Rabbit. So don’t hoard that childhood candy called White Rabbit just yet. According to Chinese Astrology, the rabbit symbolizes patience and luck. 2023 will bring qualities that may have been lacking in the previous year, such as peace and success. We expect this year to be less dramatic or tumultuous than the last Year of the Tiger. The young Baguio boy Adriel Jose Angelo Trinidad, who is acknowledged as one of only two accredited masters in the Philippines by the International Feng Shui Association, told us to think of a rabbit drinking dew on a leaf. That is how fragile and charming this year will be. If the past two years had us cowering in fear and saving our strength, now is the best time to be achieving our goals and realizing our plans. But how can we realize our plans when we cannot even afford onions? We are in the Philippines, which in the past two presidencies, seemed to have lucked out. We have been six months into the Marcos presidency and we feel like the rabbits along Session Road on Sundays expecting to be kept as pets or slaughtered as food anytime. Trinidad said that he cannot divine the feng shui of the country but he surely can do so with our president, Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., who seems to be still in a party mood like he was as a teenager. Trinidad said that indeed our luck is with the President. And this is the party pooper: It is not going to be a good year for Bongbong. “Kumbaga, if our president is in good luck, susuwertehin tayong lahat pero kung minamalas siya, it will be more difficult,” Trinidad said. (In other words, if our president is in good luck, we will all be lucky but if he’s unlucky, it will be more difficult.) Bongbong was born in the Year of the Rooster. To be more specific, he was born on Rooster Month and Rabbit Day. Trinidad said that this is not an auspicious blend this year. A rooster is in direct clash with the rabbit. And as part of the feng shui rule, if it is your birth year, it’s not definitely your year. This is called “in conflict with the Grand Duke.” So a person born on a Rabbit Day will not be lucky on a Rabbit Year. “I do not want to give too much information here, but we are in for a very hectic ride,” Trinidad said. And boy, he also has some not-good prognostication of the City of Baguio. Like BBM, our luck goes where Magalong goes. And Trinidad said that Magalong has to take care of his health this year. Magalong was born in the Year of the Rat. In Trinidad’s chart, the rat will be directly affected by “Two Penalty.” The match of a rat and a rabbit creates a punishment group, which is called “impolite punishment” in feng shui. The two will affect each other. Trinidad cautioned the mayor to take extra care of his health. But all in all, 2023 is generally a year full of romance, illicit affairs included. Trinidad said it will also be a year full of scandals. He also mentioned that this Year of the Rabbit would bring more unpredictable weather, earthquakes, and landslides. Trinidad also shared that this year will be “a year of communication and compromise.” He explained that people will have to learn to adapt, “like the yin water” to whatever the Year of the Rabbit brings. – Rappler.com",True,true,‘Communication and compromise’ in the Year of the Rabbit,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/astrology/year-of-the-rabbit-predictions-2023/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Every fur parent’s weakness are those longing eyes that watch them leave the house for work or a trip. We always want to bring them along, but are quickly replaced by worries about inconvenience or our furbaby’s comfort. But take it from these fur parents who are known for bringing their pets along on fun outdoor adventures. Traveling with your pets may take a bit of preparation, but it’s not as tricky as it seems when done right. Here are five tips for a fur-tastic trip with your furbabies! A post shared by Masha (@masha.lakwatsera) Bringing your pets along takes a bit of practice before heading off on longer trips. Start with short outings to help both you and your furbaby adjust. It’s a good way to see how they respond outside their comfort zone, where excitement or anxiety might bring out behaviors different from what you’re used to at home. Many netizens know Masha Lakwatsera as the adorable shih tzu often seen sitting in the basket of Kiara’s bike as they roam around the metro. But before these big city adventures, Kiara, more fondly known as “Masha’s yaya,” shared how she began by taking Masha on short walks around their neighborhood. “Masha grew up during the pandemic, so going outdoors became our ideal bonding activity. Back then, we’d visit the nearby park every morning or go on short road trips, and that’s when I realized how much Masha enjoys being outside,” Kiara said. Similarly, Yosef Mikaela Villamejor from North Caloocan City, owner of Peanut the aspin, also started with simple outdoor activities like picnics. They often visited wide, open spaces to see how Peanut would react to new surroundings. “As an anxious dog, she loves peaceful environments and wide open areas,” Yosef said. A post shared by Peanut 🐶 (@peanut.aspin) It’s always smart to know your pet-friendly go-tos, whether for a walk trip, a picnic, or a casual dine-in. Kiara shares that within the metro, they frequent the Ayala Triangle Gardens in Makati because it’s a spacious park where you can walk freely surrounded by greenery right in the middle of the central business district. “We especially enjoy it during car-free Sundays at Ayala Avenue where I get to have my Sunday workout while Masha just enjoys the ride. After our morning rides, we usually go to pet-friendly cafés and Solid Ground in Poblacion is one of our favorites!” Kiara told Rappler. For Yosef, pet-friendly restaurants that treat pets like customers truly make a difference. “At the mall, our go-to restaurants are Manam, Gringo, and Nanyang. We also appreciate restaurants under the Bistro Group, because aside from welcoming pets, they even offer cold water and treats for them. Small gestures like that really make pet parents feel valued,” Yosef shared. Pet owners need to learn how to read their fur babies’ reactions to stay proactive during trips. With countless adventures together — from beach days to hikes and town-hopping — Kiara always prioritizes Masha’s comfort by bringing her carrier and a portable fan. “Masha’s usually well-behaved in public places but I always monitor her reactions — when something’s stressing her out or she’s already tired. It’s really important to understand your pet’s body language,” Kiara stressed. Meanwhile, Ayanna Escanilla, fur mom to the shih tzu Dopey, who recently went viral for their Boracay trip, shared how she ensures her pet feels safe even during long travels. “Pet owners should bring their pet’s favorite toys, treats, and a familiar blanket to help them feel secure,” she advised. Despite it being Dopey’s first time flying, she proudly added, “He handled everything so well. [He was] calm, curious and happy to explore a new place with me.” A post shared by Peanut 🐶 (@peanut.aspin) Bringing your pets outdoors isn’t just about bonding. It’s also a chance for them to socialize and make new friends. Yosef does this by bringing Peanut along on marathons. “What I love most is that these activities are not only good for her physically, but also allow her to meet new ‘furiends’ along the way. Our go-to walking spots include the UP Academic Oval, Brittany Park in Neopolitan Fairview, and sometimes the Caloocan City Sports Complex,” she said. Yosef emphasized that before you consider bringing your pets along with you outside, though, it’s important to have them be fully vaccinated, not just for their safety, but for the other dogs they’ll eventually interact with. She adds that she also made sure Peanut was old enough before she began exploring the outdoors. Ayanna, meanwhile, also took care of all the travel requirements for Dopey, her emotional support animal (ESA). To bring a pet like Dopey on a domestic flight, owners must follow the airline’s specific pet policy for in-cabin travel, ensure the pet is in an airline-approved carrier, and present complete documents such as updated veterinary health and vaccine records, a Bureau of Animal Industry permit, and an ESA certificate from a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist. A post shared by Masha (@masha.lakwatsera) If there’s one thing these three pet owners share, it’s how deeply they value their fur babies as “constant companions,” “best friends,” and true members of the family. Each of them describes their relationship as one built on love and trust. Dogs, known for their loyalty, also need patience and assurance that they can depend on their humans. Earning that trust often means making small sacrifices. For Kiara, it’s mustering the courage to bike around the metro with Masha. For Yosef, it’s providing steady emotional support as Peanut slowly overcomes her fears and social anxiety — finally wagging her tail instead of keeping it tucked. And for Ayanna, it’s staying patient when Dopey gets a little jealous of other dogs. These gestures, big or small, all speak the same language of love. Our fur babies experience the world through us. With the unconditional love and happiness they give, they deserve every bit of effort for a fur-tastic trip together. – Rappler.com Trixia Policarpio is a Rappler intern studying BA Creative Writing at University of the Philippines Diliman.",True,true,Bark voyage! 5 tips for a fur-tastic travel with your dogs,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/tips-traveling-with-dogs/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — Social media used to be just a space to share updates with friends. Now, people are using it as an authority for medical advice and psychological diagnoses. With the pandemic putting a spotlight on mental health, information on the topic is now everywhere. Today, everyone has access to different resources on mental health, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But in a country where access to professional help remains limited, many of today’s youth are turning to the easier, cheaper alternative: self-diagnosing using social media. Dr. Dinah Nadera, a psychiatrist practicing public mental health and head of the mental health flagship of the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health, shared that a “diagnosis” is a medical term —something that only licensed doctors can provide. Generally, getting a diagnosis starts with a lot of history-taking and self-administered questionnaires for screening. “Many times, [by the] first encounter, you’re able to diagnose. But don’t be surprised if on the second or third encounter…new information comes up. And then, the diagnosis also evolves,” Nadera told Rappler. In clinical practice, a diagnosis is often based on a patient’s history over time, leading to a lengthy process that can lead to changing results. In her experience, many patients who come to her for a consultation have an idea about their condition based on what they’ve read and seen online. “Young people who are more politically liberal. They are more open and accepting of disabilities, so that actually increases the possibility of a self-diagnosis,” she shared, adding that the pandemic contributed to this global awareness. While this increased literacy has led more people to seek professional health, there are still those who are hindered by different factors, whether due to the stigma associated with mental health issues or the lack of social support. As a result, they turn to self-diagnosing and self-managing. For Nadera, self-management is not always appropriate management. Belle*, 21 years old, was in her second year of college when she started showing symptoms that made her concerned about her mental health. “It really became harder during a certain time in college… [like] it really felt incapacitating, the emotions I was feeling. Like, I couldn’t shake it off,” she told Rappler. One night, unable to control her crying, she started to realize that her intense emotions might be more than going through a rough patch. This was when she started to pay more attention to her mental health. Unfortunately, she did not have the facilities to seek professional help. “Nahihiya din ako sa bayad like kada consult…. I didn’t have my own money, and I didn’t want to burden my parents,” she shared. (I’m also on the fence about the cost per consultation. I didn’t have my own money, and I didn’t want to burden my parents.) Nadera offers a rate of P500 for every consultation. While cheaper than others, the waiting time for a slot can take months, and these only cater to people within UP Diliman. She said that consultations in private practice can range from P1,500 to P5,000, and even more for additional psychological tests. In Belle’s case, due to financial constraints, she turned to free resources: doing her own research. “I even used AI and stuff. I talked to like ChatGPT a lot. And then I would tell ChatGPT or Gemini my symptoms,” she shared. Social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok also opened her up to other people’s experiences, allowing her to relate them to her own and learn the terminology she could research. From what her research showed, she started to get the idea that she may have bipolar and borderline personality disorder. “I kind of just made an educated guess that I may have it. I wasn’t completely sure, but at least I knew what I may have had.” Belle knew that while her “self-diagnosis” may not be completely accurate, she could use it as a starting point for coping with her overwhelming emotions. That meant practicing being more mindful, trying to keep her emotions as leveled as possible, and doing guided meditation. While these techniques were helpful at times, she still couldn’t avoid feelings of helplessness. Having an idea of what her condition may be did not stop her from having a difficult school year and summer, one that she described as a really low point of her life. More than not being properly treated for it, Nadera shared that relying on your own research may also lead to a misdiagnosis. “The bad thing about self-diagnosis is if you are too self-aware or you have too high of mental health literacy, the ordinary psychological distress might be overinterpreted as a mental disorder,” she said. Apart from this, people who self-diagnose might focus solely on the symptoms they are currently experiencing, failing to take into account their life history and past events that could contribute to these emotions. However, while Nadera believes that self-diagnosing alone is not ideal, asking for the patient’s input when doing a consultation remains important. “For me, professionals need to be open and non-judgmental if a person comes with a self-diagnosis,” she said, emphasizing the need to take this into account and correct wrong information whenever possible. Ultimately, she believes that the online resources on mental health should lead people to become aware of the common symptoms of a mental health condition and recognize if they are experiencing it. “And because you experience these common presentations of a mental health condition, that should prompt you to get assessed,” Nadera said. It was in her third year of college when Belle learned about the Philippine General Hospital’s (PGH) free psychiatric consultations and had the chance to see a professional. When she reached out in August, she was told that she could get an appointment by October. Despite the months-long wait, it brought her a sense of relief. “I started feeling that this is not something I needed to solve on my own anymore,” Belle said. After four hours at PGH of waiting, interviewing, and testing, her doctor gave her a preliminary diagnosis that she had been waiting over a year for — it was plausible that she had bipolar and borderline personality disorder. “Iba talaga ‘yung kapag sinabi talaga sa ’yo ng doktor kaysa (It’s really a different feeling when your doctor tells you compared to) when you do your own self-research. I feel like I just opened an entire chapter of my life that I didn’t expect there would be,” Belle said. Upon her doctor’s advice, she is taking lithium, which is helping her stabilize her moods. She finds them helpful in dealing with her emotions so far, and shared the sense of security she gets in being treated by a medical doctor. While seeking professional help after self-researching remains ideal, Nadera recognized the barriers that hinder this. “Matagal ang pila sa isang mental health professional (There’s a long line for a mental health professional),” she said. As such, while access to a formal diagnosis may be a long wait, she emphasized the need for individuals to navigate reliable resources for coping that can help address the issues that bother or disable them. While the unfortunate reality is that a diagnosis is not always accessible, access to information and reliable resources for coping can be useful in attempting to deal with one’s symptoms. — Rappler.com Alyana Fabella is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the Ateneo de Manila University.",True,true,Should you self-diagnose mental health problems?

"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is reviewing calls to oust Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) President and General Manager Jose Arnulfo “Wick” Veloso over alleged gross mismanagement of government workers’ pension fund, Malacañang said. Presidential Communications Office (PCO) Undersecretary Claire Castro said in a briefing on Monday, October 20, that Marcos expected agency heads to demonstrate proper leadership and would not hesitate to act on the controversies surrounding the GSIS chief. “Hindi naman po agad-agad nabibigla dahil kung mayroon pong mga reklamo sa ngayon, dapat po itong inaaral nang masinsinan (The President can’t just act on these complaints on a whim because these should be thoroughly reviewed),” Castro said. Malacañang’s remarks come after past and present GSIS officials urged Veloso to resign for the alleged mismanagement of the social security fund for GSIS members, which supposedly resulted in P8.8 billion in investment losses. According to the group’s letter to Veloso dated October 14, Veloso has exhibited a pattern of actions that were seemingly designed to bypass the proper governance of the investment fund. This includes splitting investment transactions to circumvent the need for the GSIS Board’s approval. “Your actions have fundamentally undermined the integrity and collegiality of the Board. Rather than engaging in professional discourse, you have resorted to fabricating issues and weaponizing administrative procedures to retaliate against members exercising their fiduciary duty of oversight,” they wrote. The six individuals, including four incumbent members of the GSIS Board, flagged investments in companies such as Eusebio Tanco’s DigiPlus Interactive Corporation, Enrique Razon’s Bloomberry Resorts Corporation, and Alternergy Holdings Corporation. The Ombudsman previously placed Veloso under preventive suspension over the P1.45-billion investment into Alternergy, but this was lifted in September. Veloso has since vowed to dispose of GSIS’ stake in DigiPlus and Alternergy once the market improves. As of 1:46 pm on Monday trade, Alternergy share prices were flat at P0.88 apiece, while DigiPlus shares were 0.22% higher at P23 apiece. In a statement on Friday, October 17, Veloso said he will not step down as he serves at the pleasure of the President. He insisted that claims over investment losses were baseless and that the state workers’ pension fund has outperformed its targets for the year. “As of August 2025, GSIS’s total assets have climbed to P1.92 trillion, net income has reached P100.02 billion, and total income stands at P231.06 billion. These results clearly demonstrate that, despite market headwinds, GSIS remains financially strong, resilient, and highly profitable,” Veloso wrote. – Rappler.com",True,true,Marcos reviewing calls to sack GSIS chief Veloso,https://www.rappler.com/business/marcos-jr-reviews-calls-ouster-gsis-president-wick-veloso/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Unemployment dropped to 4.4% in November 2025 amid seasonal employment during the holidays, the Philippine Statistics Authority reported on Wednesday, January 7. The latest jobless rate is equivalent to 2.25 million Filipinos, lower than the 5% or 2.54 million jobless Filipinos recorded in October but higher than the 3.2% or 1.66 million unemployed Filipinos logged in November 2024. Meanwhile, underemployment also eased to 10.4% or 5.11 million Filipinos from 12% or 5.81 million underemployed Filipinos recorded in October 2025. National Statistician Dennis Mapa said the public administration and defense sector and the education sector added the most jobs year-on-year, employing around 185,000 and 176,000 more workers, respectively. But the accommodation and food services sector as well as the wholesale and retail trade sector shed the most jobs as the economy grappled with the impact of Typhoon Tino (Kalmaegi) and Super Typhoon Uwan (Fung-wong) in November. Mapa said restaurants (-191,000), short-term accommodations (-76,000), and event catering (-23,000) shed the most jobs. “Ang reading namin is that because of these [tropical cyclones], nagkaroon ng slowdown in economic activities related to tourism, doon sa accommodation services at of course, ‘yung retail trade,” he explained. (Our reading is that there was a slowdown in economic activities related to tourism because of these tropical cyclones, particularly in accommodation services and of course, retail trade.) The Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) also estimated that Tino and Uwan affected some 873,000 workers. Mapa further noted that the agriculture and forestry sector has lost 517,000 jobs since October. “Employment in the agricultural sector has always been sensitive to weather conditions,” he said in Filipino. Despite disruptions in the construction sector due to the flood control scandal, Mapa said they did not see a correlation between the ongoing corruption probe and job losses. In fact, the construction sector added around 143,000 jobs between October and November. To minimize business disruptions, DEPDev Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said the government will support businesses in crafting continuity and resiliency plans. He added that DEPDev is pushing for the full implementation of the Philippine Innovation Act to help develop more entrepreneurs and boost job demand. The country’s chief economist also said the government is prioritizing investments in skills development and lifelong learning to empower workers and allow them to weather economic shocks. Data from online job portal Jobstreet by SEEK found that candidates from call centers and customer service were the most active jobseekers on the platform, but administrative and office support roles were the most in-demand roles being recruited for. Meanwhile, jobseekers were on the lookout for jobs in engineering and education. “Strengthening workforce competitiveness is one of the key elements to attract investments that generate quality jobs,” Balisacan said. – with reports from Arriane dela Cruz/Rappler.com Arriane dela Cruz is a Rappler intern.

"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Gregorio Brillantes, who died last Friday, September 26 at 92, has been described as a “Catholic writer.“ In fact, my friend and former colleague Juaniyo Arcellana described him as the country’s “most Catholic of writers” as he affirmed what many of us who admired Greg believed: he should have been named National Artist for Literature decades ago. “For a country that prides itself with being the last bastion of Catholicism in Asia, it’s a mystery why the prime literary prize has not been bestowed on its most Catholic of writers,” Juaniyo wrote last year when The Collected Stories of Gregorio C. Brillantes came out. What does it mean to be a “Catholic writer?” (READ: [The Wide Shot] We cannot put God in a Catholic box) Another friend Melanie Manlogon Victoriano — Melanie, Juaniyo and I worked at Midweek, edited by another legendary writer, Pete Lacaba — recalled how Greg gave her and other colleagues “a bundle of religious, philosophical and books.” One of them was What Is God Like? written “by a Jesuit — one of the best books on the subject,” Greg wrote in the dedication. “Best wishes in this life and hereafter,” he added. “How very Greg,” Melanie said in a chat after we both found out about Greg’s death. She raised a point about Greg’s identity as a Catholic writer that I agreed with: “But I don’t think he proselytized in his work — ‘di ba (isn’t it)?” Greg once wrote a feature about Saint Bernadette Soubirous for Midweek, Melanie recalled. I got the sense that being a Catholic writer for Greg also meant exploring Catholic themes focused on compassion, empathy, and social justice. Greg wouldn’t be considered a political writer. But his work took on and engaged with political and social realities of his time. In many ways, his political insights were deeper and more compelling than those of writers who were more openly political and partisan. “The Flood in Tarlac” is about feudal violence. “The Apollo Centennial,“ set in 2069, features high-tech weapons and flying saucers. But it’s not just another science fiction story. The story explored a scary future based on a fear many of us had in the 1980s: that the Marcos dictatorship would last forever. I first met Greg at a political event at the height of the Marcos regime. I was still a UP student and he was freelancing when we both covered the infamous 1982 trial of the WE Forum staff led by Joe Burgos. We met again four years later when I joined the staff of Midweek, where he and Pete Lacaba were the main editors. Greg was an excellent editor, the best I ever worked with. Melanie and I agreed on why: he would make changes in your story in a way that only made what you wanted to say in the first place — better, clearer, stronger. This was before the web and Google Docs. Greg did his edits on printed copies of our stories. He usually did it with a red pen so it sometimes looked like he would cause our copy to bleed. But I learned a lot from that process. I kept some of the printed copies of my stories that he marked to review the changes he made and to be reminded of what he taught me about good writing. “I was always thankful that I had him and Pete edit my work,” Melanie said. We agreed on another point: Greg also worked with a writer with respect. Respect for the writer and respect for the writer’s work. “Not heavy-handed editing so you feel sa iyo pa rin (it’s still yours),” Melanie recalled. “I remember how he just quietly edited our manuscripts. ‘Di siya nagmumura (He didn’t curse) if the copy was bad.” But there was a way to tell if he wasn’t exactly thrilled about the writing, she recalled. “He would move his pursed lips from side to side — I think these were times when he found issues with the text.” Greg was the oldest member of our staff. Some called him Mang (Mr.) Greg. But many of us just called him Greg. It just didn’t feel right to call him kuya (brother) or tito (uncle; male elder). He was more of a pare (buddy) — Pareng Greg. He was a colleague and a friend who enjoyed joining our inuman or our drinking sessions. (READ: Pare, boss, dear and Pinoy culture) Although he was the most distinguished member of our team, Greg was not one to hold court during our get-togethers. He would quietly sip his San Miguels and enjoy sisig (crispy pork dish) and panga ng barile (grilled tuna jaw), share his own stories and laugh at our jokes. Our favorite hangout back then was Davao Inihaw on Tomas Morato Avenue in Quezon City. Greg simply enjoyed being around friends. “He was fun to be with,” Melanie said. “He was not boisterous and didn’t joke like Nick Joaquin — iyong bumabangka ika nga — but he was fun.” In 1990, Melanie invited our staff to the baptism party for her oldest son at their house in Quezon City. Greg was the only one who showed up. “I was really surprised that he made it a point to come. He was game, chatting with Collegian (the UP student newspaper) and college barkada (friends) who were then ‘young’ and ‘aspiring’ writers compared to someone of his stature then.” A post shared by Ateneo University Press (@ateneopress) With his passing, it’s certainly time to advocate once again for Greg to be named National Artist for Literature. It’s long overdue. Ateneo Press did the country a great favor last year by publishing The Collected Stories of Gregorio C. Brillantes. I was hoping to read a new foreword by Greg, but he may have been already be too frail to write one. He did write a foreword for his first short story collection, The Distance to Andromeda and Other Stories, published in 1960. A post shared by Exploding Galaxies (@exploding_galaxies) I remember how surprised and even amused he was that I had found and bought a copy in 1987. I asked him to sign it, of course. It’s still one of my prized possessions today even though I get a kick out of Greg’s apparent image of me as some sort of rabble-rousing radical kid. He dedicated my copy to a “progressive journalist and ideologue who bridges the distances between manifestos and multitudes. Write/Right ON!” He did not immediately hand the book back to me after signing it. Instead, he reread the preface which looked back on his journey as a writer at the time the collection was published. “Why do you write?” the essay began. Greg recalled the question asked by a colegiala (school girl) named Ditas at a party. He was then in his teens and just starting his writing career. He later found out that the girl had died and he somehow found himself reflecting on that encounter and her question on why he wrote. “These stories which are now to me both familiar and strange like old friends whom one has not seen for a long time… A good record of a young man’s passage through a particular time when girls like Ditas were 18 asking their sudden questions amid the music and the voices, unmindful of the dark outside the indiscriminate and implacable future.” He was in his 30s when he wrote that essay, in his mid-50s when he reread it when I asked him to sign the book. Before returning the book to me, Greg scribbled another note at the end of the preface: “How true! How true!” “Nalulungkot naman ako (I am saddened),” Melanie said. “I should offer mass for him.” Referring to the book Greg gave her, she said, “Now, he will know for himself what God is like.” Paalam at salamat (Farewell and thank you), Pareng Greg.

"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s brother-in-law Gregorio Araneta III has sold his stake in losing gaming firm PhilWeb Corporation (PhilWeb) for P1.8 billion. In a disclosure on Thursday, October 9, Araneta, chairman and CEO of PhilWeb, said PhilWeb’s shares owned by Gregorio Araneta Incorporated (GAINC) were sold to Nexora Holdings Incorporated (Nexora) and Velora Holdings Incorporated (Velora) on Wednesday, October 8. GAINC’s shareholding (829 million issued and outstanding common shares), representing 57% of PhilWeb, were sold for P2.17 per share. Two of the declared buyers of the shares — Edgar Brian Ng and Crisanto Alcid — are long-time officers of PhilWeb. Ng, president/chairman/director of Nexora, is the current president and a director PhilWeb. Alcid, PhilWeb vice chairman and a director of PhilWeb, is director and treasuer of Nexora. Alcid is also president and COO of Greggy’s real estate firm, Araneta Properties, and an officer in other firms of the Araneta Group. Not much is known about the other buyer, Velora, but it appears to be a company that may be looking to invest in gaming in the Philippines. In its disclosure, PhilWeb said the “completion of the transaction may result in and increase in the corporation’s foreign ownership levels from 4.90% to 40%.” As required by the Securities Regulation Code on acquisitions that involve control of more than 35% of the outstanding voting shares of a public company, the buyers are required to make a mandatory tender offer to all remaining shareholders of PhilWeb. Araneta bought 53% of the stake of tycoon Roberto Ongpin in PhilWeb for P2 billion in October 2016 after then-president Rodrigo Duterte identified Ongpin as one of the “oligarchs” he wanted to take down. (READ: Ongpin sells PhilWeb shares to Greggy Araneta) Under Ongpin, PhilWeb couldn’t get its gaming license renewed by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) during the Duterte administration, which resulted in the closure of PhilWeb’s 286 e-Games cafés in August 2016. Araneta turned out to be the white knight for PhilWeb as it eventually got its gaming license renewed under his leadership. PhilWeb’s e-Games stations were back in business by December 2017. As of end 2024, PhilWeb had 100 e-Games Stations offering various casino games such as electronic Blackjack and video poker. It also operated 21 Easy e-Bingo sites. However, as more Filipino gamblers shifted to online gaming instead of playing in physical stations, PhilWeb has not been able to compete with emerging players in the e-gaming sector such as tycoon Eusebio Tanco’s DigiPlus Interactive Corporation. PhilWeb’s price per share fell from P4.12 in March 2020 to P2.08 in December 2024. It had a net loss of P599 million for year 2024, P527 million higher than its P7.8 million net loss in 2023. Revenues in 2024 was P774 million or P41.4 million lower than its P816.1 million topline in 2023. “The decrease in revenue is mainly attributable to site closures from tighter responsible gaming ordinances from certain local government units and the competition from the expansion of large integrated casinos into the company’s gaming venue markets, as well as the proliferation of PIGO (Philippine Inland Gaming Operator) service providers [which] have also affected revenues,” according to PhilWeb’s 2024 annual report. PhilWeb also had a capital deficiency of P43.9 million as of end 2024, which prompted its independent auditor Reyes Tacandong & Co. to say that this was “an indication that a material uncertainty exist that may cast doubt on the ability of the [PhilWeb] Group to continue as a going concern.” Gaming provider PlayTime, which is behind online casino app PlayTime, is reportedly interested in acquiring PhilWeb, although PhilWeb said there were no discussions with PlayTime as of September 19. PlayTime’s endorsers are popular comedian Vic Sotto and actress Heaven Peralejo. Greggy is married to the President’s sister, Irene Romualdez Marcos.

"Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer, Lately, I can’t help asking myself, “Why get married at all?” My thoughts on this stem heavily on my own experiences. I’ve had an ex who is curt, demanding, and brutally disrespectful to me. I’ve had another one that is basically loyal to her emotions and can’t regulate her emotions and heal her wounds that eventually ended up becoming my own trauma! I’ve been hurt a lot by my past relationships. And even getting to know girls online is not any better. So basically, I’ve had red flag after red flag that has been destroying my peace for the past 10 years. Maybe I have rotten luck with women? Maybe I’m not looking in the right places for the good-natured ones? So my experience is telling me: “It’s not worth the risk pursuing another one. I can cut my losses and stop here.” And with all the content of male advocates online (I’ll link three videos here) that I think should sum up what it’s like for men nowadays. If this is the norm for women in general, I think I’m better off just getting a dog. I’m not opposed to getting into a relationship with a loving, mature, caring woman (who is probably a mythical creature in terms of rarity at this point to me). But I’ve accepted that the chances of that happening are very slim. Maybe I have more chances of winning the lottery! – Tony Dear Tony, Thank you for your email. You describe your experiences with women over the last 10 years as having been a mixture of hurt, wounding, red flags and bad luck. As a result, you now feel like cutting your losses and giving up looking for marriage. You have become weary of the game and pessimistic about the future, at least when it comes to women. Perhaps it is time to take a closer look at your current view of life. Yes, you have had some bad experiences but to condemn all women based on a relative handful of relationships that went sour does seem a somewhat excessive reaction. The women you have known do not represent all women, just as you do not represent all men. In addition, you seem to be trying to justify your decision by recourse to videos that, far from presenting a balanced view, actually profit from expressing extreme views and encouraging an adversarial approach to life. Maybe you need to recalibrate a little. Look around and you will see all types of relationships, some more successful than others, some less so. With your current attitude, are you seeing problems before they arise, building defenses, setting yourself up to fail, creating self-fulfilling prophecies? Perhaps a new approach might help. Try analyzing your past, looking for patterns of behavior that may have contributed to the demise of previous relationships. Have you been overlooking something? Are your choices of partners aligned with what you think you deserve in a relationship? What conclusions can you draw to improve your future choices? Rather than building a defensive shield around yourself and looking for affirmation on the internet (where you can find support for any and all views), learn from past mistakes and remain open to new relationships so that you can use that knowledge to good purpose. You might even consider therapy to assist you on this journey. And remember, dating can be a joy in its own right; it doesn’t have to be a marriage interview! All the best, JAF Baer Dear Tony, Thank you very much for your letter. Thank you too for asking a question that more and more Gen Z-ers seem to ask themselves. To clarify, I agree with everything Mr. Baer said above: that your selective perception (based on the three reels you shared) all support the same point which, to summarize, show women demanding too much from men. I also agree with his suggestion that perhaps you should widen your dating pool so that you meet women who do not “mistake provision for devotion” and resent it when you ask them to go 50-50 even if they make the same amount of money as you do. Yes, “loving, mature, caring” women exist and are not necessarily “mythical creatures.” But, perhaps you should behave differently to meet them: Maybe ask your good friends to suggest women you can hook up with; or no longer rely on dating apps (presuming that’s what you do because let’s face it: sometimes this is THE best way to meet potential partners — no time wasted, limitless options, seemingly honest in what they say they truly want). But such honesty requires time and effort. Without putting in the time and effort, you will not have enough “data” to reassure you that it is safe to open up to them. If you open up to them without feeling reassured that they know the real you AND like you enough to try something they may not have tried before — like split the bill 50-50 — well then, no doubt about it, being with your dog would be way more fun than being with them! At least, when Spotty wags her tail when she sees you, you know she’s not pretending… Perhaps unlike your latest date who may do so just to get you to pay their bill. The most important scenario I have saved for last: Even if you do find a lovely, mature woman whom you admire and even grow to love, you do not have to marry at all (presuming you have not given her false hope!). Some people prefer making their own decisions without having to consult anyone else; some like to have their own schedules (what time to sleep, what time to eat, which may change day to day); some want to spend their hard earned money only on what they damn well please… for such people and many others, I would agree that remaining unmarried is probably the best choice. It seems the population of people who willingly never marry is growing. It is growing more rapidly among females rather than males. Among other reasons, it is because traditionally, even if they work as many hours and receive as good a salary as their husbands, they are still expected to do most of the housework and parenting. I do not blame them for their choice, as I laud yours, dearest Tony, whatever you decide. All I wish is that you are aware of anything in your past, present, or perceived future that is unduly and affecting your choice/s.

"MANILA, Philippines — Lahi, Filipino for race, characterizes Filipino designer Rajo Laurel’s Malikhaing Pinoy: LAHI, his latest 30-piece couture collection set to debut on January 30, in Bangkok, Thailand. Laurel, alongside his collaborators Arnel Papa, Tina Maristela-Ocampo, Cholo Ayuyao, Monchét Diokno Olives, and MX Studios by Maxine Santos Tuaño, answers the question: “Who is the Filipino?” but this time on the global runway. Many Filipinos are creatives, yet the number of platforms capable of showcasing their creativity internationally is few and far between. Funding, in particular, remains a persistent hurdle. “Before, we had to find sponsors,” Laurel shared with Rappler. Most of his collections were displayed within the Philippines. His 2017 Tokyo, Japan, showcase, presented during a Philippine embassy celebration, was one of the rare instances in which his work was formally shown abroad. Therefore, the government’s partnership through the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) represents a structural shift in the local industry. In recent years, Bangkok has cemented itself as Southeast Asia’s fashion hub. Bringing LAHI to this stage not only signifies the collection as a contender within the ASEAN creative economy but also places Filipino couture in a regional market that appreciates traditional craft. “Now, the government is really putting, I guess, the money where their mouth is. And the fact that they’re bringing us all to Thailand, providing opportunities for business and exposure. It’s a start, but I think it’s a beautiful start,” Laurel said. Debuting in Thailand is more than just a thrill for the LAHI team; it’s also a way for them to observe, first hand, and connect with how their ASEAN neighbors conceptualize and create. Most importantly, it’s a way to showcase what makes Filipino craftsmanship special. Looking ahead, Laurel hopes this momentum continues. He notes that policy changes, such as tax breaks, could further strengthen the creative community. But for now, his heart is overwhelmed with gratitude for what he sees as the beginning of a long-awaited government commitment to invest in Filipino creatives. LAHI’s 30-piece collection drew inspiration from the islands of Palawan to the highlands of Cordillera — the seven looks presented at the LAHI preview encapsulate a distinct Filipino taste. Bagong Barong. A modern twist on the national costume reimagines the Barong Tagalog as a layered dimension with a masculine alampay, jute bib, and a raw silk farmer-style pants woven in Bulacan. The look is anchored by a necklace of sterling silver and Filipino jade beads accented with carved ivory feathers, designed by Tina Maristela-Ocampo, and a piña abaniko fan by Monchét Diokno Olives. The Manileña. A large Barong Tagalog made of abaca silk from Abra, set against Laurel’s doodle skirt derived from his own sketches, “symbolizing the beautiful chaotic energy that is Manila.” The sculptural headpiece is by Cholo Ayuyao, while the exaggerated black pumps are designed and crafted by Maxine Santos Tuaño. Ugnayan. An archival piece first created in 2007 for Laurel’s 25th anniversary gala. It featured a handwoven braid fashioned into a friendship bracelet, “signifying the ties that bind to our community and culture.” Datu. A paper shirt made of silk paired with ramie linen trousers, and a malong made from Tnalak woven by the Tboli. The look is accented by a tampipi clutch sourced from Benguet and a giant bead tassel created in Dumaguete. The shoes are a new iteration of the sapatilya, crafted by Maxine Santos Tuaño. Kadayawan. Built from handwoven straw sourced in Sorsogon, the cropped culottes use a jusi-inspired weaving technique in rayon and silk, crafted in the Ilocos Region. Earrings by Arnel Papa, shell ring from Celestina Maynila of Tina Maristela-Ocampo, and a tassel-trimmed fan with a bell by Casa Mercedes of Monchet Diokno Olives complete the look. The Mestiza. A modern take on the classic palda, camisa, and blusa ensemble. The look is rendered in black jusi woven and dyed in Iloilo, and the drop-waist skirt is crafted from raw silk and abaca sourced from Abra. Paradiso. Inspired by pearls and the shimmer of island shores, the look features a nude-illusion gown adorned with capiz shells sourced in Bacolod, paired with an exaggerated raffia clutch from Quiapo, Manila. The aesthetics of beauty vary across cultures, and one of the ways to understand a culture’s sense of beauty is through the eyes of its creators, such as Laurel. The message he’s announcing to the world is simple yet profound. “The story [is] that this is the Filipino beauty today, and we are beautiful. Napakaganda nating tao, napakagandang nating kultura, at napakaganda nating heritage (We are a beautiful people, we have a beautiful culture, and we have a beautiful heritage).” LAHI outrightly rejects the notion that Filipino design must align with global aesthetics to be considered world-class. Ultimately, the collection is an invitation to international audiences. “Come see and explore the Philippines through a creative lens,” Laurel said – Claire Masbad/Rappler.com Claire Masbad is a Rappler intern studying AB Communication Arts at De La Salle University.",True,true,Rajo Laurel explores Filipino identity in ‘Lahi’ couture collection,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/rajo-laurel-collection-debut-thailand-2026/,Rappler

She’s also a granddaughter of former Manila mayor Lito Atienza.

Emman had a way of making people feel seen and heard, and she wasn’t afraid to share her own journey with mental health. Her authenticity helped so many feel less alone,” Felicia wrote.

"MANILA, Philippines – Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte will remain detained at the International Criminal Court (ICC) prison in The Hague after the appeals chamber denied his appeal for an interim release. “The appeals chamber unanimously confirms the impugned decision,” said the appeals chamber on Friday, November 28. A separate set of five judges denied the appeal, putting yet another roadblock to Duterte’s attempts at freedom. Dozens of drug war victims and their relatives watched the hearing at a Church center in Manila, and clapped every time they heard the judge say the word “denied” and “rejected.” An interim release is temporary freedom given to ICC detainees if they prove that they do not possess risk factors such as evading the case, recommitting the same crimes the detainee is accused of, and jeopardizing the investigation. There are also conditions to an interim release, such as restraining from communication with the outside world in a country far from the crime scene. The pre-trial chamber denied the request early October, which Duterte elevated to the appeals chamber. “The risks could not be mitigated by the proposed conditions,” said the appeals chamber, adding that while humanitarian grounds were considered, they “were not sufficiently set out in the case at hand.” Judge Luz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza, a Peruvian jurist who heads the five-person chamber, read out the decision. Carranza had previously also ruled against Duterte in June 2023 when the appeals chamber allowed the continuation of the investigation. This appeals chamber upheld entirely the pre-trial chamber, saying that Duterte’s defense team failed to point out the errors of the earlier decision. Duterte’s lawyer, Nicholas Kaufman, wore a stoic face as Judge Carranza repeated the phrase, “the defense failed.” It was also the phrase that cued the staff of Paghilom, the drug war victims refuge center run by Magsaysay Awardee Father Flavie Villanueva. Whenever they heard the phrase, which was the most comprehensible in dense legal sentences of the decision, they clapped. Raisa, not her real name, followed suit and clapped her hands. Her 20-year-old son was killed by policemen in 2020, which means that the date does not fall within the cutoff of the ICC case. Duterte’s case covers killings only up to March 2019, which is when his withdrawal from the Court became effective. But for Raisa, to see Duterte lose his motions gives her a sense of justice. “Kahit po papaano mayroon na kaming unang hakbang na makakamit na namin. Dahil tatlong file nila, ni-reject ng korte. Ang ano namin ay masaya kami dahil alam naman naming papanigan kami dahil nasa tama kami,” she said. (At least we have this first step. The Court rejected three of those he filed. We are happy because we know the court would be on our side, because we are on the right side.) Palace Press Officer Undersecretary Claire Castro said, “The International Criminal Court has already made its decision, and the Palace respects it.” Duterte did not appear at his hearing, waiving his right to be there. “If he can waive his right to appear, can this suffice to indicate cognitive fitness? Enough for him to understand the proceedings before the court?” said Nicolene Arcaina, executive director of the Ateneo Human Rights Center, which has been assisting victims of the war on drugs. The appeals chamber’s decision is final since there is no higher court in the ICC after it. Duterte is facing three counts of crimes against humanity of murder, one count each per context, representing 49 incidents of killings, with 78 victims of the war on drugs and the mysterious Davao Death Squad. Former senator Antonio Trillanes IV, who had pushed for Duterte’s arrest said: “Ngayon na natuldukan na ‘yang interim release na ‘yan, sana ay ‘wag nang magpaasa ang leaders ng Duterte camp sa mga supporters nila. Di na makakalaya si Duterte bilang kabayaran sa libu-libong Pilipinong pinapatay niya.” (Now that the interim release is final, I hope the leaders of the Duterte camp stop giving their supporters false hopes. Duterte won’t be set free as payment for the thousands of Filipinos he had ordered killed.) Right now, Duterte is also appealing a major loss in the pre-trial chamber. In late October, the pre-trial chamber upheld the ICC’s jurisdiction over his case. Had he won it, Duterte would have been cleared of all charges of crimes against humanity due to lack of jurisdiction because the Philippines withdrew as a member of the ICC even before the prosecutor could start an investigation. What is urgent for the victims and the prosecution, however, is for the pre-trial chamber to decide whether Duterte is fit for trial. In a statement, International Association of Democratic Lawyers president Edre U. Olalia said, “Mr. Duterte, you are not going anywhere. You are staying where you rightfully are.” Duterte, who turned 80 years old in the Scheveningen prison, claimed through his lawyer that he has lost critical cognitive skills, and is therefore unfit for trial. The ICC has been contracting neuropsychiatry experts to determine the veracity of his claim. With that claim still up in the air, proceedings have been halted. Charges have not been confirmed, because this claim scuttled what would have been the confirmation hearing late September this year. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Duterte remains in jail, loses ICC appeal",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/icc-appeals-chamber-denies-rodrigo-duterte-interim-release/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Through the years, The Peninsula Manila in Makati has become more than just a hotel. It has witnessed Manila’s celebrations, sorrows, and milestones. From glamorous weddings in the Rigodon Ballroom to quiet afternoons over tea in the resplendent lobby, “Manila Pen,” as Filipinos call it, holds a special place in the hearts of many. The hotel, which will celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2026, has more than 300 rooms, and hosts feasts and buffets in its various dining rooms such as Old Manila, The Lobby, Spices, and Escolta. The Peninsula Manila’s The Bar was included in Forbes Travel Guide’s 2019 list of best hotel bars. The list praised its interiors, checkered flooring, and wood walls, as well as its pica-pica like the pork sisig croquetas and the Sriracha butter duck wings, and its Batangas Old Fashioned cocktail. Back then, it was the only Philippine bar to make it to the 2019 list. The hotel has not only witnessed celebrations but political upheavals as well. In 2007, an armored military vehicle stormed the hotel’s lobby during a siege and left bullet holes that are now framed by an artistic copper sculpture. During the “Manila Pen siege,” a group of soldiers, including then-senator Antonio Trillanes IV and Brigadier General Danilo Lim, took over the hotel as they demanded the ouster of then-president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. The hotel itself has served as the backdrop for several pop culture moments across generations. During the countdown to the new millennium in 2000, Asia’s Songbird Regine Velasquez performed her rendition of “Written in the Sand” along with 200 children on the roof of The Peninsula Manila. But it’s the hotel’s iconic double-winged Brutalist architecture that makes it a touted Manila landmark. It’s located at the corner of Ayala and Makati Avenue, and families and travelers alike head to take photos with the quintuple-height Christmas tree or simply soak in its timeless elegance. Its sprawling fountain display has become a cultural emblem in itself — so much so that it was even featured in anime film Detective Conan: Black Iron Submarine in 2023. Condé Nast Traveler recognized these qualities when it included The Peninsula Manila in its 2026 “Gold List” of the best hotels and resorts, highlighting its luxurious rooms, afternoon tea, and exceptional service. It was the only Metro Manila hotel to be included in the list, and stands alongside Siargao’s Nay Palad Hideaway as of the only two Filipino hotels to be named. “I feel like The Peninsula Manila belongs to my family…. Almost every Manileño I know has a story to tell about Manila Pen. Travelers are welcome too, of course…. Perhaps, what I feel is that I belong only to Manila Pen,” writes Matt Ortile in his review for Condé Nast Traveler. The Peninsula Manila continues to combine history, luxury, and personal stories, making it a place where both visitors and locals can create memories that last a lifetime. – with reports from Alfon Cabanilla/Rappler.com Alfon Cabanilla is a Rappler intern studying AB Communication at the Ateneo de Manila University.",True,true,How The Peninsula Manila became a haven for the stories of the Filipino people,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/things-to-know-the-peninsula-manila/,Rappler
"Without even realizing it, your world sometimes gradually gets smaller: less walking, fewer days in the office, cancelling on friends. Watching plans disintegrate on the chat as friends struggle to settle on a date or place for a catchup. You might start to feel a bit flat or disconnected. Subtle changes in habit and mood take hold. Could you be… lonely? It’s not a label many of us identify with easily, especially if you know you’ve got friends, or are in a happy relationship. But loneliness can happen to us all from time to time — and identifying it is the first step to fixing it. Loneliness is the distress we feel when our relationships don’t meet our needs — in quality or quantity. It’s not the same as being objectively alone (otherwise known as “social isolation”). You can feel deeply lonely even while surrounded by friends, or totally content on your own. Loneliness is subjective; many people don’t realize they’re lonely until the feeling becomes persistent. You may feel a physical coldness, emptiness or hollowness (I’ve heard it described as feeling like you are missing an organ). Some research shows social pain is experienced similarly in the brain to physical pain. Behavioral signs may include: Emotionally, you may feel: You may also feel more sensitive to rejection or criticism. But you’re not alone and you’re not broken. Loneliness is a normal response to disconnection. The late US neuroscientist John Cacioppo described loneliness as an evolutionary alarm system. In the past, being separated from your tribe meant danger and risk from predators, so our brains developed a way to push us back towards connection. The pain of loneliness is designed to keep us connected and safe. Sadly, there’s still a lot of stigma around admitting loneliness, especially for men. Many people resist identifying as lonely, or feel this marks them as a “loser.” But this silence can make the problem worse. When no one talks about it, it becomes harder to break the cycle of loneliness, and the stigma remains. While passing loneliness is normal, chronic or persistent loneliness can hurt our health. Research shows chronic loneliness is associated with: Loneliness can also become self-reinforcing. When loneliness feels normal, it can start to shape how you see the world: you expect rejection, withdraw more and the cycle deepens. The earlier you notice you’re lonely, the easier it is to break. Yes, but you can still be lonely. Most of us need different kinds of relationships to thrive. It’s not about how many people you know, but whether you feel connected and have a meaningful role in these relationships. You may feel lonely even with strong friendships if you are lacking deeper connection, shared identity or a sense of community. This doesn’t mean you’re ungrateful, or a bad friend. It just means you need more or different kinds of connection. Start by asking yourself: what kind of connection am I missing? Is it one-to-one friendships? A partner? Casual social interactions? A shared purpose or community? Then reflect on what’s helped you feel more connected in the past. For some, it’s joining a choir, a book club or a sports group. For others, it may be volunteering or just saying “yes” to small social moments, like chatting with your local barista or learning the name of the local butcher. If you’re still struggling, a psychologist can help with tailored strategies for building connection. It’s also important to remember loneliness is often not because of personal failings or overall mental health. My own research shows loneliness is often shaped by structural factors, such as poor planning in our local neighborhood environments, financial inequality, work pressures, social norms, or even long-term effects of restrictions from the COVID pandemic. We are also learning more about how climate change can disrupt social connection and worsen loneliness due to, for example, higher temperatures or bushfires. Loneliness is normal, common, human and completely solvable. Start by noticing it in yourself and reach out if you can. Let’s start talking about it more, so others can feel less alone too. – Rappler.com Marlee Bower is a senior research fellow at Matilda Centre for Research in Mental Health and Substance Use, University of Sydney.

"Tax evasion is often treated as a technical infraction — a matter of forms, loopholes, and compliance. It is not. Tax evasion is corruption. It is the deliberate theft of public resources meant to build classrooms, strengthen hospitals, finance climate resilience, and uplift communities. It enables illicit wealth, distorts public policy, and erodes trust in institutions. And it is time the world finally treated it as such. Globally, tax evasion drains an estimated US$483 billion every year, according to the Tax Justice Network. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that developing countries lose up to 6% of GDP annually, far exceeding many nations’ combined budgets for health and education. Where corruption generates illicit income, tax evasion hides it. The two crimes reinforce each other — one produces the stolen money; the other conceals it. This is why the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) must update its framework. And this is why the Philippines must lead the call. Conservative studies by the Department of Finance and the IMF estimate that the Philippines loses P700 billion to P1.3 trillion every year to tax evasion — funds that could build thousands of classrooms, upgrade hospitals, and support superior and long-term programs for transport, flood-control, and climate adaptation. Every peso stolen through corruption becomes a peso concealed through tax evasion. The public loses twice — first from the theft, then from the cover-up. 1. Launch a nationwide risk-based investigation of politically exposed persons The Department of Finance and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) must urgently conduct a nationwide, intelligence-driven investigation covering elected officials, their families, campaign donors, contractors, and individuals implicated in flood-control, pandemic procurement, and other major controversies. Mandated lifestyle checks, Statement of Assets Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) reviews, and cross-matching with property, vehicle, and offshore records must form part of an integrated anti-corruption strategy. This is not political persecution. It is good governance — long delayed and desperately needed. 2. Lift bank secrecy for tax purposes The Philippines remains one of only three countries — along with Lebanon and Switzerland — that still shields bank accounts from tax authorities. This archaic regime protects big-time evaders while imposing strict compliance on ordinary taxpayers. Lifting bank secrecy is essential to detecting illicit wealth, enforcing anti-money laundering rules, and aligning with UNCAC, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards. No honest public official has anything to fear from transparency. 3. Replace manual audit with a modern, digital, risk-based system The problem is not merely corruption inside the BIR — it is the outdated system that enables it. Manual audits enable bribery; random audits repeatedly target MSMEs; and large, well-connected taxpayers easily negotiate settlements. The Philippines must adopt a risk-based, computer-assisted audit system that leverages AI, data analytics, blockchain, third-party information, and cross-agency data to: Modern tax administrations catch tax criminals through intelligence — not harassment. 4. Hold private-sector enablers fully accountable Tax evasion is rarely committed alone. It often involves complicit accountants, contractors, brokers, and auditors who manipulate records or create sham transactions. Global frameworks — including OECD BEPS (Base erosion and profit shifting) and AML (anti-money laundering) standards — already recognize these enablers. The Philippines must do the same. 5. Use the tax code as a weapon against corruption Unexplained wealth, kickbacks, bribery, and fraudulent procurement all create taxable income. Even when graft cases stall, tax evasion charges can freeze assets, impose penalties, and permanently disqualify officials from public office. This is how the US took down organized crime. It is how countries prosecute kleptocrats. It is how the Philippines can finally end impunity. To reimagine a Philippines — and a world — without corruption, without climate change, and without poverty, we must plug the largest leak in public finance: tax evasion. The path forward is clear: No nation has ever prospered while allowing corruption to thrive. Treating tax evasion as corruption is not just good policy — it is a moral imperative.

"MANILA, Philippines – Despite its substantial impact on global trade, US President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff policy was “not mentioned” in the formal high-level meetings of ASEAN agriculture and forestry ministers held here this week. It was, instead, discussed during informal talks over lunch. “In general, the discussion on tariffs was mostly done over lunch by a simple question: ‘Have you resolved or have you closed?’” Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. told reporters on Thursday, October 2. In a luxury hotel along Manila Bay, Tiu Laurel was speaking at a press conference midway through the 47th Meeting of the ASEAN Ministers on Agriculture and Forestry (AMAF). AMAF is the highest decision-making body of the bloc on agriculture and forestry. Dialogue partners of the body in the AMAF meeting included China, Japan, and South Korea. Tiu Laurel’s “lunch” response came after he was asked the third time around about US tariffs. The Philippines’ agriculture chief said that most ministers he talked with said they still have no final tariff deals with the US. He did not name which member-states. While the issue of US tariffs was not formally discussed, Tiu Laurel said ASEAN ministers did agree on increasing trade within the region “so that we can rely on each other first rather than relying on others that are far away.” “Of course, a discussion also is to find other markets around the world for ASEAN products,” he added. Since August, Philippine goods entering the US face a 19% tariff rate. Meanwhile, US exports entering the Philippines are supposed to be tariff-free, although Philippine officials say there’s still no signed agreement. Despite what seems an uneven bargain, the Marcos administration framed talks with Trump last July a “successful achievement” when it managed a one-point decrease. Negotiations are still ongoing as the Philippines seeks exemptions to the 19% tariff rate. Asked if China is already positioning to fill the gap that a more protectionist America leaves in the wake of higher import duties, Tiu Laurel said “there was no real discussion with China” yet. China, however, “has been open in general” to Philippine durian exports and other ASEAN produce, according to Tiu Laurel.

"In a country where over six million Filipinos still lack a place to call home, “affordable housing” often translates to rows of cramped, concrete boxes built on the fringes of society. But what if businesses treated housing not as a cost or compliance issue, but as a mission, a means to restore dignity to Filipino families? At the 2025 PHINMA Policy Forum, thought leaders and changemakers from business, academe, and civil society gathered to confront this question. The conversation moved beyond mere statistics; it became a collective call to reimagine what “home” means, and how business can be a force for building it. The event’s overarching theme, “Business as a Force for Good,” challenged companies to look beyond the bottom line and toward the lives that their industries touch. Housing, after all, is not just a social issue, it is a measure of how we value our people. And as the discussions revealed, addressing it requires both heart and strategy, both compassion and commitment. As Dr. Stan Padojinog of the University of Asia and the Pacific emphasized, the housing crisis is not only about shelter but about survival. Demographic shifts, declining fertility rates, delayed household formation, and an aging population, have reshaped the country’s economic landscape. “We are aging while still poor,” he warned. Without strong investments in housing and community infrastructure, the Philippines risks growing old before it grows prosperous. Housing, Padojinog explained, is a powerful economic multiplier. It stimulates industries from construction to finance, while providing stability for families to pursue education and employment. Yet, production has fallen short for decades. The backlog, now 6.5 million homes, represents not only lost opportunities but also deepening inequality. For him, the solution lies in “management by mission,” where businesses operate not solely for profit but guided by a higher purpose. When profit is aligned with impact, both enterprise and society thrive. His point was clear: the housing deficit is not just a policy gap; it’s a mission waiting for business to embrace. As stated by PHINMA Community Housing vice president, Luis Oquiñena, the challenge goes beyond construction. “The goal is to move past the ‘pwede na’ (that’ll do) mentality,” he said, “and create a new, dignified standard for socialized housing.” His message cut through the usual policy talk, it was both an invitation and a reckoning. For too long, socialized housing has been treated as a checkbox on government agendas or a corporate social responsibility add-on. Oquiñena argues that it must instead be rooted in purpose and empathy. He described PHINMA Community Housing’s approach as one that goes beyond simply building houses. It’s about building communities, places where families can thrive, not just survive. The goal is to create neighborhoods that nurture life: homes with light and space, access to training centers, and even daycare hubs so parents can work and children can learn. He envisions a community sustained by bayanihan, where cooperation becomes a new currency and dignity a shared value. For him, it’s not just about policy or profit, but about building a movement, one that turns socialized housing into a collective act of nation-building. From the perspective of Carl Andrew Siy of the Pag-IBIG Fund, the problem is not that we lack policy frameworks, it’s that we fail to connect the dots. With programs like the expanded 4PH initiative and updated price ceilings already in place, the question now is how to execute them effectively and at scale. During the panel discussion, co-panelist and host lawyer Third Bagro posed a crucial question: “Are we in crisis mode?” The answer, perhaps, is yes, and that acknowledgment is where transformation begins. Siy highlighted that while financing mechanisms exist, accessibility and land availability remain major hurdles. There are funds that remain untapped and policies that, though well-intentioned, do not always reach the people who need them most. His insights underscored the need for better coordination among government, developers, and communities, not to reinvent the system, but to make it work as intended. In the end, the challenge is not a lack of resources, but a need for stronger collaboration and follow-through. After all the talk of policy, finance, and business models, the forum’s most powerful argument came not from an expert, but from a father. For ten years, Ruben worked as a utility man, messenger, and driver, dreaming of the day he could give his wife and child a home of their own. His testimony became the unassailable ‘why’ behind this entire mission, a reminder that the numbers we discuss represent real lives and real dreams. He spoke softly of his fears, his humble expectations, and the overwhelming emotion of seeing a home that was not just pwede na, but built with care and pride. “Simple lang ‘yung bahay (The house is just simple),” he said, holding back tears, “pero iba ‘yung dating para sa amin (but it’s impact on us is different).” His words embodied everything the forum sought to achieve: the belief that dignity must never be optional. It is the reason we must reject the status quo and demand something better. As Ruben so powerfully declared, it is time we build a nation where there are “walang squatter sa sariling bayan” — no squatter in one’s own country. That vision, born not of policy but of lived experience, must anchor the mission ahead. Building dignified housing is not charity; it is justice. It is a declaration that Filipino families deserve more than makeshift roofs and narrow rooms, they deserve spaces that reflect hope, humanity, and home. The forum ended not with finality, but with resolve. If the business sector can transform classrooms and industries, it can also transform the very concept of home. The task now is to unite, government, private sector, and citizens, under a shared promise: that progress will no longer leave anyone outside the gate. Because to build dignified homes is to build a dignified nation, one where “pwede na” is no longer enough, and where every Filipino finally belongs. – Rappler.com Madriella Denise Allison L.

"The National Transmission Corporation (TransCo) has released projected Green Energy Auction (GEA) rates for various renewable energy batches (GEA 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6) covering years 2025 to 2050. Although the table appears highly technical — with columns of CRR (Cost Recovery Rates) expressed as pesos per kilowatt-hour (₱/kWh) — it tells a simple story: renewable energy costs will rise sharply entering 2030, then gradually decline over the long term. This table (above) foretells the country’s march to the most consequential decade of its renewable-energy transition. For years, policymakers promised cheaper, cleaner power once the country ramps up green capacity. Yet, newly released projections from TransCo paint a more nuanced picture — one that rewards long-term thinking but demands brutal honesty in the near term. TransCo’s GEA-All Rate Estimate, covering Green Energy Auction rounds 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, offers a comprehensive look at how much cost consumers may shoulder to support the country’s aggressive renewable build-out from 2025 to 2050. The message is that transition will not be smooth, and renewables will not immediately translate into cheaper electricity. Costs rise materially as massive new capacities come online around 2030. Only afterwards do they settle into a long-term downward glide. For an economy still struggling with high power prices, fragile grids, and fossil-fuel volatility, understanding this curve is not optional. It is essential for everyone who relies on electricity. Between 2030 and 2033, the estimates show a pronounced increase in the CRR — the amount the system must recover per kilowatt-hour. Across all tariff scenarios, the same story emerges: GEA-5 and GEA-6 change the game. GEA-5 alone brings in 3.3 gigawatts of new renewable capacity — arguably the single largest green-energy commitment in Philippine history. But big capacity comes with big price tags: tariff assumptions hover at ₱12/kWh for GEA-5 and ₱10/kWh for GEA-6. The result? Under the standard ₱4/kWh scenario, the average GEA-All rate jumps to ₱0.6286/kWh from 2030-2033. In the more conservative ₱3/kWh scenario, it climbs to ₱0.8507/kWh. In plain English: 2030 is the year when the Philippines pays the “entry fee” for large-scale renewable energy. This spike is not a sign of market failure. It is the natural economic profile of green transitions worldwide: upfront pain for long-term payoff. Interestingly, CRR figures from 2025 to 2027 show minimal — even negative — rates. This does not suggest lower electricity bills. Instead, it reflects: These are artificial cushions. They will not survive the surge of renewable energy commitments beginning 2028 onward. The most important takeaway — the one that should guide CEOs, investors, and policymakers — is what happens after the 2030–2033 shock period. From 2034 to 2050, the CRR steadily drops across all tariff scenarios: The long-term trend is unmistakable: renewable energy becomes progressively cheaper over time, eventually outperforming fossil fuels, even after factoring in all cost recoveries. This tail-end decline is consistent with global experience. As capacity scales, technology costs fall, financing becomes cheaper, and operational efficiencies compound. In short: green energy is expensive to build but cheap to run. But the real story that separates this decade from the next is not solar, not onshore wind, and not even geothermal — it is offshore wind (OSW). Its economics, price impact, and timing will determine whether the Philippines sails smoothly into the renewable future, or locks itself prematurely into decades of elevated costs. TransCo’s projections point to a clear two-phase pattern: This is driven by the entry of GEA-5 and GEA-6, including early-stage OSW. High early tariffs — ₱10 to ₱12 per kWh — push CRR sharply upward in the early 2030s. Power-intensive industries will feel this immediately. After 2034, as renewable assets amortize and the country’s total generation capacity expands, CRR levels ease and flatten. This is where renewables outperform fossil fuels: expensive, entering the system; cheap, sustaining it. But this simple two-phase model hides a deeper and more consequential dynamic: the effect of OSW costs diluting over time as the total energy pie grows. Offshore wind is the most capital-heavy renewable technology in the pipeline. Its Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) remains significantly higher than solar, onshore wind, or even geothermal. But here’s the nuance often lost in public discourse: the cost impact of OSW decreases over time — not because OSW gets cheap, but because everything else around it grows. As solar, battery storage, onshore wind, and geothermal expand, the total generation base of the Philippines grows dramatically. The OSW cost, while still high, becomes a thinner slice of a much larger pie. That dilution effect is real, measurable, and supportive of long-term energy stability. However — and this is the key message for policymakers — the dilution does not eliminate the drag; it only distributes it. OSW will still impose a significant price impact for years. It will be a burden on the grid before it becomes a strategic advantage. And this is where the Philippines must avoid locking itself too early into massive OSW commitments. Without strategic timing, the Philippines risks repeating the early solar mistakes of other countries: committing too early at high LCOEs, only to watch prices collapse a few years later. There are three rational strategies to avoid an unnecessary price burden: Wait for the LCOE to drop significantly — just as solar photovoltaic (PV) did over the last decade. OSW is still in its expensive phase globally. Early adopters pay a premium. Instead of committing 3,300 MW upfront, begin with a few hundred megawatts.Learn from implementation, build supply-chain expertise, train the workforce, and only scale when costs materially decline. A measured hybrid: small early OSW deployments for knowledge-building, combined with postponed large-scale capacity until economics improve. The Philippines does not need 3.3 GW of OSW today. What it needs is timing, sequencing, and discipline. Another strategic question is whether OSW will remain the highest-cost renewable over the next decade. The answer is increasingly: not necessarily. The GEA framework may soon include technologies such as: Any of these technologies could compress the cost curve further. If they become viable, OSW’s relative role — and its economics — will shift dramatically. In other words: locking into 3,300 MW of OSW today may close the door to cheaper technologies tomorrow. Offshore wind will almost certainly play a major role in the Philippines’ energy future. Its scale, reliability, and capacity factor make it a strategic anchor for a mature renewable grid. But this role must be earned through timing — not forced through early commitment. OSW’s cost curve will decline. The energy pie will grow, diluting OSW’s price impact. But none of this justifies a premature 3,300 MW lock-in. The next decade is about managing cost turbulence while building the foundations of a stable, diversified renewable grid. Offshore wind is part of that future — but not at any price, and not at any pace. The discipline to sequence OSW, backload large-scale deployment, and allow the energy pie to grow first will determine whether the Philippines becomes a regional energy leader — or saddles consumers with unnecessary costs during the most economically sensitive decade in its energy transition. As new renewable capacity under GEA-5 and GEA-6 enters the grid — particularly early-stage offshore wind — the system’s CRR rises sharply. These technologies are still expensive, and early-stage OSW carries some of the highest costs in the renewable spectrum. Tariffs of ₱10-₱12 per kWh for OSW generation translate into system-wide CRR increases that will eventually filter into consumer generation charges. The spike between 2030 and 2033 will not be theoretical; it will appear in actual monthly bills. This is the transition pain that every country goes through. But the Philippines risks amplifying that pain if it mismanages OSW timing. Some policymakers argue that OSW costs will “dilute” in the future. That is true — but not for the reasons the public thinks. The cost impact of OSW declines not because OSW itself becomes cheaper, but because the total national power supply will grow. A larger energy “pie” means OSW becomes a smaller, thinner slice. Its cost remains high, but it is spread over a larger base of generation from solar, geothermal, onshore wind, and storage. Yes, OSW costs will look smaller on a pesos-per-kWh basis over time — but this dilution takes years. Meanwhile, Filipino households will shoulder the early surge. Even if diluted over time, OSW still imposes a significant price burden in its early deployment years. Consumers will pay: Filipinos already face among the highest electricity rates in Asia. Careless OSW timing can push that burden even higher. This is the price impact that households cannot afford — and one that government can still avert. Based on my talks with well-placed friends in the energy sector, if the Philippines wants OSW to succeed without punishing the public, it must change its sequencing. 1. Postpone large-scale OSW until costs fall significantly. Offshore wind today is where solar PV was 15 years ago — expensive, immature, and volatile in cost. Waiting could cut future LCOE by 40-60%, based on global trendlines. 2. Start small instead of committing 3,300 MW immediately. A few hundred megawatts of OSW — pilots — would allow the country to learn: Small-scale today shields consumers from large-scale price shocks. 3. Use a blended strategy. Deploy minimal OSW first, delay the rest until the economics are better. This approach protects consumers while keeping the country on the OSW roadmap. The best transitions are not those done fastest, but those done smartest. Another overlooked factor is competition. The GEA mechanism may later support emerging technologies: If the Philippines locks into 3,300 MW of expensive OSW too early, consumers will lose the chance to benefit from future technologies that could be far cheaper. It would be the ultimate irony: Filipinos end up paying high prices for outdated technology because government committed too early. Offshore wind will eventually play a major role in stabilizing the Philippine grid. It provides scale, reliability, and baseload-like characteristics. But these advantages only materialize when OSW becomes cost-competitive. The public should not be forced to subsidize the learning curve of a technology that is not yet financially mature, especially when cheaper alternatives exist today. If the government gets the timing right: If it locks into OSW too early: In this transition, timing is everything. And the Filipino public — already burdened by one of the priciest power markets in Asia — simply cannot just afford this. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] Why the Philippines should slow down on offshore wind transition,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-why-philippines-should-slow-down-offshore-wind-energy-transition/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — Filipino chef Nouel Catis, the man behind the Dubai chocolate pistachio bar that continues to circulate on social media, keeps reshaping his creation, but now in different forms through Philippine brands. Catis spent his childhood selling his mother’s baked goods at school in Dipolog. He later took up Hospitality Management at UP Diliman, a path that opened the door to hotel work and further studies in pastry at the French Culinary Institute. In 2009, the Filipino chef moved to Dubai, a decision that allowed him to explore the culinary world and work at Burj Al Arab, a luxury hotel that helped him establish himself in the industry. His rise began in 2021 when he introduced the Dubai knafeh with FIX Dessert Chocolatier, which is originally a Middle Eastern dessert. Today, he leads his own brand, SNA’AP, where he still sells his famous chocolate bar while reinterpreting new flavors such as Manila Ube Baklava and Fukuoka Strawberry. This year, Catis came back to the Philippines and has been collaborating with local brands, with each exploring the essence of his chocolate bar creations into new dessert forms. His dessert creations draw from nostalgia and childhood memories. In an interview, the chef joked that collaborating with local brands gave him an excuse to keep flying home, but he later explained that his real intention was to honor his Filipino heritage. “Making the products accessible to the whole country — it’s a way for me to travel to the Philippines without traveling. So I just want to return the favor to the community, to the Filipinos, that when I’m done overseas, I also want you guys to try it here in the Philippines,” said Catis. His first-ever local collaboration was with Amado Forés’ restaurant group AF Hospitality, where he hit three restaurants with one dessert concept. This collaboration saw a mano serving a Dubai Chocolate Soft Serve, Ramen Ron offering a Dubai Chocolate Mochi, and Steak & Frice creating a Dubai Chocolate Crepe. The limited collaboration from April to June included a “Dessert Passport” quest where customers collected stamps for each dessert creation they tried. Completing all desserts from the three restaurants earned them Catis’ SNA’AP signature chocolate bar. To give back to Filipinos, the partnership became even more meaningful as the chocolate bar inventor shared that part of the proceeds went to MAD Travel’s AgroForestry Program supporting Dumagat cacao farmers. From chocolate bars to Filipino scoops, Catis’ collaboration with Marcelo’s Microcreamery debuted at ICEGEX 2025. The ice cream collection features flavors inspired by the chef’s chocolate bars: Pistachio Kunafa Chocolate, Ube Baklava, and Strawberry Fields. Each pint costs P469 and is available at The Marketplace, with wider distribution coming soon to Robinsons and Shopwise. Marcelo’s Microcreamery is a local ice cream brand known for putting a local, unique twist on their flavors, with their Pinoy-inspired combinations instead of the classic ice cream flavors. They have their previous lineup of creative flavors such as Latik-Latik, Bilo-Bilo, Manga’t Suman, Chocolate Champorado, Ube Macapuno Champorado, and Inutak. Catis recently entered a long-term partnership with Auro Chocolate, an award-winning Davao-based chocolatier that sources directly from Filipino farmers. Auro is now manufacturing the SNA’AP chocolate bars, including an exclusive ube baklava variant with Auro Chocolate’s 42% milk chocolate. SNA’AP’s first creation and signature Dubai Chocolate bar also uses the same milk chocolate filled with pistachio and kunafa, with Auro helping refine the recipe. The bars come in a compact, square box. Each bar costs P575, while the Manila + Dubai Chocolate gift costs P1,150. They’re available at Kultura stores, Auro Cafés, and online through Auro’s official website and Lazada. From the Filipino word kakaiba (different) and Arabic word khaiba (surprise), Khaiba presented blends of Filipino nostalgia with Middle Eastern influences. Khaiba was the Balmori pop-up dining concept developed to bring together chef Sonny Mariano and Catis. Mariano led the savory side, presenting Filipino dishes with Mediterranean touches, while Catis crafted desserts with his signature Dubai-inspired flavors. The menu paired Mariano’s 12 savory creations with Catis’ desserts including Habibi, I’ve Come from Dubai, a chocolate cake with pistachio and Davao chocolate frosting; Habibi Cake, a chocolate cake inspired by his signature chocolate; and Honey, Mangga, Please, a mango cake consisting of coconut cream, graham crumble, and caramelized cashews. Catis also presented a halo-halo dessert built around ube cheesecake and pandan-evaporada milk and Dubai Chocolate Profiteroleros with pistachio-kunafa crunch and Milo sauce. Khaiba was presented at The Balmori Suites Chef’s Table, Powerplant Mall in Makati from June to July. Catis’ latest collaboration is with Krispy Kreme, where he reimagined his viral chocolate into a beignet-style doughnut and drink, bringing the flavors of Dubai, Manila, and Japan into one collection. “I want them to feel like they’re traveling to Dubai, taking a stopover and back in Manila, then going to Japan again and back to the Philippines. So I just want you to feel the different flavors and also how craftsmanship can make you happy,” he said during the launch. He also shared that he previously worked at a donut company that gave him prior experience in crafting pastries. The doughnut trio includes the Dubai Pistachio Kunafa, a pistachio kunafa with a pistachio-kataifi edge; the Manila Ube Baklava, filled with ube baklava cream and topped with cashew-kataifi; and the Fukuoka Strawberry Fields, filled with cheesecake and strawberry with Biscoff crumbs. The drink offering is the Dubai Pistachio Iced Mocha Latte that’s made with pistachio nuts and kataifi. The doughnut price starts at P200, while the latte starts at P270. Catis also revealed that some ingredients are sourced locally. He shared, “We’re combining different supplies of these ingredients to help the local industry. We are rolling ingredients that are also sourced locally.” The collection was released this November and will be available until December 31 at Krispy Kreme physical stores and via delivery. Another recent local project he took part in was the pop-up collaboration introducing Miele Innovation Series with Miele. Miele, a German manufacturer of home appliances, partnered with the chef to create a dessert line, blending German tradition with Filipino influences. The lineup includes The Green Forest, Catis’ take on the Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte (black forest cake), which is a transformation of his signature chocolate into a pastry, as it includes his original pistachio-kunafa spread. The Miele Honey Cake draws inspiration from classic Apfelstrudel (apple strudel) and Bienenstich (bee sting cake), combining Catis’ Filipino heritage and Miele’s German tradition, while retaining the company’s signature honeycomb design. Lastly, the Barako-Dalandan Torte is a tart that showcases the chef’s expertise beyond the chocolate, applying his years of experience with Middle Eastern techniques. The tart comprises hazelnut shortcrust pastry, Barako ganache, and toffee-dalandan caramel. The Miele Innovation Series launched last October. The pop-up is open to the public at the Miele Flagship Showroom in McKinley, BGC until November 24. Matcha lovers also get to experience Catis’ creativity with his collaboration with The Matcha Tokyo. The collection includes a Matcha Butter Mochi infused with pistachio kunafa for P290 and Dubai Chocolate cookie with Matcha Soft Serve for P550. There’s also the Habibi Matcha Cake, a chocolate cake with a matcha twist priced at P420 per slice and P1,200 for the whole cake. The drink lineup also connects Dubai’s innovative dessert and Japan’s traditional tastes, featuring the Matcha Dubai Chocolate Latte for P395 and Hojichai with Langue de Chat for P295. These food and beverages are available in The Matcha Tokyo’s branches, like Opus Mall, Ayala Vertis North, Robinsons Magnolia, Lucky Chinatown, SM Mall of Asia, SM Fairview, Parwal Mall, SM Clark, and Mitsukoshi BGC. – Alessandria Corral/Rappler.com Alessandria Corral is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Speech Communication at the University of the Philippines Diliman.",True,true,Chef Nouel Catis turns viral Dubai chocolate into local collabs,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/chef-nouel-catis-viral-dubai-chocolate-local-collabs/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a show cause order to the appraiser that valued properties of tycoon and former senator Manny Villar’s Villar Land Holdings at over P1 trillion. In a letter dated September 29, the SEC’s Office of the General Accountant ordered E-Value Philippines Incorporated to explain why it should not be penalized for its P1.34-trillion valuation of the firm’s Villar City development in Metro Manila and Cavite. The show cause order is part of the corporate watchdog’s ongoing investigation into Villar Land’s 2024 financial statements, which the company failed to submit before the deadline. The SEC earlier fined Villar Land P12 million for the late submission of its financial reports, and P2,000 for each day it failed to submit its audited earnings reports for 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. “The SEC will continue to investigate this matter thoroughly in the interest of upholding transparency and accountability in valuation practices and accuracy in financial reporting,” the corporate regulator said in a statement on Tuesday, October 7. Despite Villar Land’s failure to file its financial reports on time, the SEC noted that the company authorized the release of its unaudited financial statements to the Philippine Stock Exchange in a board resolution dated March 28. Two of Manny’s children, Senator Mark Villar and Senator Camille Villar, currently hold seats on Villar Land’s board of directors. (READ: For the Villars, everything is a family business) According to the board resolution, Villar Land posted a whopping P999 billion in profits in 2024 due to fair value gains from the revaluation of properties it acquired from three other Villar-owned firms in September 2024. E-Value completed its initial valuation of the parcels of land within Villar City with the following figures: However, Villar Land said the release of its 2024 audited financial statements was delayed after its external auditor, Punongbayan & Araullo (P&A), did not accept E-Value’s valuation of the land. To meet the previous submission deadline, Villar Land and P&A agreed to value the properties at cost basis, or the cost Villar Land paid to acquire the properties. This amounts to just P8.6 billion. “We want to highlight that while the company believes that it is the fair value of the Villar City properties that should be reflected in its financial statements, in the interest of securing the immediate release of the 2024 audited financial statements, it reluctantly proposed to the external auditors the use of cost basis in recording its said properties,” the Villars’ property firm said in an earlier statement. Minus the fair value gains from E-Value’s valuation, Villar Land’s operating profit — the income it made from its usual business activities — dropped 29% to P1.22 billion. The reported surge in Villar Land’s profits also caused a jump in Manny Villar’s net worth to $17.2 billion as of April, making him the richest Filipino according to Forbes. – Rappler.com",True,true,SEC to appraiser: Explain Villar Land’s P1.34-trillion valuation,https://www.rappler.com/business/sec-show-cause-order-evalue-philippines-villar-land-valuation/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Detained mining tycoon Joseph Sy, who is facing deportation charges for supposedly falsifying his Filipino citizenship, has resigned as director of nickel exporting firm Global Ferronickel Holdings Incorporated (FNI), effective immediately, the company disclosed on Friday, December 26. “His decision was due to personal considerations and for the best interests of the company. The company expresses its appreciation for Mr. Sy’s service and contributions during his tenure,” publicly listed FNI told the Philippine Stock Exchange. The Bureau of Immigration said Sy has the same fingerprints as Chinese citizen Chen Zhong Zhen. He was arrested at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport on August 21 for allegedly misrepresenting himself as a Filipino citizen. He is currently being held at the BI’s detention facility in Taguig City while his case is on appeal. Sy’s resignation was announced 11 days after an embarrassing appearance before the Senate justice and human rights subcommittee chaired by Senator Risa Hontiveros, where he dodged questions about his citizenship due to his pending legal case. When asked by Hontiveros basic questions of where he was born and where he grew up, Sy repeatedly said, “I can invoke my right to remain silent.” “Humarap nga sa Senado ang mining businessman na si Joseph Sy, pero wala namang maayos na sagot! Lumaki din ba siya sa farm? Mining tycoon na nagpapanggap umano na Pilipino? Another Alice Guo na naman ba ito?” Hontiveros said after the hearing, referring to the dismissed mayor of Bamban, Tarlac, who was found guilty by a Pasig City court in November for human trafficking. (Mining businessman Joseph Sy faced the Senate but failed to give good answers. Did he also grow up on a farm? A mining tycoon allegedly pretending to be a Filipino? Is this another Alice Guo?) “Ang tanong ngayon: paano siya naging Pilipino? Bakit may Chinese citizen na may kapareho niyang fingerprints? Was his identity lawfully obtained or manufactured for special access? Hindi na sapat ang palusot. The abuse of our laws and our systems must end.” (The question now is: how did he become a Filipino citizen? Why does he have the same fingerprints as a Chinese citizen? Was his identity lawfully obtained or manufactured for special access? Excuses are not enough. The abuse of our laws and our systems must end.) A Taguig City court and the Court of Appeals had ordered Sy’s release last September, but the BI has kept him under detention while it appeals the ruling of the CA. Sy went on leave as chairman of the board of Global Ferronickel after his arrest. Due to his mining expertise, he has served as director of mining for the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which has issued calls for his immediate release, saying his continued detention sends a bad signal to potential investors. Global Ferronickel is the Philippines’ second biggest nickel ore exporter. Its subsidiary, Platinum Group Metals Corporation or PGMC, is the Philippines’ second largest nickel ore producer, accounting for around 12% of the total value of shipment of the country yearly from 2014 to 2024. It explores and mines for nickel mainly from Surigao del Norte in Mindanao. Sy became president of PGMC in July 2011 or 14 years ago. Global Ferronickel’s primary buyers are trading companies and end-users in China. Its Chinese customers use the nickel ore to produce intermediate products for the manufacture of stainless steel.

"MANILA, Philippines – The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has temporarily suspended field audits nationwide under Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 107-2025, a move that has raised questions among taxpayers and businesses currently under investigation. Issued on November 24, the circular pauses most audit and investigation activities to address long-standing systemic issues, strengthen taxpayer protection, and pave the way for a more transparent, standardized, and modern audit process. To clarify the scope of the suspension, the BIR later released RMC No. 109-2025 on December 12, which details the activities covered by the suspension and those that are exempt. Below is a practical Q&A guide to help taxpayers understand what the suspension means, who is affected, and what continues despite the pause. RMC No. 107-2025 temporarily halts BIR field audits and investigations to address systemic weaknesses in tax enforcement, protect taxpayer rights, and establish a more consistent and transparent audit framework. The suspension was issued under the leadership of newly appointed Commissioner Charlito Martin R. Mendoza. The suspension of BIR field audit activities took effect on November 24, 2025. Audit operations will remain on hold until the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issues a formal order lifting the suspension. During this period, only activities expressly exempted under the RMCs are allowed to continue. The suspension applies to all taxpayers currently undergoing audit or investigation, including individuals, corporations, estates, and business owners, provided the examination is being conducted under a Letter of Authority (LOA) or Mission Order (MO). Yes. The suspension covers all BIR offices nationwide, including: For audits covering multiple tax types, if at least one tax type is nearing its prescriptive deadline, the BIR will proceed with the entire audit to prevent incomplete investigations and protect the government’s right to collect taxes. The suspension covers most field audit operations, including: Certain actions are allowed to proceed, including: Notices issued before the suspension, such as Notice of Discrepancies (NODs), PANs, FANs, or FDDAs, remain valid. Taxpayers must continue to observe statutory deadlines for payment or filing protests. Payments for settlements finalized before the suspension may also continue. Moreover, taxpayers may voluntarily settle deficiency taxes during the suspension using BIR Form No. 0605 through eFPS, eBIRForms, or authorized agent banks, even without prior BIR approval. All concerned BIR offices must submit an inventory of pending or unserved LOAs and MOs to the CIR within 15 working days from the RMC’s effective date. For taxpayers, the suspension does not mean a break from compliance. The filing of returns and payment of taxes remain mandatory. Regular BIR transactions — such as registration, issuance of certifications, and tax payments — continue without interruption. RMC No. 107-2025, as clarified by RMC 109-2025, provides temporary relief from field audits but does not suspend tax obligations or enforcement altogether. By understanding what is paused, what continues, and which cases are exempt, taxpayers can better protect their rights while staying compliant during this transition toward a more transparent and standardized tax audit system. – Rappler.com ACG is the most trusted tax advisory firm in the Philippines, providing tax strategy, compliance, and policy advisory services to multinational corporations, foreign investors, and government institutions.

"MANILA, Philippines – Batangas Representative Leandro Leviste is being investigated for “selling” the franchise of his solar energy business to tycoon Manny V. Pangilinan, according to Ombudsman Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla. In a radio show on DZRH on Saturday, January 10, Remulla assailed Leviste for “flipping” Solar Philippines to Pangilinan after securing a franchise to put up solar microgrids in select provinces nationwide during the Rodrigo Duterte administration. “Kasi dapat yun yung franchise ‘di dapat ninenegosyo yun e. Batang-bata binebenta mo yung franchise, wala ka bang kahihiyan? Anong klaseng Pilipino yan?” he said. (A franchise shouldn’t be made into a business. He’s so young yet he’s selling a franchise, has he no shame? What kind of Filipino are you?) “National franchise, renewable energy, critical to the national life tapos ganun lang? Tapos, ‘bebenta mo, fi-flip mo lang? Nanay mo [Loren Legarda] pa senador,” Remulla said. (National franchise, renewable energy, critical to national life and then you sell just like that? You sell it, you flip it. And your mother is even a senator.) Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11357 into law on July 31, 2019, providing a franchise to Leviste’s Solar Para Sa Bayan Corporation. Remulla said this was the more important issue than the Cathy Cabral files which Leviste has exposed, adding that the files the congressman has are questionable. “Kasi marami s’yang ibang problema e. Yung prangkisa n’ya ineembistiga na ngayon e… Yung ang pagusapan muna natin, bago ang lahat,” he said. (He has other problems. His franchise is being investigated now… That’s what we should talk about first before anything else.) “Mas mabigat na isyu yung sa franchise n’ya. Remember, walang consent ang Congress sa transfer ng franchise na ‘yan. Critical ‘yan.” (His franchise is a bigger issue. Remember, there’s no consent from Congress for the transfer of the franchise. That’s critical.) Remulla also alleged that Leviste’s companies have a total of “84 cancelled [solar energy] contracts so far,” with significant impact on the country’s energy outlook. “Can you imagine the effect on the national energy situation. Sasabihin mo eto na ang forecast natin sa energy, andyan ang DOE [Department of Energy], naniniwala sayo, yun pala drawing lang,” he said. (Can you imagine the effect on the national energy situation? You give a forecast on energy, the DOE is there, it believes you and then it turns out to be just a drawing.) In an apparent response to Remulla’s statements, Leviste said he would respond to all the accusations made against him when Congress resumes its session on January 26. “Bibigyan ko kayo ng dalawang linggo para sabihin ang lahat. Sasagutin ko ang lahat sa pagbubukas ng Kongreso sa January 26,” Leviste said in a social media post, without specifying who he was referring to. (I will give you two weeks to say everything. I will answer all when Congress opens on January 26.) During a Senate hearing on the budget of the Department of Energy (DOE) last October, Energy Undersecretary Rowena Guevarra disclosed that 21 solar energy contracts of Leviste’s Solar Philippines are “being processed for termination due to the company’s failure to deliver the scheduled targets.” Rappler’s business columnist Val Villanueva, in his latest column, said the case of Leviste’s Solar Philippines “exposes how the country’s renewable-energy framework can be gamed.” Pangilinan’s Metro Pacific Investments Corporation started investing in Leviste’s SP New Energy Corporation (SPNEC) in March 2023, and by December 2023, Manila Electric Company subsidiary, Meralco PowerGen Corporation (MGEN), had completed its P15.9-billion buyout in Leviste’s SP New Energy Corporation (SPNEC), effectively becoming the controlling shareholder with 50.5% voting rights. Leviste became the vice chairman of SPNEC while Pangilinan assumed the role of chairman, president, and CEO of SPNEC. In October 2025, Solar Philippines announced that Leviste’s total divestments in SPNEC to the Meralco group had amounted to P18 billion, and that he would divest all his shares in SPNEC “with total proceeds expected at over P34 billion” following his election in May 2025 as congressman of the 1st District of Batangas. MGEN, in a media statement on Sunday, January 11, said SPNEC is a “separate and distinct corporate entity from Solar Para sa Bayan Corporation (SPBC),” the Leviste company that got a 25-year congressional franchise during the Duterte administration. “MGEN did not acquire any share in SPBC, which was awarded a congressional franchise thru Republic Act 11357 to construct and install and operate microgrids in remote areas. Moreover, MGEN is not privy to any transactions of SPBC nor to any circumstances that may relate to its compliance with its franchise,” the power firm said. Thus, MGEN said, “SPNEC’s business and operations are not dependent on the franchise mentioned.” MGEN also insisted that its investment in SPNEC “did not violate any law or regulation,” noting that “the transactions of SPNEC, including the entry of MGEN through its affiliates” were “scrutinized and approved by the Philippine Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission.” On Sunday, Leviste also reposted MGEN’s media statement on his Facebook page. – Rappler.com",True,true,Ombudsman Remulla says Leviste being probed for ‘selling’ solar franchise to Pangilinan,https://www.rappler.com/business/ombudsman-remulla-leandro-leviste-sale-solar-philippines-franchise-investigation/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – There’s a certain charm when a resort is owned by a family. The difference is palpable as soon as you walk in; it feels like a tropical Filipino home. The staff are warm and friendly, and convenience is everywhere: comfy seats in the welcome lounge, airy spaces that seamlessly lead to the infinity pool deck, and hallways that connect easily to the breezy lobby. And in the lobby, art pieces, décor, and chandeliers feel handpicked — local, personal, and beautifully Boholano. Up at the pool deck, chaise lounges offer an infinity pool view of the sea, and a short walk down the stairs leads you to the beachfront, filled with more chaises that are beside the resort’s Filipino restaurant for drinks and bites by the sea. Convenience and thoughtfulness are what built Panglao’s Modala Beach Resort, located on the quiet tip of Doljo Beach, far from the hustle of Alona Beach. Owned by the Mendoza family, the resort makes its warmth known through tiny details. Choices here are not corporation-driven but rooted in what the family itself looks for when they travel. “My mom used to say that her dad always wanted a resort or a home by the beach as a place for everybody to relax and get together. So, my parents decided to make just that,” daughter Elyssa Mendoza, who helps lead marketing for the resort, told Rappler. Panglao is most known by tourists for Alona Beach — busy, booked, and buzzing with commercial clamor. But not everyone wants to relax amid noise and crowds of beach-going tourists. The Mendoza family wanted to build something outside of that, to show people that the island has so much more to offer. “We want to create a place where people could slow down and truly appreciate the island’s beauty, which is why they fell in love with a quieter area of Panglao,” Mendoza said. The resort is built on two fundamentals: good rooms and good food. Just like their family, they wanted a “warm and welcoming” approach with a resort built around nature. “We know that some people prefer livelier places as a way to have fun and unwind, but there are also those who just want to get away from all the noise — my family is definitely the latter,” she added. Still, they wanted a resort where guests didn’t feel the need to leave. Next to Modala is the Moadto Strip Mall, a first for Panglao — the resort is directly connected to a two-level mall with restaurants, souvenir shops, bars, and cafés like Bohol Bee Farm, Gilligan’s, and more. (Pro tip: Get the signature lechon on Sundays, plus authentic Chinese cuisine, from Imperial Dragon). “My dad and mom have always been hands-on, but even more so when it came to building and conceptualizing Modala Beach Resort and Moadto Strip Mall,” she said. It was — and still is — a full family affair, building Modala from the ground up. Her dad, an engineer, was there from start to finish, ensuring everything was built and designed exactly as he envisioned. He had discovered this quiet area at the tip of Doljo and immediately fell in love with the place. Since around 2012, her mom and dad had already been thinking about what they wanted to create from this beautiful stretch of land. Her mom later stepped in with operations and the day-to-day side of things. But what the kids appreciated most was how their dad made sure the whole family was involved in the process. “He would always ask for our thoughts on the design and layout because it wasn’t just about creating something for guests to enjoy — it was also about building something we, as a family, could love and be proud of,” she said. It’s “family first” at Modala. Because the resort isn’t bound by corporate hierarchical decisions, there’s more freedom to move, experiment, and pivot when needed. “We are free to make decisions that come from the heart. We’re actually very involved with decisions — from how the resort was designed to the overall guest experience,” she said. And in the fast-paced travel and hospitality market, adapting quickly is an advantage. “If guests share feedback or new ideas, we can talk about it right away and make changes as soon as we can (of course, still following the SOP). But compared to hotel chains, the process or approval chain isn’t as intensive or long.” Some hotels are bound by global standards when it comes to design. For Modala, the modern resort concept infused with Filipino elements stemmed from what the Mendoza family personally loves. “The modern resort concept was initially developed by our original architect, WATG, but we made sure to mix it with Filipino-inspired elements that would make it unique to us,” Mendoza said. The resort’s stone finishes were inspired by the timeless yet modern bahay na bato style. Bohol’s natural beauty is highlighted in small details: textures and artwork around the resort champion the Chocolate Hills, the sea, and the island’s landscapes. There is no corporate template to follow; “we actually have the freedom to explore ideas and really make them our own,” she said, working closely with their team of engineers, architects, and interior designers who help bring these concepts to life. A lot of Modala’s ideas come from the family’s own travel experiences. They recently vacationed in South Africa and fell in love with its nature-centric appeal. “We take inspiration from hotels and resorts we’ve visited, pick out what worked well, and then adapt it to fit our local context by always adding a personal touch and a Filipino twist,” she said. She compared it to how you can buy taho anywhere, but in Baguio, they make strawberry taho because that’s what makes it theirs. “So in Bohol, where ube is popular, we would have days that offer ube champorado during breakfast, and we actually also do offer a few ube dishes like ube sinigang. It’s familiar yet unique, and I think that that is how we get to represent who we are and where we come from,” she shared. Because the Doljo area is quite far from the action, they hoped to make things more convenient for guests with Moadto Strip Mall — a place where people could eat, shop, and enjoy a change of scenery without needing to leave the area. “At least with the mall, guests can buy pasalubongs, try different cuisines, or grab some late-night snacks from the convenience store,” Mendoza said. “Fun fact: the mall’s design was actually inspired by Jurassic World. I still remember watching the movie with my dad and brother, and my dad kept telling us to pause and rewind the aerial view of the park because he loved how the big gates opened up to a walkway lined with stores leading to the main attraction. That became the design inspiration of the mall,” she shared. Having this complex was important to the family, as it proved that everything was built with the guest in mind, offering options but still maintaining that “relaxed resort” feel. Yes, a commercial option is nearby, but they wanted the resort experience to stay independent, comfortable, and luxurious. Modala Resort is also known for its Mangaon Ta restaurant, which means ‘let’s eat’ in Bisaya. “My dad always says that the three most important things in a resort are the people, food and beverage, and its location,” Mendoza said. With that, food became a big focus for them, and her parents were very particular about what the restaurant offered. For the family, food is part of the whole experience. They wanted guests to feel a sense of “home” through the dishes. Home-style dishes with a resort twist include the creamy sisig tartare and the lechon baka, served in tender slices with a savory-sweet profile. The ube sinigang is homey and comforting, while the tuna kinilaw features thinly cut slices dressed in a coconut milk vinaigrette. “Because we’re not part of a chain, we have the freedom to be more personal and flexible. We can adjust, experiment, and really connect with guests in our own way. I think that’s what makes Modala special — it’s proudly local, but it also welcomes the world with open arms.” They treat domestic and foreign guests the way they would welcome people into their own home — “with genuine smiles, thoughtfulness, and basically being maalaga (caring).” The Mendoza family trains their staff so they know how guests should be treated, but they never provide scripts or spiels. Each interaction is meant to feel natural and personal, not rehearsed or by-the-book. “We believe that each team member has their own personality and unique way of showing care, and we also want that to be seen in the interactions they have with our guests. I think that this helps us keep our hospitality and interactions authentic.” Just like in corporate meetings, families aren’t spared from bickering and disagreements. If anything, things sometimes get even more heated; being in a family comes with its own challenges. “Disagreements happen, and ideas clash from time to time. But at the same time, I would say that that’s what makes it special. Because we’re a family, there’s a deeper level of understanding and respect,” Mendoza shared. “I’ve seen firsthand how hard my parents worked to get to where they are, so I really value their input, advice, and experience. When they have comments or suggestions, I always listen, and if I have ideas that differ, I share them openly. I appreciate that they listen to our suggestions even if they might not always agree.” At the end of the day, the parents still have the final say — and the children respect that. “But they also trust me with the areas I handle, especially marketing and some creative decisions (like approvals for the interiors of the upcoming resorts!), and that trust means a lot to me,” she said. Disagreements come and go, but the Mendoza family’s values of warmth and togetherness remain at the core. And Mendoza believes that’s what helps guests feel at home at Modala. “We want every guest to feel like they’re part of our family or our home, not just visitors passing through. That’s where Filipino warmth and hospitality really shine,” she said. “You can feel it in the way our team greets you with a smile or makes sure you always have what you need — sometimes even before you ask.” Meaningful vacations matter deeply to her. “For some context, my parents were always busy growing up, so we didn’t have much time together aside from Sundays or during family trips. It was only during those trips that we got to spend meaningful time as one family.” With Modala, they wanted to create a place where other families could do the same. Looking forward, the family is building their umbrella brand, Tumoy Hotels and Resorts, with sub-brands such as Modala Beach Resort, Ma’oni Seascape Villas, and Mo’ayon Resort and Spa, all located within Tumoy Leisure Village. Their dream is to create a full leisure destination. Eventually, they hope to expand beyond Panglao to other parts of the Philippines, and even overseas. “We want to bring that same Filipino warmth, togetherness, and sense of home to more people around the world. But for now, our focus remains here. Building, learning, and sharing what we have, starting with Panglao.” Even as they grow, they intend to stay true to their homegrown, independent roots. “At its heart, this resort is more than a business — it’s my parents’ story,” she said. Both parents were born and raised in Cebu, which is why their brands proudly carry Bisaya names: Modala (to bring), Moadto (to go), Mo’ayon (to agree/like), Ma’oni (this is it), and Tumoy (end point). “Every part of Tumoy reflects my parents’ passion and hard work, and as their daughter, I want to make sure that story continues. That’s why I pushed to create a Tumoy Hotels and Resorts brand guide — so that no matter how far we expand, we never lose sight of where we started. At its core, Tumoy is a family of hotels dedicated to showcasing Filipino hospitality on a global scale, from beginning to end.” When a family sits at the center of the decision-making, guests feel it. The mother’s preferred massage becomes part of the spa offerings; the daughter’s favorite snacks by the beach end up on the menu; the father’s idea of a post-swim rest sets the cozy design of the rooms. These choices come from real lives, and not just a boardroom, and that’s why staying here feels less like booking a hotel and more like being welcomed into someone’s home. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Just a dream, now a destination: How a family built a Panglao resort rooted in home",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/modala-beach-resort-panglao-bohol-family-journey/,Rappler
"The Philippines’ alleged P1.7-trillion market meltdown which dominated the conversation in traditional and social media should have already shook down business, and could have spiraled into unimaginable crash. It didn’t because it wasn’t true. But in the minds of many, including equities players I held in esteem, the news somehow gained significant credibility. Surprisingly, no one cared to verify the claim, allowing the narrative to flourish with people sharing and discussing it at length as if it were gospel truth. It actually started as whispers in coffee shops. My friends deep inside the military establishment early on warned me that it could be part of a destabilization plot intended to take advantage of public anger about the infamous flood control scandal. I, for one, took the assertion for granted because the amount involved was too humongous to be believable. Moreover, the narrative was that the market loss happened in just three weeks! Unfortunately, the claim received more plausibility when Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Francis Lim virtually confirmed its veracity in a public forum: “The flood control project scandal has shaken public confidence, wiping out an extraordinary P1.7 trillion in market value of our publicly listed companies in just three weeks, despite rising corporate earnings. Investors aren’t fleeing because of weak fundamentals; they’re fleeing because of weak integrity. It’s a stark reminder that corruption is a weapon of mass wealth destruction.” Malacañang pushed back, branding the claim as fake news. In a media statement, Lim clarified that his speech before the Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines (FINEX) on October 7, “in which I cited a report claiming that recent corruption issues had wiped out about ₱1.7 trillion in market value of publicly listed companies” was sourced from “information, which had been circulating within business circles and cited by some media outlets, [which I believed at the time was] a credible industry report.” He added that he has since discovered the report to be fictitious. “I deeply regret any confusion or concern that my statement may have caused. My sole intent was to underscore the vital importance of integrity in our markets and the devastating impact corruption can have on investor confidence.” In a Viber message to Vantage Point, Lim said: “I really don’t know where [the claim] originated. As stated in my statement, it had been going around in some business orgs and was also mentioned in some news sources. But whatever it is, I take responsibility.” To get to the bottom of the issue, I did some forensic number-crunching. And this is what I found out: At least for one week in mid-September, the market cap rose ~1.91 % week over week. I gathered some weekly market cap figures: Using these data as rough proxies: So, roughly, over those approximate month spans: –2.6 % drop from July to August, then +2.5 % gain from late August into mid-September. (These are estimates based on weekly snapshots, not precise month‐end data.) I pulled the Philippine Stock Exchange’s (PSE) own Weekly Reports for July-September 2025 and computed the week-on-week (WoW) and month-on-month (MoM) moves in Total Market Capitalization. The forensic data from the PSE Weekly Reports itself effectively debunks the narrative that the market “lost ₱1.7 trillion in three weeks.” Let’s summarize the evidence clearly. From the PSE’s own published weekly total market capitalization, the changes are: From the table, we can see that: The ₱1.7 trillion “wiped-out value” claim cannot be substantiated by any verifiable PSE data. The real decline was ₱180 billion to ₱500 billion, depending on the window examined — roughly 1% to 3 % of total capitalization. So there. The forensic evidence from the exchange itself disproves the ₱1.7 trillion loss narrative. I’m starting to be convinced that this could be what my friends in the military were describing as an attempt at economic destabilization. There’s a ghost haunting the Philippines — not of the dead, but of deceit. It drifts through newsfeeds, lurks in headlines, and seeps into coffee-shop talk. The ₱1.7-trillion plunge in three weeks was a phantom loss — spectacular, terrifying, and utterly unreal. No such collapse happened. The numbers were twisted shadows of truth, distorted by echo chambers hungry for drama. Yet the ghost of that story walked through trading floors, spooking investors and citizens alike. It fed on our greatest weakness: our disbelief in those who govern us. Because when the living institutions no longer inspire trust, the ghosts of falsehood rise to fill the void. That is the real tragedy. The same spirit of suspicion haunts the ongoing flood control scandal — an investigation that promised cleansing, but which is turning out to be a séance of self-interest. Every revelation feels pre-scripted, every “witness” seems conjured, and every pronouncement reeks of political necromancy. Instead of exorcising corruption, our leaders are raising old ghosts for partisan gain. We used to believe in evidence, in process, in due diligence. Now we believe in what sounds dramatic. The ₱1.7-trillion ghost story spread faster than any official correction because truth has become the weaker spirit. The bureaucracy speaks in technicalities, the politicians speak in riddles, and the people — tired of decoding lies — cling to whatever version of reality feeds their outrage. This is the new governance curse: when credibility dies, myths inherit the throne. The flood control probe should have been a beacon of reform; instead, it is a fog machine. Each hearing spawns new specters of accusation, while genuine accountability remains invisible. And like the stock-market scare, this pattern reveals a deeper malaise — not just corruption, but the erosion of public faith. Governance without trust is a haunted house. Every press release, every Senate statement, every “exclusive” leak creaks with suspicion. Even facts, when uttered by officials, sound like apparitions rehearsed to deceive. We must learn to exorcise these ghosts — not by burning effigies or silencing critics, but by reviving transparency and integrity in governance. Truth must once again stand solid, not give rise to the spectral. Until then, we remain a nation haunted — by phantoms of corruption, by specters of falsehood, and by the chilling realization that the most dangerous ghosts are the ones we keep believing in. There is still time to break the spell, but it requires courage from both leaders and people. The government must dare to confront its own ghosts — the culture of impunity, the comfort of secrecy, the tolerance for mediocrity. The people must dare to confront their ghosts — the addiction to outrage, the laziness of blind belief, the refusal to verify before sharing. Truth is not dead. It is merely buried beneath layers of clamor, neglect, and apathy. To resurrect the truth, we must become a nation of exorcists — each of us must be committed to dispelling lies, not spreading them. Until then, we remain a haunted republic: our markets shaken by illusions, our politics ruled by phantoms, and our collective soul chained to skepticism. The ghost that shook the market is not just an economic apparition — it is the spirit of our own surrender. And unless we learn to face it, it will keep returning, whispering the same warning: A nation that no longer believes in truth is already halfway to its grave. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] The ghostly P1.7-trillion market plunge,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-ghostly-trillion-peso-market-plunge/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – People often joke that their favorite snack is “like crack” or call themselves “chocoholics” in jest. But can someone really be addicted to food in the same way they could be hooked on substances such as alcohol or nicotine? As an addiction psychiatrist and researcher with experience in treating eating disorders and obesity, I have been following the research in this field for the past few decades. I have written a textbook on food addiction, obesity and overeating disorders, and, more recently, a self-help book for people who have intense cravings and obsessions for some foods. While there is still some debate among psychologists and scientists, a consensus is emerging that food addiction is a real phenomenon. Hundreds of studies have confirmed that certain foods – often those that are high in sugar and ultraprocessed – affect the brains and behavior of certain people similarly to other addictive substances such as nicotine. Still, many questions remain about which foods are addictive, which people are most susceptible to this addiction and why. There are also questions as to how this condition compares to other substance addictions and whether the same treatments could work for patients struggling with any kind of addiction. The neurobiological mechanisms of addiction have been mapped out through decades of laboratory-based research using neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience approaches. Studies show that preexisting genetic and environmental factors set the stage for developing an addiction. Regularly consuming an addictive substance then causes a rewiring of several important brain systems, leading the person to crave more and more of it. This rewiring takes place in three key brain networks that correspond to key functional domains, often referred to as the reward system, the stress response system and the system in charge of executive control. First, using an addictive substance causes the release of a chemical messenger called dopamine in the reward network, which makes the user feel good. Dopamine release also facilitates a neurobiological process called conditioning, which is basically a neural learning process that gives rise to habit formation. As a result of the conditioning process, sensory cues associated with the substance start to have increasing influence over decision-making and behavior, often leading to a craving. For instance, because of conditioning, the sight of a needle can drive a person to set aside their commitment to quit using an injectable drug and return to it. Second, continued use of an addictive substance over time affects the brain’s emotional or stress response network. The user’s body and mind build up a tolerance, meaning they need increasing amounts of the substance to feel its effect. The neurochemicals involved in this process are different than those mediating habit formation and include a chemical messenger called noradrenaline and internally produced opioids such as endorphins. If they quit using the substance, they experience symptoms of withdrawal, which can range from irritability and nausea to paranoia and seizures. At that point, negative reinforcement kicks in. This is the process by which a person keeps going back to a substance because they’ve learned that using the substance doesn’t just feel good, but it also relieves negative emotions. During withdrawal from a substance, people feel profound emotional discomfort, including sadness and irritability. Negative reinforcement is why someone who is trying to quit smoking, for instance, will be at highest risk of relapse in the week just after stopping and during times of stress, because in the past they’d normally turn to cigarettes for relief. Third, overuse of most addictive substances progressively damages the brain’s executive control network, the prefrontal cortex, and other key parts of the brain involved in impulse control and self-regulation. Over time, the damage to these areas makes it more and more difficult for the user to control their behavior around these substances. This is why it is so hard for long-term users of many addictive substances to quit.Scientists have learned more about what’s happening in a person’s brain when they become addicted to a substance. Many studies over the past 25 years have shown that high-sugar and other highly pleasurable foods – often foods that are ultraprocessed – act on these brain networks in ways that are similar to other addictive substances. The resulting changes in the brain fuel further craving for and overuse of the substance – in this case, highly rewarding food. Clinical studies have demonstrated that people with an addictive relationship to food demonstrate the hallmark signs of a substance use disorder. Studies also indicate that for some people, cravings for highly palatable foods go well beyond just a normal hankering for a snack and are, in fact, signs of addictive behavior. One study found that cues associated with highly pleasurable foods activate the reward centers in the brain, and the degree of activation predicts weight gain. In other words, the more power the food cue has to capture a person’s attention, the more likely they are to succumb to cravings for it. Multiple studies have also found that suddenly ending a diet that’s high in sugar can cause withdrawal, similar to when people quit opioids or nicotine. Excessive exposure to high-sugar foods has also been found to reduce cognitive function and cause damage to the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, the parts of the brain that mediate executive control and memory. In another study, when obese people were exposed to food and told to resist their craving for it by ignoring it or thinking about something else, their prefrontal cortexes were more active compared with nonobese individuals. This indicates that it was more difficult for the obese group to fight their cravings. Addiction recovery is often centered on the idea that the fastest way to get well is to abstain from the problem substance. But unlike nicotine or narcotics, food is something that all people need to survive, so quitting cold turkey isn’t an option. In addition, eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder often occur alongside addictive eating. Most psychologists and psychiatrists believe these illnesses have their root cause in excessive dietary restriction. For this reason, many eating disorder treatment professionals balk at the idea of labeling some foods as addictive. They are concerned that encouraging abstinence from particular foods could trigger binge eating and extreme dieting to compensate. But others argue that, with care, integrating food addiction approaches into eating disorders treatment is feasible and could be lifesaving for some. The emerging consensus around this link is moving researchers and those who treat eating disorders to consider food addiction in their treatment models. One such approach might look like the one described to me by addiction psychiatrist and eating disorders specialist Dr. Kim Dennis. In line with traditional eating disorder treatment, nutritionists at her residential clinic strongly discourage their patients from restricting calories. At the same time, in line with traditional addiction treatment, they help their patients to consider significantly reducing or completely abstaining from particular foods to which they have developed an addictive relationship. Additional clinical studies are already being carried out. But going forward, more studies are needed to help clinicians find the most effective treatments for people with an addictive relationship with food. Efforts are underway by groups of psychologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists and mental health providers to get “ultraprocessed food use disorder,” also known as food addiction, into future editions of diagnostic manuals such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases. Beyond acknowledging what those treating food addiction are already seeing in the field, this would help researchers get funding for additional studies of treating food addiction. With more information about what treatments will work best for whom, those who have these problems will no longer have to suffer in silence, and providers will be better equipped to help them. – Rappler.com",True,true,Can you really be addicted to food?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/addiction-food-researcher-drug-addiction-similarities/,Rappler

"MANILA, Philippines – In a historic first, the Michelin Guide unveiled its selection of Philippine restaurants for 2026 on Thursday, October 30, during an awarding ceremony at the Manila Marriott Hotel in Pasay City. It marked a milestone for the country, as it was the first time in the Michelin Guide’s 125-year history that it has expanded to the Philippines. A total of 108 establishments were recognized, with one earning two Michelin stars, eight taking home a one-star rating, 25 under the Bib Gourmand distinction, and 74 included in the Michelin Guide Selection. Several chefs and restaurants also received special awards celebrating service, sustainability, and innovation. The lone Philippine restaurant that earned two Michelin stars — an honor for “excellent cooking, worth a detour” — is Helm in Makati City by chef Josh Boutwood, who is also behind The Test Kitchen and Juniper. The Michelin Guide states of Helm: “This modern restaurant reflects the chef’s half-British, half-Filipino roots and Spanish influences, blending creativity with precision. The themed, seasonal set menus range from street food to film-inspired surprises; the experience is always evolving yet consistently refined. Expect layered, bold flavors and intricate presentations. An open kitchen and counter seats foster connection. The warm, professional service completes the dining experience.” Meanwhile, the eight restaurants that got one star signify “high-quality cooking, worth a stop.” The Michelin Guide announced the following one-star restaurants, including a short description of each. Asador Alfonso – “Their ingredients are sourced directly from Spain to deliver authentic dishes that balance rustic simplicity with remarkable depth and character.” Celera – “Two chef-owners craft contemporary Asian dishes that draw on influences from Japan, China, Singapore, and beyond. Diners can expect umami dishes using dashi and subtle smoke, with artful plating and hospitable service.” Gallery by Chele – “Culinary excellence meets environmental integrity, from local sourcing and waste reduction to educating diners.” Hapag by Thirdy Dolatre, Kevin Navoa, and Erin Recto – “Tapping into the full potential of local ingredients, Hapag brings a modern, sophisticated touch to traditional dishes. This inventive approach honors regional recipes and time-honored methods.” Inatô by JP Cruz – “Reimaging Filipino cuisine with flair…delivered with seamless, warm interaction in a calm and elegant setting.” Kasa Palma by Aaron Isip – “The chef draws on French techniques and global influences — from Latin America to Southeast Asia — and makes good use of wood fire. From local ingredients, they go into expressive, refined dishes.” Linamnam by Don Baldosano – “Deeply personal dishes are rooted in regional tradition, shaped by the chef’s philosophy.” Toyo Eatery by Jordy Navarra – “Balancing seasoning in his restaurant — soy sauce, vinegar, fish sauce — to enhance the dishes and highlight local flavors.” The Bib Gourmand distinction, first introduced in 1997, is awarded to restaurants offering high-quality food at reasonable prices — what the Michelin Guide calls “best value for money.” The price bracket varies per country, depending on the cost of living, but the goal remains the same: to spotlight “delicious food” that’s accessible. 2026’s awardees are: The Michelin Selected category represents restaurants that use quality ingredients and cook them well — simply “a good meal,” according to Michelin inspectors. These restaurants are part of the guide’s official recommendations, even if they have not (yet) received a star or Bib Gourmand distinction. Included for 2026 are: Michelin also honored certain individuals and establishments for their outstanding contributions to the dining scene. Don Patrick Baldosano of Linamnam received the Michelin Guide Young Chef Award, while the Michelin Green Star for sustainability was awarded to Gallery by Chele. Erin Recto of Hapag took home the Michelin Service Award, while Benjamin Leal of Uma Nota earned the Exceptional Cocktails Award. The highest Michelin star rating is three stars. For decades, Michelin stars have shaped the culinary maps of cities like Tokyo, Paris, and Bangkok, turning restaurants into tourist destinations. Now, the Philippines is on the global map, giving Filipino chefs and restaurateurs a broader platform, while also encouraging diners and tourists to discover the country’s local creativity, ingredients, and diversity. – Rappler.com",True,true,Michelin stars and awards: Which Philippine restaurants made it to the inaugural list?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/michelin-guide-philippines-restaurants-stars-awards-2026/,Rappler
"Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer: I am a senior citizen, 53 years old, and engaged to another senior citizen. This will be a second marriage for us both. My first marriage ended because my husband was unfaithful. After over 20 years, I finally got my annulment. His first marriage lasting 33 years ended amicably, via divorce. They outgrew each other, but they are still friends. My problem is this. Before our engagement my fiancé “John” had a girlfriend “Melanie” (4 years together). Before that, even before he had his girlfriend Melanie, John and I were together until I realized he could not commit himself to me exclusively. Only after we broke up he got himself this girlfriend. They broke up, he courted me again, promising this time it would be different. He has kept his promise. We are scheduled to be married this April. My problem is that Melanie won’t leave him alone. She always finds an excuse to connect with him, even after their breakup. First, because she was “so hurt” she made him promise he could not contact me for a month. He obeyed her, despite him already courting me. I was so worried when I did not hear from him, but still he did that because he wanted to keep his word to Melanie. They had already broken up by then, but still, he obeyed her. Second, he invited me to go to South Africa with him. We went and both loved it. I only found out after that they too had plans to go there before they broke up. When she found out he was taking me, she called him and asked him to postpone his trip with me for a year so it would not hurt her too much. Finally, Melanie also ordered some special delicacies John’s family is known for. She wants it for April 19, because she will be in the Philippines that day. She told his family this, they told John, and John eventually told me. April 22 is when we are scheduled to be married. We have already booked the church and the venue. I cannot stop thinking about Melanie’s plans to be in the Philippines three days before our wedding. I do not want to have to fight for him 3 days before we get married. I am not as sophisticated as Melanie. I do not have the skills to fight this without breaking down and crying. Please help me. – Lenny Dear Lenny, As you yourself admit, John has a less than stellar reputation. First time round, you broke up because he couldn’t offer you an exclusive relationship. Second time round, despite promises that things would be different, all the signs are that he is clinging on to his relationship with his ex, Melanie, who herself is showing no signs of giving him up. It may be true that he is not technically cheating on you — not contacting you, delaying trips and ordering delicacies are not the equivalent of sexual infidelity — but they do not suggest an exclusive relationship with you either. Instead, he seems anxious to keep in touch with Melanie and cater unquestioningly to her whims. These are not the actions of a man readying himself to pronounce his marriage vow to “love, honor and cherish you, forsaking all others.” The months before a wedding are usually the time when the bridegroom to be is on his best behavior, trying to persuade you that your choice of spouse is fully justified. Instead, he is dancing to the tune of a previous girlfriend. It is time to call him out, before the wedding, before it’s too late. Either he cuts all ties with Melanie and demonstrates his love, devotion, respect and attention to you exclusively or you should seriously reconsider his suitability as a future husband. A fiancé who puts you first, keeps his promises, and consigns his ex to history is the very least you should expect. All the best, – JAF Baer Dear Lenny, Thank you very much for your letter. I must admit I did not expect Mr. Baer to adopt such a strong, take-no-prisoners stand. Mr. Baer has already decided that John is a doormat, still doing what his ex Melanie asks him to do. I disagree. Yes, he did the almost inexcusable: not calling you for a month when you would understandably be more nervous than usual because this would be the first time John and his ex would meet again. Yes, he should have known better. Admittedly, I have never met John, but I feel the reason for his one-month silence was NOT because he chose Melanie over you, but because he didn’t want to hurt her. Take note: because she was ‘so hurt” she felt her “no-contact-for-a-month” request would not be a problem. After 4 years, she knows John and what works with him. This hypothesis is borne out because she again used the “so hurt” excuse when she called and told him she would again be hurt if he did not postpone his South Africa trip for a year. Melanie knows him enough to know this would ordinarily work. What she didn’t factor in was that John, after acquiescing to her first request and, I imagine, after you then told him how you felt about his silence, was a bit more discerning about her machinations. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. He did go to South Africa with you in less than a year, despite her being “hurt.” If you are the type to count wins and losses (as, alas, often I am) this time you “won.” Best of all, you won without having to fight for it, without even knowing Melanie asked this of him. I daresay he is starting to discern the difference between an ex girlfriend and his fiancé. Good for him, good for you both, Win 2 for you! Regrading her final attempt planned for April 19 — this time you can tell him how you feel. I agree with Jeremy’s advice to cut and cut cleanly in case he doesn’t immediately agree with you. The first time he acquiesced, I feel, can be forgiven because he didn’t want to hurt her. Whether with basis or not, he probably felt breaking up with her was not gentlemanly so the least he could do is make it hurt less. (P.S. if the marriage pulls through in April, I think I should be Ninang, don’t you? 😊) This third attempt should be a clear message to Melanie that it’s over between them. Not only is he in love with you, but he loves you and wants to spend the rest of his life with you. If you are not 100% sure of this by now, then I agree entirely with Mr. Baer: “A fiancé who puts you first, keeps his promises, and consigns his ex to history is the very least you should expect.” All the best, – MG Holmes – Rappler.com",True,true,[Two Pronged] Fiancé’s ex-girlfriend won’t stop contacting him,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/two-pronged-fiance-ex-girlfriend-keeps-contacting-him/,Rappler
"Picture this: It’s New Year’s Eve, the family is complete — your uncle is cooking adobo, your aunt is serving carbonara, and there’s already that familiar tang of red wine in the air, either saved for later or because your dad has popped the bottle early. The lights are dim, gifts sit neatly about the living room, and everyone has finally settled around the dining table. But just as you reach for a piece of lechon kawali, you hear it! That all-too-familiar adorable whine or purr from under the table. Your dog or cat looks up at you with those irresistible eyes, silently asking for a bite. It’s a familiar dilemma for many pet owners: do you give in, or do you say no? While it’s tempting to share our holiday food with the pets we love, the festive season can be tougher on their health than we realize. Richer meals, more treats, and disrupted routines can quietly take a toll on their well-being. But worry not! Here are expert-backed tips to help keep your pets fit, happy, and healthy throughout the holiday season. Weight gain is among the most common pet health issues, especially during the holidays, when routines change drastically and treats are more readily available. “One of the most common mistakes that pet owners make is overfeeding,” says Dr. Evelyn Austria, veterinarian and Royal Canin’s scientific communication manager. She noted that overfeeding, while often driven by affection toward pets, is often a result of many pet owners being unaware that pets, like humans, have different energy requirements depending on their lifestyle. This habit often begins early. Puppyhood and kittenhood, for instance, are indeed exciting stages, and many owners become eager to introduce various treats, and even “table food,” such as our leftovers. Young pets, however, have sensitive digestive systems that are not yet fully developed. “Puppies and kittens, when they are growing, [they still] have sensitive guts. They are still not [yet] fully developed,” she adds. Lifestyle also plays a key role in nutrition. Indoor pets generally require fewer calories than highly active ones, which is why specialized diets are formulated with lower calorie and protein content to match their energy needs. Lastly, exercise remains essential regardless of whether pets live indoors or outdoors. Daily walks, playtime, and mental stimulation support weight control, joint health, and longevity, making regular activity a non-negotiable part of responsible pet care, even — and especially — during the busy holiday season. Given the abundance of food during the holidays, it’s often tempting for pet owners to share leftovers with their pets. However, many traditional Filipino dishes served during noche buena or big dinners can be harmful to animals. Dr. Austria reminds pet owners to be particularly mindful of what they feed their pets during the festive season, noting that well-meaning habits can sometimes lead to serious health problems. “Be careful of what you’re feeding your pets during the holidays,” she said. “We don’t recommend giving leftovers.” Rich and fatty foods such as lechon kawali, along with other indulgent holiday dishes, can trigger digestive issues and more severe conditions like pancreatitis, which is a painful and potentially life-threatening illness that veterinarians frequently see spike during the holiday season. Sudden exposure to oily, salty, or heavily seasoned food can overwhelm a pet’s digestive system, particularly for those with sensitive stomachs or underlying health conditions. While it’s understandable for pet owners to want their pets to feel included during family meals, experts stress that inclusion does not have to come at the expense of their health. Instead of sharing table food, pet owners are encouraged to offer treats that are specifically formulated for pets. These alternatives allow our little companions to participate safely in the festivities without the risk associated with human food, helping ensure that the holiday season remains enjoyable for both pets and their families. In today’s digital age, many pet owners turn to the internet for advice, including homemade diet recipes. However not all online sources are reliable, and well-meaning recommendations can sometimes do more harm than good. Diets that appear healthy or “natural” may still lack essential nutrients, especially when followed long-term without professional guidance. Veterinary and pet nutrition experts from Royal Canin explained that proper pet nutrition is not about individual ingredients alone, but also about achieving the right balance of nutrients. These diets are formulated by veterinary nutritionists to support pets’ needs across different life stages, body sizes, and activity levels. Dr. Austria cited a study that evaluated 200 homemade pet diets found online. However, the study revealed that only 5% of these diets were complete and well-balanced. This means the vast majority were nutritionally inadequate for long-term feeding and could potentially lead to health issues over time. As the holidays approach, remembering our pets’ needs is one of the simplest yet most meaningful ways to care for them. With proper nutrition and informed choices guided by expert advice, pet owners can help ensure that the festive season remains joyful and safe, not just for the family, but for our beloved little companions, too. – Angel Baleña/Rappler.com Angel Baleña is a Rappler intern studying Creative Writing at University of the Philippines Diliman.",True,true,Expert-backed tips to keep your pets healthy this holiday season,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/tips-keep-pets-healthy-holiday-season/,Rappler
"Ordinary and universal, the act of writing changes the brain. From dashing off a heated text message to composing an op-ed, writing allows you to, at once, name your pain and create distance from it. Writing can shift your mental state from overwhelm and despair to grounded clarity — a shift that reflects resilience. Psychology, the media and the wellness industry shape public perceptions of resilience: Social scientists study it, journalists celebrate it, and wellness brands sell it. They all tell a similar story: Resilience is an individual quality that people can strengthen with effort. The American Psychological Association defines resilience as an ongoing process of personal growth through life’s challenges. News headlines routinely praise individuals who refuse to give up or find silver linings in times of hardship. The wellness industry promotes relentless self-improvement as the path to resilience. In my work as a professor of writing studies, I research how people use writing to navigate trauma and practice resilience. I have witnessed thousands of students turn to the written word to work through emotions and find a sense of belonging. Their writing habits suggest that writing fosters resilience. Insights from psychology and neuroscience can help explain how. In the 1980s, psychologist James Pennebaker developed a therapeutic technique called expressive writing to help patients process trauma and psychological challenges. With this technique, continuously journaling about something painful helps create mental distance from the experience and eases its cognitive load. In other words, externalizing emotional distress through writing fosters safety. Expressive writing turns pain into a metaphorical book on a shelf, ready to be reopened with intention. It signals the brain, “You don’t need to carry this anymore.” Translating emotions and thoughts into words on paper is a complex mental task. It involves retrieving memories and planning what to do with them, engaging brain areas associated with memory and decision-making. It also involves putting those memories into language, activating the brain’s visual and motor systems. Writing things down supports memory consolidation — the brain’s conversion of short-term memories into long-term ones. The process of integration makes it possible for people to reframe painful experiences and manage their emotions. In essence, writing can help free the mind to be in the here and now. The state of presence that writing can elicit is not just an abstract feeling; it reflects complex activity in the nervous system. Brain imaging studies show that putting feelings into words helps regulate emotions. Labeling emotions — whether through expletives and emojis or carefully chosen words — has multiple benefits. It calms the amygdala, a cluster of neurons that detects threat and triggers the fear response: fight, flight, freeze or fawn. It also engages the prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain that supports goal-setting and problem-solving. In other words, the simple act of naming your emotions can help you shift from reaction to response. Instead of identifying with your feelings and mistaking them for facts, writing can help you simply become aware of what’s arising and prepare for deliberate action. Even mundane writing tasks like making a to-do list stimulate parts of the brain involved in reasoning and decision-making, helping you regain focus. Choosing to write is also choosing to make meaning. Studies suggest that having a sense of agency is both a prerequisite for, and an outcome of, writing. Researchers have long documented how writing is a cognitive activity — one that people use to communicate, yes, but also to understand the human experience. As many in the field of writing studies recognize, writing is a form of thinking — a practice that people never stop learning. With that, writing has the potential to continually reshape the mind. Writing not only expresses but actively creates identity. Writing also regulates your psychological state. And the words you write are themselves proof of regulation — the evidence of resilience. Popular coverage of human resilience often presents it as extraordinary endurance. News coverage of natural disasters implies that the more severe the trauma, the greater the personal growth. Pop psychology often equates resilience with unwavering optimism. Such representations can obscure ordinary forms of adaptation. Strategies people already use to cope with everyday life — from rage-texting to drafting a resignation letter — signify transformation. These research-backed tips can help you develop a writing practice conducive to resilience: 1. Write by hand whenever possible. In contrast to typing or tapping on a device, handwriting requires greater cognitive coordination. It slows your thinking, allowing you to process information, form connections and make meaning. 2. Write daily. Start small and make it regular. Even jotting brief notes about your day — what happened, what you’re feeling, what you’re planning or intending — can help you get thoughts out of your head and ease rumination. 3. Write before reacting. When strong feelings surge, write them down first. Keep a notebook within reach and make it a habit to write it before you say it. Doing so can support reflective thinking, helping you act with purpose and clarity. 4. Write a letter you never send. Don’t just write down your feelings — address them to the person or situation that’s troubling you. Even writing a letter to yourself can provide a safe space for release without the pressure of someone else’s reaction. 5. Treat writing as a process. Any time you draft something and ask for feedback on it, you practice stepping back to consider alternative perspectives. Applying that feedback through revision can strengthen self-awareness and build confidence. Resilience may be as ordinary as the journal entries people scribble, the emails they exchange, the task lists they create — even the essays students pound out for professors. The act of writing is adaptation in progress. – Rappler.com Emily Ronay Johnston is an assistant teaching professor of Global Arts, Media and Writing Studies at University of California, Merced.

"MANILA, Philippines – Six business groups and trade unions, often at odds on gut issues, issued a common stand on the Marcos administration’s anti-corruption drive, urging the government to take bold and concrete steps to curb corruption. In an open letter to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the groups lamented the lack of criminal charges filed against contractors and public works officials allegedly involved in corruption of flood control and other infrastructure projects. “Instead of going after the most guilty, we are led on political detours, chasing the less guilty, depending on who sits where and who stands with whom,” they wrote. The open letter was signed by the Employers Confederation of the Philippines, Federation of Free Workers, Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Philippine Exporters Confederation Incorporated, Sentro ng mga Nagkakaisa at Progresibong Manggagawa, and the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines. This is the latest open letter calling for Marcos’ urgent action on the Philippines’ worst corruption scandal. Other business groups have also called for urgency in anti-corruption reform, and voiced support for actions that may curb corruption and money laundering. The groups further said that Filipino workers and entrepreneurs have carried the burden of sustaining the country through hard work and tax payments. However, taxes that they have religiously paid to the government never translated into much-needed infrastructure. “People’s money to build classrooms that were never constructed, health centers that never opened, farm-to-market roads that were never paved, and flood control projects that were never built or never worked,” they said. The undersigned groups challenged Marcos to prove that his anti-corruption drive is not just a matter of selective justice. They recommended the following action steps: The Marcos administration has already responded positively to a few of these recommendations, and Congress vowed to open the bicameral conference committee hearings on the budget to the public. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Business, workers’ groups lament slow progress in anti-corruption drive",https://www.rappler.com/business/groups-lament-slow-progress-anti-corruption-drive/,Rappler
"MADRID, Spain – A 1919 Pablo Picasso painting has disappeared in transit ahead of its display at a temporary exhibition in the southern Spanish city of Granada, prompting a police investigation, according to the foundation organizing the exhibit. The CajaGranada Foundation said in a statement late on Thursday that the missing piece – a small framed gouache titled Still life with guitar – was part of a larger shipment of artworks moved from Madrid to the Andalusian city for the exhibition Still life. The eternity of the inert. The foundation confirmed on Friday that the painting, owned by a private collector and measuring 13 x 10 centimeters (5 x 4 inches), was insured for an appraised value of 600,000 euros ($700,000). The shipment was delivered to the CajaGranada cultural center on the morning of October 3, a Friday. The loss was not discovered until the following Monday, when the exhibit’s curator and the foundation’s head of exhibitions began unpacking the crates. “As not all packages were properly numbered, it was not possible to carry out a thorough check without unpacking them,” the foundation added. The CajaGranada Foundation said it had reviewed the security footage from that weekend and confirmed “no incident occurred” during that time. After discovering the painting was missing, the foundation filed a complaint with Spain’s national police. The organization said it has made all its resources available to investigators and expressed confidence in the authorities’ ability to resolve the case.

"(This is a press release from the Asian Forum on Enterprise for Society 2025.) On November 11–12, the Asian Institute of Management (AIM) will convene the Asian Forum on Enterprise for Society (AFES) 2025 at the Makati Shangri-La. The forum comes at a moment defined by accelerating disruption — climate instability, fractured geopolitics, and the rapid advance of artificial intelligence — and will address the responsibilities of enterprises in navigating these challenges with resilience and purpose. Two keynote speakers will frame the proceedings. Ban Ki-moon, former secretary-general of the United Nations, is widely recognized for his leadership in advancing the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, chairman of Ayala Corporation, has been a leading advocate for sustainability-driven corporate transformation in Asia. Together, they represent the convergence of international diplomacy and private enterprise in addressing the urgent demands of the present. With the theme “Navigating Disruption: Enterprise Priorities for a Resilient Future,” AFES 2025 will focus on the most pressing issues confronting business and society. Discussions will explore climate solutions rooted in nature, the ethical integration of artificial intelligence, the imperatives of diversity and inclusion, and the role of education in preparing the next generation for resilience. The forum will also highlight the potential of micro-entrepreneurship and inclusive finance to empower communities, while closing sessions will examine how to reinforce global supply chains and sustain collaborative commitments that balance profitability with broader social responsibility. For AIM, which has trained leaders in Asia for more than half a century, hosting AFES reflects a mission that stretches beyond management education. It is an assertion that enterprises, particularly in a region defined by both volatility and vitality, can be engines not only of economic growth but also of social progress. Launched in 2002, AFES has become the region’s leading platform for dialogue between business and society, convened through AIM’s Ramon V. Del Rosario Sr. Center for Corporate Responsibility. Its purpose has always been to test the ways in which power — corporate, political, and civic — might be aligned with the imperatives of a sustainable future. – Rappler.com For more information, visit afes.aim.edu.",True,true,Former UN chief Ban Ki-moon to speak in AFES 2025 forum in Makati,https://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/events/asian-forum-enterprise-society-november-2025/,Rappler
"When was the last time you entered a room and felt the weight of responsibility and possibility at the same time? As an Asia 21 fellow this year, I asked myself this as I walked into the Asia 21 Next Generation Fellows Summit this December 5 to 7 held in Manila, my first gathering as part of the 2025 cohort. I had imagined the moment for years. Back in college, I remember reading about Asia 21 Fellows who were shaping policy, building communities, and challenging systems. I followed their stories like a student studying constellations that are visible, distant, but guiding. And suddenly, there I was, no longer just looking up at the stars but meeting them, learning with them, and realizing I now shared the responsibility to shine. The summit, organized by Asia Society Philippines and led by Natalie Ching Jorge, Doris Magsaysay Ho, and Fernando Zobel De Ayala, was a powerful reminder that leadership isn’t a title, it’s a lifelong practice of courage, humility, and service. Standing beside co-fellows I had only ever read about (including my 2025 co-fellow Filipino classmate Kenneth Abante), I felt the quiet thrill of belonging to a circle of people who still believe that change is possible, that institutions can evolve, and that communities deserve leaders who listen as much as they act. The Asia Society website framed our selection as a recognition of courageous leadership. But for me, it felt more like an invitation: now that you are here, what will you do with this space? The question followed me all the way to Palawan for the Asia 21 travel caravan. And as if the universe wanted to insist on an answer, it sent us two Filipino Asia 21 Fellows whose journeys could fill entire books. Amina Swananpoel (Class of 2011), executive director of Roots of Health, has dedicated her life to reproductive rights, dignity, and women’s health in Palawan, a work that is rarely glamorous but always life-changing. Walking through their clinic and community spaces felt like stepping inside a living manifesto of compassion. Her work reminds us that development is not measured in impressive metrics but in whether people feel safer, healthier, and more human. Then there was Quintin Pastrana (Class of 2008), someone I had long admired from afar for his clean energy advocacy and his leadership in Sabang Renewable Energy Corporation. Seeing Sabang’s microgrid in person, an award-winning model of hybrid renewable power, was grounding. Quintin didn’t just talk about climate solutions; he built one in a place where energy once meant diesel, darkness, or none at all. Quintin and I had the chance to briefly talk about collaboration for climate solutions, a conversation that felt less like planning and more like anchoring shared values. He also mentioned something that delighted me: the capstone of Asian Institute Management MDM graduates — Carl Vincent Gapasin, Xien Palacios and Novee Nalica. Their research explores how solar panels can coexist with agriculture, a topic that mirrors the very spirit of Sabang’s hybrid systems. Knowing about their academic work intersects with real-world energy transitions reminded me that the pipeline of Filipino climate innovators is stronger than we think. Sometimes, all they need is a platform, and mentors like Quintin who are willing to lift them into the conversation. What do we teach in business school, really? Two weeks before Palawan and the Summit, I stepped into another room, this time as keynote speaker at the National Business Management Conference of De La Salle University and the Philippine Academy of Management. It was a gathering of scholars, deans, researchers, and students. And in my mind, I carried the faces of farmers I work with, entrepreneurs trying to survive, and community leaders who measure success in meals fed, hectares restored, or dreams made possible. So, I asked the room a question I ask myself often: Do we teach business to make profit, or do we teach business to make impact? This wasn’t rhetorical. It was an invitation to rethink the systems that shape young leaders at the very beginning of their trajectories. For decades, business education has been framed around competition, market share, and bottom lines. But in a world facing climate breakdown, inequity, and fragility, what kind of leaders are we producing if we don’t anchor the curriculum in justice, sustainability, and human dignity? In my keynote, I shared what we have been building through Varacco, ThinnkFarm, and our Smart FARM and Smart CAFE projects: that businesses can be profitable and transformative; that technology — IoT, drones, nano-biofertilizers — can be democratized for farmers; that growth can be regenerative, not extractive. Platforms like the National Business Management Conference and PAoM matter because they create space for dialogue. They allow professors, researchers, and practitioners to ask uncomfortable questions, interrogate outdated frameworks, and co-design future-ready models. Amid the complexity of our time, these spaces remind us that business can still be a force for good, if we intentionally teach it that way. Looking back, the past weeks felt like a single arc stitched across three locations: A summit hall in Manila, where young leaders gathered with clarity and conviction. A microgrid in Palawan, reminding me of what climate solutions look like when they reach the people who need them most. A conference stage in De La Salle, where I stood before academics and asked them, and myself — what kind of leaders we must nurture for the next decade. (READ: Supporting social enterprises with a purpose: Should we?) In every space, one theme emerged: courageous leadership is not about being the smartest person in the room; it is about being the most accountable to the future. Meeting Amina re-centered me on dignity. Learning from Quintin re-energized me on climate action. Seeing the brilliance of AIM graduates like Carl, Xien, and Novee reminded me that the next generation is already experimenting with the ideas that will define the Philippines’ sustainable future. And speaking to educators and scholars challenged me to imagine a business landscape where young entrepreneurs do not have to choose between profit and purpose, because the ecosystem teaches them to integrate both. I return to the question I asked at the summit: Now that you are here, what will you do with this space? For me, the answer is simple: keep building, keep convening, keep learning, and keep connecting the threads, between fellows and farmers, between energy systems and education, between research and real life. Spaces like Asia 21, Roots of Health, Sabang’s microgrid, and the national business conference are not just events; they are reminders that progress is collaborative. That no leader moves alone. That the world is held up by communities of people quietly doing the work, even when the world is not watching. And if there is anything this season has taught me, it is this: “Hope is not a feeling. It is a practice. And courageous leadership is one of its fiercest forms.” – Rappler.com Ariestelo Asilo is recently named an Asia 21 Next Generation Fellow 2025.

"MANILA, Philippines – Have you noticed how gold prices have lately been climbing almost relentlessly? Earlier in April, Goldman Sachs bumped its end-2025 target for gold to around $3,700 per troy ounce (up from $3,300 earlier). Spot gold has since surged beyond those levels, breaking $4,000 in early October and touching an intra-day record high of $4,378 on October 17. Analysts are now even floating the possibility of nearly $5,000 an ounce within the next year if current trends hold. So, is it time to start looking at gold bars as an investment? Gold often shines brightest when the world looks uncertain. Several overlapping factors are behind its latest surge. One is monetary policy. When the US Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low – or even hints that rate cuts are looming – non-yielding assets like gold tend to become more appealing. That’s because the opportunity cost of holding them (versus earning interest on bonds or deposits) decreases. Conversely, when the Fed tightens or when US Treasury yields climb, gold can lose momentum. The dollar also plays a crucial role. A weaker US dollar makes gold cheaper for investors using other currencies, stimulating global demand. But when the dollar strengthens, it usually drags gold down. In the past few months, shifting expectations about US monetary policy have caused both the dollar and gold to seesaw, sometimes in opposite directions. Beyond monetary policy, geopolitical risk has fueled gold’s safe-haven appeal. Conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, together with slowing global growth, have encouraged investors to park wealth in assets that don’t depend on governments or corporate earnings. Gold, as a tangible and universally tradable commodity, tends to thrive in moments of fear or uncertainty. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which can swing wildly, or fiat currencies that lose value through inflation, gold retains a reputation for permanence. That reputation is why it often acts as a hedge against inflation. When the cost of goods rises, so does the appeal of owning something with finite supply and intrinsic value. Central banks buy, hold, and sell gold as part of managing their reserves. Here’s how the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) explains it: “Gold prices tend to move in the opposite direction of other assets. Therefore, central banks hold some gold as a hedge against price declines in other assets in the reserves.” However, the BSP also cautioned that gold has limitations. It earns little to no interest, can be volatile, and requires storage and insurance. In September 2024, the BSP sold part of its gold holdings after the metal’s price rose beyond what it considers an “ideal ratio” of eight to ten percent of total reserves. (READ: [In This Economy] Why Filipinos shouldn’t panic over the sale of gold reserves) “Gold prices recently rose, pushing our holdings above the ideal ratio, so we sold some,” BSP Governor Eli Remolona said in March 2025, as reported by Philippine Star. The move drew criticism from some observers who argued that the BSP should have held longer, given that prices have since climbed to all-time highs. Remolona, however, dismissed the notion of market-timing. “We’re not betting on prices — we don’t claim to know if gold prices will rise or fall. Those saying we shouldn’t have sold are free to invest themselves,” he added. See, even central banks treat gold as a hedge, not a speculative bet. They hold just enough to offset risks elsewhere, not to chase profits. This point is especially important for retail investors to understand as they start to add gold into their portfolio. Across the country, there’s growing interest in owning physical gold, whether that’s in the form of coins or bars. Investors want to diversify beyond savings accounts and stocks. One notable development is the launch of the MDLR Legacy Gold Bar Collection by Mayet Dela Rosa Fine Jewelry. Perhaps better known for its jewelry pieces, the company is also now expanding into investment-grade gold bars. A post shared by Mayet De La Rosa Fine Jewelry (@mayetdelarosa) Its gold bars are crafted to international purity standards (999.9 fineness), hallmarked, serial-numbered, and authenticated by Heraeus, a global assayer. “[Gold]’s immune to the volatility of digital markets and inflationary currencies. We see it not merely as adornment, but as protection — an heirloom of security,” chief executive officer Mayet Dela Rosa said in a press release. “We’re making it easy to start small and start now, one bar at a time.” Other players are also making gold more accessible. Palawan Pawnshop, for example, also launched Palawan Gold, a coin-based gold investment product that allows customers to own 24-karat, gold-backed assets with verified weight and purity. For high-net-worth individuals, EastWest Bank has partnered with Hong Kong-based bullion firm J. Rotbart & Co. to give its Priority clients direct access to physical gold purchases. Clients with at least P2.5 million in investible funds can consult their relationship managers to acquire and store gold as part of a diversified portfolio. For ordinary investors, the key is understanding what gold can – and cannot – do for you. Gold is non-yielding, meaning it doesn’t generate periodic income like dividends or interest. Your return depends entirely on price appreciation, which can fluctuate with global conditions. As mentioned earlier, it’s best treated as a hedge or stabilizer rather than your main growth engine. When the economy is thriving and stocks or real estate are surging, gold may lag behind. Its strength lies in preservation, not performance. This is also how central banks use gold in their portfolio. Keep in mind too that gold, like any asset, is not immune to corrections. Recent market data show that gold futures traded as low as $3,937 per ounce. It’s too early to say whether this would continue into a downtrend, but that remains a possibility. Owning gold also comes with logistics. Whether you buy from a brand like Mayet Dela Rosa or through coins like Palawan Gold, you need to consider authenticity, storage, and resale. The bars and coins can be stored in tamper-proof safes or bank deposit boxes, but that means added cost and security responsibility. You’ll also want to check how easily you can liquidate the metal if needed and at what spread from market prices. For high-net-worth clients, partnerships like EastWest’s with J. Rotbart & Co. provide formalized channels for larger, insured holdings. But for most people, smaller bars or coins may make more practical entry points. Ultimately, don’t get too caught up in this global fascination with gold unless you know why you want to add it into your portfolio. Holding gold should be part of a balanced portfolio; it should be a complement to your stocks, bonds, and cash, not a replacement. If you’re looking to protect value amid uncertainty, gold offers that anchor. But don’t expect this rapid growth to continue indefinitely. Gold certainly won’t provide you with the same kind of lucrative returns as a hot tech stock. – Rappler.com Lance Spencer Yu is a former business journalist for Rappler.

"Who constructed the flood control projects that should have prevented the deaths caused by Typhoon Tino? The deadliest storm to hit the country this year, Tino and the destruction it left in its wake have sparked even more public outrage over the flood control controversy that first erupted earlier in July. Now, people are asking: Who should be held accountable? The government, at both the national and local levels, has pointed to the doubtful quality of flood control projects in the area. Here are the top flood control contractors of provinces where Tino caused the most deaths. Cebu province ranks second for most flood control projects and highest total cost of projects from 2022 to 2025. This is despite not being among the top 10 most flood-prone provinces in the country. But when Tino hit, it showed that the number and cost of these flood control projects did not equate to safety for the province. Scores of people still died, especially in the towns of Liloan, Compostela, Cebu City, Mandaue City, Danao City, Balamban, and Talisay City. So, since 2022, who built the flood control projects in these areas? In Liloan, where Tino claimed the most lives, Discaya-linked firms, in partnership with MC Geometric Proportions Inc., secured the highest total cost of contracts. These projects were supposed to prevent the Cotcot River from overflowing and flooding the surrounding land. But the waters still rose above the river’s banks, submerging the communities living downstream, as shown in a simulation released by the Cebu Provincial Capitol. Province-wide, QM Builders and Quirante Construction took the biggest slice of projects overall. Most of their projects were built to control the Mananga River in Talisay City, but a Sunstar report found that the shanties under and on the sides of the Mananga Bridge were still destroyed by the strong current. QM Builders is owned by Allan Quirante, who famously flip-flopped during a Senate probe into his company’s projects. Quirante Construction is led by Jonathan Quirante, and sources who requested anonymity told Rappler that Jonathan is Allan’s nephew. (READ: Dumanjug’s Quirante clan took nearly 1 of 4 flood control projects in Cebu) Negros Island is another area where Tino caused grave destruction, especially in Negros Occidental. From 2022 to 2025, ₱9.5 billion-worth of flood control projects were built in the area — though they failed to stop the recent typhoon from claiming several lives in the province. The Camansi and Binalbagan Rivers are located in the towns of La Castellana and Hinigaran, respectively. River control projects supposed to keep these bodies of water at bay were built by the country’s top flood control contractor: Legacy Construction Corporation. The firm is owned by Alex Abelido, who is also a prominent figure in Negros Occidental. Rappler had previously reported on his company’s flood control projects being flooded back in July. (READ: Most Negros Occidental projects of Marcos-listed top contractor flooded in July) Another report by Rappler in August found that Legacy Construction Corporation had previously received poor and unsatisfactory ratings from the Constructors’ Performance Evaluation System for road widening and drainage projects in 2020. On the other side of the island, Canlaon City in Negros Oriental was also among the hardest hit by Typhoon Tino. Data show that only one flood control project was built in the city from 2022 to 2025: a box culvert along the Vallehermoso-Canlaon City-La Castellana road constructed by Rekina Construction Services. The town had already been grappling with repeated activity from nearby Kanlaon Volcano when the typhoon struck. Before Tino made landfall, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) had already issued a warning for lahar and sediment flows. – Rappler.com",True,true,LIST: Top flood control contractors in Visayas towns where Tino was deadliest,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/visayas/list-top-flood-control-contractors-towns-typhoon-tino-deadliest/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – With his choice of an undisclosed third party country in dispute, former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte has also explored the option of being temporarily freed in the Netherlands, the host country of the International Criminal Court (ICC) where he is currently detained. “Given the Prosecution’s non-opposition to interim release to the Netherlands, Mr Duterte respectfully requests that the Pre-Trial Chamber order the Registry to invite the Netherlands to make its observations on the possibility of accommodating Mr Duterte for the term of his interim release,” said Duterte’s lead defense lawyer Nicholas Kaufman in a filing made on June 16, but publicized only on September 10. Duterte said that if the ICC pre-trial chamber approves an interim release to the Netherlands, he “would not seek asylum in the Netherlands at any future date.” Duterte has been detained at the ICC detention center in The Hague since his sensational arrest in Manila on March 11. He was flown out of a government-chartered private plane on the same day of his arrest, sanctioned by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. who said this was in keeping with the country’s commitment to the Interpol which issued the red notice following an ICC warrant. Duterte filed for an interim release request on June 12, saying that an undisclosed third party country has already agreed to enforce possible conditions that may be set by the court. But the prosecution “strongly opposed” the release to that country. So on June 16, anticipating the opposition from the prosecution, Kaufman filed the request to ask the Netherlands to comment whether it would be willing to enforce the conditions for a possible interim release to the country. Kaufman said the advance request is separate from its main request for a release to their chosen country. Kaufman said in advance that should the Netherlands agree, Duterte would still “seek another State to which he could be released once released into Dutch territory, conditional upon authorization by the Pre-Trial Chamber.” The ICC pre-trial chamber asked the Netherlands to comment on June 18, and a copy of the order was published on September 23. In that order, the chamber also asked Duterte’s choice country to also comment. “The Defense would cover any costs expended by the Host State in enforcing the terms and conditions ordered by the Pre-Trial Chamber,” said Kaufman. In their opposition filed on June 23, the prosecution said it will not agree to Duterte’s chosen country because it “does not have the same extensive history of cooperation with the Court.” Some conditions that may be set out, which Duterte has offered to follow, would be to “refrain from public engagement, office, or communications with persons outside his family” and also to “abstain from use of the internet or any electronic devices, such as a mobile phone.” Duterte has reiterated this request for an interim release, after the defense obtained a medical report from its own chosen expert that the former strongman is allegedly suffering from “deteriorating cognitive condition” and thus is physically unable to do the risk factors like intimidating witnesses and committing more crimes. Under ICC rules, if those risk factors are present, a suspect cannot be temporarily released. This new detail offers an insight as to why Kaufman was mad at Harry Roque, Duterte’s former presidential spokesperson, who suggested suing the Netherlands for being an alleged accessory to the crime they call as kidnapping Duterte. The ICC pre-trial chamber has postponed what was supposed to be the confirmation of charges hearing on September 23, pending its own determination on Duterte’s fitness to attend the hearing. It has not announced the new date. – Rappler.com",True,true,Duterte exploring option to be released to the Netherlands,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/rodrigo-duterte-explores-option-release-netherlands/,Rappler
"When Heart Evangelista received a Paraiba ring from Chiz Escudero for Valentine’s day in 2024, elated really became the only way to describe her reaction. She was all giddy, immediately slipping the glistening turquoise-colored ring onto her index finger as Chiz watched her from a distance, legs crossed, keeping a straight face while he sipped on a glass of red wine. Heart had a burning question for Chiz: “How?” Yes, how could a senator, who earns a monthly salary of between P293,191 and P334,059 (Salary Grade 31), afford to give his wife a piece of jewelry of that rarity? Let’s put it into perspective. The Paraiba tourmaline is a rare Brazilian gemstone and is regarded as one of the most expensive in the market. Jeweler Julia Chafe estimates Heart’s ring to be around five to six carats, which means that it would cost over $1 million (~P58.8 million). Of Chiz’s declared statement of assets, liabilities, and net worth (SALN) of P18.84 million, P11.7 million of that was cash — far less than the ring’s estimated value. Extravagant gift giving seems to be the couple’s love language. In 2013, Ramon Tulfo had written a column where he relayed his recorded conversations with Heart’s parents, Rey and Baby Ongpauco, who both had interesting things to say about Chiz. Baby revealed to Tulfo that when Chiz discovered that Heart wanted a particular watch that cost around P5 million, he sourced it from a Chinese supporter of his. “You know, our daughter is a spoiled brat and we buy her all the things she wants. You know what Chiz does? He gave Heart a watch which he said came from a Chinese supporter…That’s how he gives gifts to Heart: He would get them from supporters. Like that watch which costs P5 million which, he told Heart, he would pay back to the Chinese,” Baby told Tulfo. They say that couples start to look alike the more time they spend together. Sometimes, they even start to adopt each other’s quirks — just like how Chiz has developed an eye for luxury himself. When Chiz moves his arms around as he speaks in Senate hearings, it’s hard not to look at the accessory that often encases his left wrist: his high-end watches. And he’s been photographed sporting various of these. One of them, the Cartier Tank Solo XI, sold for around P200,000 on Chrono24, a luxury watch marketplace. There’s also the Rolex Cosmograph Daytona, which is listed for P917,500 on the brand’s official website. Heart had also gifted Chiz a new Rolex for their anniversary in 2022. It’s the Oyster Perpetual 41 with the mustard yellow dial, which is listed for P1.08 million on the pre-owned luxury watch site Gentry Timepieces. A post shared by Heart Evangelista (@iamhearte) In his SALN, Chiz valued his collection of “jewelry and other personal properties” at P4.95 million. It would seem to add up at first, until you find out about his Patek Philippe Nautilus 5711/1A-011 watch with a white dial, which costs between P6 million and P8 million on Chrono24. It isn’t just his watches, but the clothes he wears on his back, too, when he’s not dressed in the required tropical fabrics. In one of Heart’s 2024 vlogs, Chiz roams the streets of Paris donning a black Louis Vuitton x Yayoi Kusama jacket. It’s listed at a discounted price of $2,607 (~P153,317.67) on Vestiaire Collective, an online marketplace for pre-owned luxury goods. Imagine if it’s not at all discounted. Even his suits are designer. In 2023, Chiz accompanied Heart to the GMA Gala, where he wore a black made to measure Dior suit that the socialite had chosen and bought herself. “Ako pumili n’yan at ako rin ang nag-shopping n’yan dahil pinilit ko siya (I chose that and went shopping for that because I forced him). It’s a beautiful suit from the iconic Dior,” Heart said in an interview with GMA on the sidelines of the gala. A post shared by Sparkle GMA Artist Center (@sparklegmaartistcenter) When the couple renewed their wedding vows in 2024, Heart was wearing a fully-embroidered, sand-colored custom Elie Saab dress, for which she had flown to Paris to fit, as documented in one of her vlogs. She then slipped into a fully beaded Michael Levya gown during the reception. Chiz, meanwhile, was in an all-white made to measure Dior suit. A post shared by Pat Dy (@patdy11) The luxury brand’s made to measure couture suits can easily cost between $12,000 to $20,000 (P706,320 to P1,177,200), depending on customizations, according to another Dior couture client. To get these tailor-made suits, one would need to set an appointment at one of Dior’s select boutiques — none of which are located in the Philippines. Chiz would have had to fly to one of these countries or cities to ensure that the whole ensemble would fit perfectly: Tokyo, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Paris, Dubai, New York, Miami, Milan, or London. But exorbitance seems to lie in the foundation of their marriage. Chiz and Heart wed in the exclusive Balesin Island, owned by Roberto Ongpin’s Alphaland. The senator revealed that it was Balesin that had sponsored their wedding proper, and most of the other aspects of the ceremony had also been paid for by other “sponsors,” like their rings. Questioned by Karen Davila if Ongpin’s sponsoring of their wedding would count as a conflict of interest as the late mogul had several cases against him then, Chiz calmly answered that most of his wedding sponsors had cases against them anyway. “Karamihan naman ng mga sponsors sa kasal, ‘yung may pangalan, palaging may kaso. Isa na siya ‘ron. Halos lahat yata ng sponsors sa wedding namin may kaso,” he said. (Most of our wedding sponsors, the big names, always have cases. [Ongpin] is one of them. Almost all our wedding sponsors have cases.) Chiz denied there being any sort of conflict of interest. “Sibil man o sa negosyo man, wala naman sigurong kasong kriminal, pero ang conflict of interest papasok lamang ‘pag ginamit mo ang pangalan at puwesto mo para tulungan siya. Wala akong ginagawang gano’n,” he added. (Whether it’s a civil case or a business case, I don’t think there’s a criminal case, but it only becomes a conflict of interest when you use your name and position to help them. I don’t do anything like that.) The statements of Heart’s father, Rey, however, suggested otherwise. “Bobby Ongpin backs him up (financially). Heart wanted a (house) trailer, Chiz said for her not to buy it because he would give it to her as a gift. Bobby Ongpin would give it to him as a Christmas gift,” Tulfo quoted Rey in his column. And even though Chiz and Heart have a prenuptial agreement that gives each of them complete ownership of their own assets, Manolo Quezon still said it best: “The moment comes when luxury is seen as filthy, when celebrity becomes suspect, and lifestyle becomes an accessory to the crime, because your Instagrammable moment comes at the expense of the people.” The question still stands: How could the “poorest senator” be living a not-so-concealed life of luxury? – Rappler.com",True,true,"Chiz Escudero, Heart Evangelista: Extravagance as love language",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/chiz-escudero-heart-evangelista-extravagance-love-language/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Lopez family’s property firm Rockwell Land Corporation (Rockwell Land) bought a nearly 75% stake in Alabang Town Center from the Madrigal family for P21.6 billion. In a disclosure late Monday, December 22, Rockwell Land said it had acquired 75% of Alabang Commercial Corporation (ACC), the company that owns Alabang Town Center, from the Madrigals led by real estate developer Francisco Madrigal Bayot, a grandson of former senator and industrialist Vicente Madrigal. “Earlier this year, Mr. Francisco ‘Jun’ M. Bayot invited us to consider redeveloping Alabang Town Center. It presented a compelling opportunity for Rockwell Land to further expand our presence in the south of Metro Manila, particularly given the scale and long-term potential of the property,” Rockwell Land chairman and CEO Nestor Padilla said in a press release on Monday. “We are very grateful to Mr. Bayot and the Madrigal family for this opportunity. Our immediate focus is on ensuring a smooth transition and planning its redevelopment,” he added. Other shareholders of ACC who were part of the share purchase agreement are: Rockwell Land will pay ACC P21.6 billion in three equal installments every December over the next three years. The purchase was announced six days after Ayala Land Incorporated disclosed that it had sold its 50% ownership of Alabang Commercial Center to the Madrigal family for P13.5 billion. The 17.5-hectare Alabang Town Center is a pioneer mall in Muntinlupa City that was developed by the Ayala Group under a joint venture with the Madrigal family. It currently has around 500 retail and office tenants. The purchase gives Rockwell Land the “opportunity to expand its footprint in a prime location with long-term redevelopment opportunities,” the company said. It adds 137,000 square meters of gross leasable area to Rockwell’s existing retail and office portfolio. Rockwell’s most famous project that symbolizes its target premium market is Rockwell Center Makati, home to some of the big names in Philippine business. Its Power Plant Mall is considered a premium retail and lifestyle destination, which is being replicated in other cities. A post shared by Power Plant Mall (@powerplantmall) “Over the years, the company has enhanced its retail developments by integrating experiential and lifestyle-oriented spaces into its masterplanning, supported by curated tenant mixes. These efforts have enabled Rockwell Land to establish a strong track record in delivering a high-end retail experience,” Rockwell Land said. The company also said that the purchase builds on Rockwell’s other retail expansion projects such as the Power Plant Nepo in Angeles City Pampanga; new retail spaces within Rockwell at IPI Center in Cebu City; and the Power Plant Mall Bacolod in Rockwell Center Bacolod. Rockwell’s main business is residential development of high-rise condominiums that cater to high-end buyers. Federico “Piki” Lopez has been vice-chairman of Rockwell Land since 2012. He is chairman and CEO of Lopez firms First Philippine Holdings, First Gen Corporation, and Energy Development Corporation. Last February, debt-saddled Lopez media and entertainment firm ABS-CBN Corporation sold 30,000 square meters of its 44,027-sqm-property in Sgt. Esguerra, Quezon City, to Ayala Land for P6.2 billion, allowing it to pay its outstanding bank loans. – Rappler.com",True,true,Lopez family’s Rockwell buys Alabang Town Center from Madrigals for P21.6 billion,https://www.rappler.com/business/rockwell-land-buys-alabang-town-center-madrigal-family/,Rappler
"In Hong Kong’s lively food scene, you’ll find everything from street food to fine dining. Look around the bustling streets of any major district, and it’s the hawker stalls that will immediately fill your periphery. Wander a little further, and you’ll find higher-end establishments tucked into tall buildings, all of which offer a charm of their own. It doesn’t really come as a surprise when people say they booked a trip to Hong Kong just to eat, because everyone has a dish they’d kill to taste right on its soil — whether it’s egg tarts or char siu. The bottom line is that the Fragrant Harbour isn’t referred to as a culinary capital for no reason. Meet Alvin Leung and Aven Lau, the chefs behind two of Hong Kong’s Michelin-starred restaurants: Bo Innovation and Épure. Despite their contrasting philosophies in the kitchen, the pair finds similarities in bringing Hong Kong’s dining scene to new heights. At the core of Alvin Leung’s world is being able to stand out from the get-go. That’s how it’s always been for the acclaimed 64-year-old chef, who’s at the helm of Wan Chai’s Cafe Bau and the two-Michelin-starred Bo Innovation in the Central district, among others. “No. I’m still an attention seeker,” the MasterChef Canada judge immediately answered when asked if his own views on food have changed over the years. “I like to be unique. I like to do things that nobody has done, go to places nobody has gone. So, even in my TV shows, I like to do something that is probably less mainstream. That’s always been my character, just to be different. I don’t think that has changed,” he continued. It wasn’t difficult to understand what Leung was talking about. During the 2025 Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival, under Bo Innovation, he lined up a menu of reimagined versions of Hong Kong’s most iconic dishes, which really drove his point home and became a rather glaring indication of his roots as an engineer by profession. Just take the Molecular X-treme Xiao Long Bao for example. Taking on the colors of bright red and pink, it’s perfectly round and smooth, free of the creases the soup dumpling usually has. But it still gives you the classic xiao long bao experience anyone would look for: when you take a bite off the edge of the wrapper, a small wave of hot broth washes over your mouth before you get to the bits of ground pork. There’s also the Lao Po Bing (wife cake), which is typically round, flat, and stuffed with wintermelon filling. Leung’s version, however, merges the modern with the traditional. He deconstructs the cake and adds two new layers to the mix: a scoop of ice cream and a thin meringue disc. The bottom layers, which serve as the entire dish’s foundation, stay true to the chewy filling and usual flaky texture of the famed dessert. These dishes still taste familiar at the end of the day, just presented in ways you wouldn’t think of. Perhaps it’s the London-born chef’s way of keeping up with the dynamic culinary industry while still paying homage to the classics people love. Leung believes the latter is exactly why people should come to Hong Kong in the first place. “No,” Leung replied when asked if there’s any aspect of the local cuisine he feels needs to be highlighted more. “I think we have such a variety in Hong Kong. We cover every aspect around the world. I really think that people, when they come to Hong Kong, should attempt to go for something unique to [it].” For Aven Lau, meanwhile, intersections seem to be a major part of his body of work in more ways than one. The Singaporean chef runs the show at the one-Michelin-starred Épure, where he cooks contemporary French food at Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbourfront. All these different cultures and cuisines have essentially become a part of who he is as a chef, with his Singaporean identity laying the groundwork for it all and Hong Kong serving as the backdrop for his culinary growth. Traces of his adolescence have even found their way back to a later point in his timeline as a professional chef. Years ago, Lau thought of recreating a quail dish he tried when he was dining out with his family during his youth, showing that it’s the mundane, fleeting experiences we often remember most. “I didn’t grow up in a family where they were very focused on food. Like, we were just eating at street-side stalls. There was once, my parents decided to celebrate, and they brought me to this Middle Eastern restaurant. And they ordered this smoked chicken. At that age, that was the best chicken I had because it was the first time I tasted something that smoky. So, that made me want to recreate a poultry dish,” he told Rappler. Lau stressed, though, that every year, he cooks differently. What he created three years ago likely won’t be the same thing he’ll cook three more years down the line. He attested that he isn’t one to follow trends but is instead always looking to evolve. It’s a paradox, really — what will never change with Lau is his chase for constant transformation. “I think that’s the most important, it’s that constant evolution. If you’re not evolving, you’re stuck in the past, right? I think the whole point about [being] a chef is about finding your own identity,” he said. And it’s reflected in what he serves at Épure. One of these is the aged rice duck “a l’orange” with aged tangerine peel and timut pepper, which has become a staple at the establishment. These ducks are sourced from China’s Guangdong province and baked in the oven until the skin becomes crispy. The timut pepper sauce is then poured over the slices of duck to even it all out. But what really ties it all together are the oranges being swapped out for tangerines. This, Lau said, gives the French dish a distinct Asian flair. The chocolate soufflé tart, meanwhile, is light, fluffy, and has the very level of good bitterness you would look for in any cacao-based dessert after having a series of savory mains. While Épure is a French restaurant on paper, Lau still makes it a point to incorporate semblances of his own lived experiences into whatever he cooks in the kitchen, allowing him to create dishes he can truly call his own. It all circles back to what he deems important as a chef: finding your own identity. Both these chefs are helping push Hong Kong’s dining scene forward in their own ways — Leung doing so as he gets a thrill out of refashioning classics, and Lau following suit as he injects elements from his own heritage into French cuisine. It’s no wonder, then, how Hong Kong earned its reputation as a renowned culinary destination. – Rappler.com",True,true,How these chefs push Hong Kong’s food scene forward with innovation and identity,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/scene-hong-kong-chefs-innovation-identity/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Allowances for public health workers (PHWs) are subject to other conditions, the Commission on Audit emphasized as it affirmed with finality its January 31, 2020 decision upholding the notice of disallowance (ND) it issued to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth). The ND came after PhilHealth gave its employees cash perks — hazard pay, subsistence allowance, and laundry allowance — totaling P95.462 million in 2014. The state insurer sought to have its ND lifted. Jose Mari Tolentino, senior vice president of PhilHealth’s legal sector, said the Supreme Court classified the state insurer’s personnel as PHWs and are therefore entitled to certain cash perks under the National Health Insurance Act (RA No. 7875). However, PhilHealth’s motion for reconsideration was denied by COA last week, with the Commission saying the state insurer was merely rehashing old arguments that have already been considered and overruled. “It is the consistent position of this Commission that even if they are PHWs, the entitlement to the benefits is not absolute as it is subject to the other conditions under RA No. 7305 or the Magna Carta of PHWs and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR),” the 15-page COA ruling read. For a PHW to qualify for hazard pay, they must be assigned in hospitals or health facilities that handle contagious or communicable diseased, working within radiation-exposed areas, chemical and medical laboratories working on infectious specimen, conflict zones, or correction and drug rehabilitation centers where there may be risks of physical harm. Subsistence allowance, meanwhile, is only given to PHWs who are on-call “at any and all times” while assigned to a government hospital or any government institution. “The [High] Court has previously discussed that the award of WESA (welfare support allowance) or subsistence allowance is not a blanket award to PHWs and that it is granted only to those who meet the requirements of RA No. 7305 and its IRR, and thus, a sweeping grant of the same justifies its disallowance,” the Commission said. Meanwhile, laundry allowance is only given to PHWs who work in health-related establishments. – Rappler.com",True,true,COA: Allowances for public health workers are subject to conditions,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/coa-allowances-public-health-workers-subject-conditions/,Rappler
"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia – China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) signed an upgrade to their free trade agreement on Tuesday, October 28, with leaders hailing the deal which spans the digital and green economy, and other new industries. The 11-member ASEAN is China’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totaling $771 billion last year, according to ASEAN statistics. China is seeking to intensify its engagement with ASEAN, a region with a collective gross domestic product of $3.8 trillion, to counter hefty import tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump’s administration on countries around the world. “We must accelerate trade and investment liberalization and facilitation and strengthen industrial integration and interdependence,” Chinese Premier Li Qiang said at the ASEAN leaders’ meeting on Tuesday. Beijing has been seeking to position itself as a more open economy, despite criticism from other major powers of its expanding export restrictions on rare earths and other critical minerals. The so-called 3.0 version of the free trade agreement between ASEAN and China was signed into effect at a summit of the bloc’s leaders in Malaysia, which Trump attended on Sunday, October 26, at the start of a trip through Asia. Negotiations on the upgraded ASEAN-China deal began in November 2022 and concluded in May this year, just after Trump’s tariff offensive kicked into gear. The first FTA came into force in 2010. “The upgrade will further reduce trade barriers, strengthen supply chain connectivity, and unlock opportunities in future growth areas,” Singapore’s Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said. China has previously said the agreement would pave the way for improved market access in sectors such as agriculture, the digital economy, and pharmaceuticals between China and ASEAN. Both China and ASEAN are part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world’s largest trading bloc, which covers nearly a third of the global population and about 30% of global gross domestic product. Malaysia hosted an RCEP summit in Kuala Lumpur on Monday, October 27, the first in five years. The bloc is seen by some analysts as a potential buffer against tariffs imposed by the United States, though its provisions are considered weaker than some other regional trade deals due to competing interests among its members. Standing in the way of China taking a leading role in regional trade cooperation are heightened concerns around Beijing’s military ambitions. On Monday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. criticized Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, where the two countries have been engaged in a series of confrontations. Beijing’s foreign office responded to Marcos’ statement by saying the clashes were due to provocation from Manila. China claims almost the entire resource-rich waterway on its official maps, overlapping with parts of the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Unresolved disputes have festered for years over ownership of multiple islands and features. “We must strengthen strategic mutual trust,” Li said in his Tuesday address. “We must accelerate consultations on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea and strive for an early conclusion.” Wong also raised the flashpoint as a key diplomatic issue. “Inevitably, there will be differences of views around the South China Sea, but all of us agree that peace, stability, safety, and freedom of navigation and overflight, are critical in this important waterway.” China has been engaged in an escalating trade war with the United States since Trump took office in January and imposed steep tariffs on Chinese goods. Beijing has labeled Trump’s tariffs, which have hit most countries, as protectionism, while expanding its controls over the flow of its critical minerals and magnets. China processes more than 90% of the world’s rare earths. The world’s two largest economies extended a trade truce when negotiators met in Kuala Lumpur on the weekend, hashing out an agreement for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to decide later this week when they meet in Seoul. Since Trump departed Malaysia on Monday morning, China has pressed for increased economic cooperation in the region, stressing the importance of open trade. “The world must not slip back to the law of the jungle where the strong prey on the weak,” Premier Li said at a different event on Monday. “We should more firmly uphold the free trade regime, create a high-standard regional free trade network, and vigorously and effectively advance regional integration.” – Rappler.com",True,true,"China and ASEAN, hit by US tariffs, sign upgraded free trade pact",https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/asean-china-free-trade-area-upgrade-signing-2025/,Rappler
"The Philippine stock market is sending a troubling signal: profitability no longer commands a premium. Some of the country’s most profitable publicly listed companies — GT Capital, LT Group, DMCI Holdings, Aboitiz Equity Ventures, and Semirara Mining & Power — are generating tens of billions of pesos in annual earnings yet trade at valuation multiples that imply permanent decline. Discounted by conglomerate structure, cyclicality, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) discomfort, or sheer narrative fatigue, these firms reveal a deeper market inefficiency: the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) is no longer rewarding cash flow, balance-sheet discipline, or dividend capacity. In sidelining companies that already deliver real, audited profits, the market is mistaking storytelling for value — and creating a widening gap between financial performance and stock price that long-term investors ignore at their own risk. In efficient markets, profitability is supposed to be the ultimate referee. Cash flows validate strategy; earnings discipline excess. Yet the Philippine equity market has quietly inverted that logic. Today, some of the country’s most profitable publicly listed companies trade as if profits were incidental — nice to have, but not worth paying for. The result is a growing disconnect between corporate performance and market valuation that deserves closer scrutiny. Consider LT Group, a company that quietly generated close to ₱29 billion in net income in 2024 across banking, distilled spirits, tobacco, and property. By any global standard, that is real money — recurring, diversified, and cash-generative. Yet, the stock trades at valuation multiples more typical of a distressed cyclical business. The market’s discount appears less about earnings durability and more about narrative fatigue: a conglomerate structure, regulatory exposure, and the absence of a fashionable growth story. What is missing in that narrative is that LT Group’s profits are not speculative — they are already realized, taxed, and available for dividends or reinvestment. The same paradox defines GT Capital. With nearly ₱29 billion in attributable net income in 2024, GT Capital sits atop some of the most strategically important franchises in the country, from banking to automotive. Yet, it trades at a holding-company discount so steep that the market seems to be pricing in permanent stagnation. Investors talk endlessly about optionality and disruption, but ignore the embedded value of scale, capital discipline, and dominant market positions. The irony is that GT Capital’s earnings are precisely the kind that compound quietly over time — steady, resilient, and inflation-protective — but the market assigns them little premium. (READ: Toyota Motor Philippines sets new sales record as PH middle class expands) DMCI Holdings offers another illustration of this profit paradox. In 2024, DMCI delivered about ₱19 billion in net income, underpinned by construction, power, mining, and property. The market, however, continues to treat DMCI as if its earnings are perpetually one downturn away from collapse. Commodity exposure and infrastructure cyclicality dominate investor perception, even as the company continues to throw off cash and pay generous dividends. Cyclicality is predictable patterns (ups and downs) that certain industries, stocks, and economic factors follow in sync with the overall business cycle. What the market misses is that DMCI has already internalized cyclicality into its capital allocation model. Its profits are not accidental; they are engineered through conservative leverage, project discipline, and a willingness to sit out bad cycles. Then there is Aboitiz Equity Ventures (AEV), a name synonymous with operational competence and long-term capital stewardship. With over ₱18 billion in net income in 2024, AEV remains a pillar of Philippine corporate profitability. Yet, its valuation suggests that investors are more focused on near-term capital expenditures and sector rotation than on normalized earnings power. Power generation transitions, banking exposure, and infrastructure investments are framed as risks rather than as platforms for durable cash flows. The market, in effect, is penalizing AEV for investing for the future — even though those investments are funded by existing profitability. Finally, Semirara Mining & Power exemplifies how ideology can overwhelm arithmetic. Despite generating nearly ₱10 billion in net income in 2024, Semirara trades as though its profits are morally obsolete. ESG concerns, coal aversion, and energy-transition narratives dominate the discourse, pushing valuation multiples down, regardless of actual cash generation. Multiple is a valuation ratio comparing a company’s market value to a key financial metric (like earnings or sales) to assess if it’s overvalued or undervalued relative to peers. What is often overlooked is that Semirara’s profits are financing dividends, balance-sheet strength, and — ironically — parts of the energy transition itself. Markets may dislike coal, but coal cash still spends. How these hypothetical targets are constructed: These are illustrative, not precise price forecasts. They are meant to show what happens if the market ever starts to reward profitability the way it has historically. Disclaimer: Although illustrative, they are not investment advice. They don’t forecast share prices into the future based on company guidance or consensus earnings growth. They are based on simple valuation re-rating logic and publicly available market prices and multiples. Viewed together, these companies expose a deeper issue in Philippine equities: profitability has lost its signaling power. The market is not asking, “How much money does this company make?” but rather, “Does this story fit the current investment fashion?” Conglomerates are dismissed as inefficient by default. Cyclicals are treated as uninvestable. Transition industries are discounted before transitions are even completed. In that environment, earnings — actual, audited, distributable earnings — are treated as backward-looking trivia. Vantage Point views this not merely a valuation anomaly; it is a behavioral one. Investors have become so conditioned to chase growth narratives and thematic purity that they undervalue what profitability truly represents: proof of execution. Profits mean a business has survived competition, regulation, labor costs, and capital constraints —and still delivered surplus value. Ignoring that is not sophistication; it is selective blindness. For long-term investors, this disconnect may be precisely where opportunity lies. Markets can stay enamored with stories longer than expected, but they rarely ignore cash forever. When sentiment eventually rotates — toward dividends, balance-sheet strength, or simple earnings yield — the companies already doing the hard work of generating profits will not need to reinvent themselves. They will simply be re-rated. In the end, the Philippine market’s greatest inefficiency today may not be mispricing risk. It may be mispricing success. Below is Vantage Point’s tight, investor-grade “Ignored Value” league table that formalizes what I’ve been arguing narratively. Methodology (simple, transparent): Each company is scored 1–5 (best) across four dimensions, then ranked by Total Score (max 20). This is absolutely a market-mispricing table — measuring how much profitability the market is failing to reward. PSE “Ignored Value” League Table (FY2024) 1) GT Capital — The market’s cleanest blind spot GT Capital ranks #1 not because it is the fastest grower, but because it combines scale with the deepest valuation discount. A sub-5x earnings multiple for a holding company anchored on systemically important banking and dominant automotive franchises is plainly dismissal. This is the purest example of profit without prestige, and therefore the most mispriced. 2) LT Group — Large, real, and persistently ignored LTG earns almost as much as GT Capital but trades like a regulatory accident waiting to happen. The market conflates complexity with fragility. Banking, alcohol, and tobacco are treated as permanent overhangs, even though they are precisely the sources of LTG’s stable cash flow. The result: profits that are recognized in financial statements but discounted in share price. 3) DMCI — Dividend reality vs narrative risk DMCI’s valuation reflects a market that refuses to believe that cyclicals can be well-run. Its high-dividend yield props up its score, even as investors insist on treating the company as ex-growth. The irony is that DMCI has institutionalized cyclicality into its business model — yet still gets priced as if every cycle is terminal. 4) Aboitiz Equity Ventures — Penalized for investing AEV is not cheap in the crude sense, but it is cheap relative to the earnings it already produces. Power transition risk, capital expenditure (CapEx) cycles, and banking exposure weigh on sentiment. The market is effectively discounting future profits before they even arrive — despite the fact that those investments are funded by current profitability. 5) Semirara — Profits that offend the narrative Semirara scores lower on balance-sheet risk, not because it is weak, but because its earnings are politically and ideologically inconvenient. Coal exposure ensures a structural discount regardless of payout strength. Yet, from a pure capital-return standpoint, Semirara is one of the most shareholder-friendly names on the PSE. Across all five companies, the pattern is unmistakable: I believe that this is no longer stock-picking anomaly, but rather a market-wide valuation bias. In mature markets, companies this profitable would anchor pension portfolios. In the Philippines, they are treated as intellectually unfashionable. That disconnect is precisely what long-term capital is supposed to exploit. If and when the PSE rediscovers the basic principle that earnings are not optional, this “ignored value” basket will not need better stories. It will only need the market to remember how to count. – Rappler.com Click here for more Vantage Point articles.",True,true,Vantage Point’s top 5 undervalued Philippine publicly listed companies,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-top-undervalued-philippine-publicly-listed-companies/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Velvety hot chocolate and golden churros from Madrid’s world-famous chocolatería are coming our way! Chocolatería San Ginés, the renowned Spanish culinary institution, is set to open its first historic Philippine store in February 2026, making it the first Asia flagship in the Philippines. Currently, it only has branches in Europe and the United States. Pedro Trapote, founder of San Ginés, said that bringing the brand to the Philippines is about more than food — “it’s about sharing a piece of Madrid’s cultural soul with Manila.” The Asia flagship branch will carry Spain’s rich heritage through its traditional interiors, a “warm and welcoming atmosphere,” and its signature menu. Filipinos can expect more than the famous churros con chocolate (thick hot chocolate and crispy fried churros) as the Philippine branch will also feature a Spanish-style cafeteria serving authentic dishes such as paella, tapas, and tortilla; brunch favorites like pan con tomate with jamón and chorizo and fried egg rice bowls; as well as San Ginés chocolate cake and Spanish pastries like napolitana and caña. San Ginés has been around for 130 years, gaining international acclaim after being patronized by locals, royalty, politicians, athletes, and celebrities from all over the world — from Jimmy Carter and Julio Iglesias to Naomi Campbell, Dua Lipa, and Diego Maradona, to name a few. Founded in 1894 in a narrow passage between Puerta del Sol and the Teatro Real, San Ginés began as a humble café before becoming one of Madrid’s most iconic landmarks. Hailed by online media as having “the world’s best churros,” thousands of visitors line up each day to dip their golden-brown churros in hot chocolate. The family-owned venture has since expanded across Madrid and Marbella, Lisbon, Miami, Austin, and Buenos Aires.

"PARIS, France – Hermes designer Nadege Vanhee sent out a collection of brassiere tops, quilted silk coats and racer-backed dresses for the French fashion house’s spring/summer runway show on Saturday, October 4. Guests walked in from the blustery streets to find a beige set, lined with benches, the floor covered in sand and bits of broken shells. Models marched around the space in tall riding boots, their silky ponytails swishing. They wore sandy-colored shirts, skirts and brassiere ensembles, cinched snugly with leather straps and lacework. Racerbacks revealed shoulderblades, while leather bra tops held silk fabric in place, covering the chest. The color palette was dominated by muted beige and khaki tones, with a few touches of bright red — a leather trouser set, a handbag and motifs on scarves. Hermes has outperformed rival luxury groups like LVMH, Kering, and Chanel as the sector grapples with a prolonged downturn. Dozens of brands including Dior, Chanel and Gucci have brought on new designers to try to reignite sales. At Hermes, Vanhee, who heads womenswear designs, has held her position for over a decade.

"MANILA, Philippines – Inflation accelerated for the second straight month to 1.7% in September from 1.5% in August due to higher fuel and vegetable prices, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Tuesday, October 7. This puts the country’s average inflation rate for 2025 also at 1.7%, still below the government’s target range of 2% to 4%. Transport was the main driver of September inflation, posting 1% during that month from -0.3% in August due to rising gasoline and diesel prices. Another factor was the uptick in food and non-alcoholic beverages (1% in September from 0.9% in August), particularly vegetables (19.4% from 10%) and cereals (-11.5% from -12%). Rice inflation, which falls under cereals, also climbed slightly to -16.9% from a record low of -17%. National Statistician Dennis Mapa explained that the increase was not unexpected given the reported agricultural losses caused by the recent tropical cyclones that hit the country. “We really saw that the rain and floods affected our vegetable-producing provinces, so this had an impact in August and September,” he said in Filipino. According to a bulletin from the Department of Agriculture (DA) dated September 27, tropical cyclones Mirasol, Nando (Ragasa), and Opong (Bualoi) have caused at least P1.38 billion in damage to agriculture. About 55,600 farmers and agricultural workers were also affected. A 60-day rice import ban had taken effect on September 1, which was later extended until the end of the year. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. earlier said the ban would protect the income of local farmers amid the harvest season and adequate stocks of the staple grain. In Metro Manila, inflation cooled to 2.7% from 2.9% in August as inflation of meat and vegetable prices slowed. Fruit and nut prices also continued to deflate to -6.6% from -0.8%. In contrast, inflation in areas outside Metro Manila accelerated to 1.5% from 1.1% the month before. Central Visayas recorded the highest inflation at 4.1%, while the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao had the lowest at 1.5%. Department of Economy, Planning, and Development Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said on Tuesday that the uptick in the country’s latest consumer price index reflects the sensitivity of domestic food prices to supply disruptions. The country’s socioeconomic planning chief also vowed to boost the rice sector’s productivity and competitiveness to stabilize farmers’ income in the long term. “This requires addressing constraints from fragmented farmlands, investing in research and modern technologies, improving post-harvest and marketing systems, and expanding farmers’ access to credit, insurance, and institutional support. These steps will help farmers better adapt to market shifts and climate risks,” he said. Balisacan had also said in a press conference on Monday, October 6, that the government’s target inflation range is still within reach. “While there may be some increase in inflation…we don’t expect that to breach the lower range of the inflation target,” he said. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas earlier forecast inflation in September would settle between 1.5% and 2.3%. – with reports from Arriane dela Cruz/Rappler.com Arriane dela Cruz is a Rappler intern.

"LONDON, United Kingdom – At Plates, the first vegan restaurant in Britain to earn a coveted Michelin star, the tables are packed – but not with vegans. About 95% of diners still eat meat or fish elsewhere, chef-owner Kirk Haworth says, proof that plant-based fine dining is breaking out of its niche. Haworth, who co-founded Plates in London with his sister, avoids the “vegan” label. He wants diners to judge dishes on taste, not ideology. “I always say we’re a fine dining restaurant. I don’t say that we’re vegan,” Haworth told Reuters, in his restaurant’s softly lit dining room. “Food should be judged on flavor,” he added, recalling a guest who declared himself “a changed man” halfway through dinner. Plates became the first plant-based restaurant in Britain to earn a Michelin star earlier this year, a milestone Haworth says reflects a shift in how chefs and critics view vegetables. He dismisses any notion that this is a passing fad. Britain’s vegan population is still small — about 3% of adults — but curiosity is growing. Michelin praises Plates for its “earthy, natural vibe” and inventive and inviting dishes that give vegetables the respect they deserve. Haworth’s approach is rooted in personal experience. Trained in Michelin-starred kitchens worldwide, he was forced to rethink his diet after being diagnosed with Lyme disease more than a decade ago. Bedridden for months, he began cooking without meat, dairy or refined sugar to manage chronic inflammation. That experiment became Plates, which opened 18 months ago after years of pop-ups. Today, the restaurant is fully booked until the end of March. “We’re not trying to replace meat or make things look like fish,” Haworth said. “We showcase acidity, umami, and layers that make the palate feel alive.” Despite the Michelin accolade, Haworth has no plans to expand. Instead, he aims to refine the experience and, perhaps, earn a second star. “The process is the most fun part,” he said with a smile. – Rappler.com",True,true,"At Britain’s first plant-based Michelin-star restaurant, most diners aren’t vegan",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/britain-plant-based-michelin-star-restaurant-diners-not-vegan/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – South Korean author Baek Se-hee, known for her memoir I Want to Die But I Want to Eat Tteokbokki, died on Friday, October 17. She was 35. Her cause of her death has not been made public yet. The Korea Herald reported that Baek donated five organs — her heart, lungs, liver, and both kidneys — according to the Korean Organ Donation Agency. The organs were received at the National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital in Gyeonggi Province, near her birthplace. Baek was best known for her international bestselling memoir I Want to Die But I Want to Eat Tteokbokki as it explored her struggles with dysthymia through conversations with her psychiatrist. Dysthymia is a long form of depression, also called persistent depressive disorder. She also published the sequel I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki and continued tackling mental health topics. Through her writing, she played a role in opening conversations about mental health and bringing these to a wider audience. According to The Straits Times, Baek’s works have been translated into 25 languages. Copies of her books have been sold worldwide, including the Philippines. Anton Hur, who translated Baek’s books into English, also paid tribute, saying “her readers will know she touched yet millions of lives more with her writing.” Baek Se-hee was a creative writing graduate and worked at a publishing house.

"CEBU, Philippines – Cebu’s grandest festival is back again for 2026 and is expected to bring in thousands of participants from around the country to the heart of the province, Cebu City. This year’s Sinulog festival will carry the theme, “United in Faith and Love” with the traditional tagline “One Beat, One Dance, One Vision.” The yearly celebration consists of a series of merrymaking activities like street parades, pageants, and dance competitions. The whole event is done in tandem with the Fiesta Señor celebration, which is in honor of the Child Jesus, during the month of January. “What awaits is more than a festival. It’s a wave of passion, culture, and community ready to sweep across Cebu once more,” the Sinulog Foundation Incorporated (SFI), the festival’s organizer, wrote in a social media post on December 3, 2025. Cebu City Councilor Dave Tumulak, one of the SFI’s executive committee members, told Rappler on Friday, January 2, that the entire budget for the celebration is P90 million. The official opening of the celebration will be held on January 9. On that day, an opening salvo mass will be held at the Basilica Minore del Santo Niño de Cebu at 2:30 pm. The launching parade will take place from the basilica to the Fuente Osmeña Circle and then to the Cebu City Sports Center (CCSC), where the launching program will be conducted. The grand parade and main festival day will happen on January 18 at the CCSC. There will be two ticket options for those interested in watching the event from the venue: Gen Ad Green and Gen Ad Yellow. For P1,500, attendees can get the Gen Ad Green ticket that offers priority seating closer to the center of the CCSC’s grandstand or spectator seating area. For P1,000, attendees can get the Gen Ad Yellow ticket that still provides them with the main view of the event while seated farther from the center of the grandstand.

"MANILA, Philippines – The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) on Thursday, October 9, slashed the country’s policy rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to 4.75%. The monetary authority cited its dampened outlook on economic growth in light of issues tied to government infrastructure spending. “The stock market has declined, and there are now fewer companies with expansion plans. Weaker growth means weaker demand and lower inflation,” explained BSP Governor Eli Remolona Jr. With the controversy surrounding anomalous flood control projects weighing on business sentiment, Remolona said the BSP needed to recalibrate its estimated Goldilocks rate for sustainable economic growth. “We believe it could be lower than before, giving us more room to reduce the policy rate,” he said. Remolona even said that the corruption in infrastructure spending could be the reason why the Philippines has not been meeting its economic growth forecasts. “We’ve been making the assumption that we would be growing at 6%…. It turned out to be lower than that, and now we know why,” the central bank chief said. “So the reason we were underperforming is, I think, in large part because of the governance issues related to infrastructure spending.” The adjustments in the BSP’s models allow for a more accommodating policy stance. While the Monetary Board has yet to decide on the exact “sweet spot” for economic growth, Remolona said they are looking at a policy rate between 4% and 5%. Interest rates are one of the central bank’s tools to control inflation. Central banks around the world usually cut interest rates to make borrowing costs cheaper and encourage spending. Remolona also vowed further reforms in the banking system after a government contractor said she was able to withdraw nearly half a billion pesos from a branch of the Land Bank of the Philippines in just two days. Remolona said the transfer was legitimate since the cash came from the Treasury, and was released in accordance with the General Appropriations Act. But he added that the BSP will be taking a closer look at processes in general. “It was their own money, in principle, and they were withdrawing their own money. As a bank, how do you say no to that? You can’t say it’s corruption, so now we’re taking that decision out of their hands. We’re going to figure out when the banks can actually refuse based on suspicion of corruption,” he explained. Aside from the P500,000 cap on large-value cash transactions, Remolona said the BSP is also looking at implementing a threshold for transfers in general, whether physical or digital. “We’re making it mandatory for banks, for example, to file a suspicious transactions report for certain thresholds. This report is very detailed. They have to look at whether the withdrawals or the movement of funds is disproportionate to what the depositor does, what the depositor earns,” he said. “So, there are things like that, that the banks have to look at, and then refuse to transfer the funds.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Bangko Sentral trims key rate to 4.75% as infra woes dampen business confidence,https://www.rappler.com/business/bangko-sentral-pilipinas-monetary-policy-interest-rates-october-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The newly activated Bifrost subsea internet cable system is expected to bolster the Philippines’ international connectivity and internet resilience, while driving down bandwidth costs, according to Grace Mirandilla-Santos, lead advocate at ICT (internet and communications technology) coalition Better Internet Philippines. “The Bifrost cable system is one of several trans-Pacific submarine cable systems landing in the Philippines. This will bring more competition for Pacific transit for Tier 1 internet service providers, content, and BPOs,” Mirandilla-Santos said. She added that because Bifrost’s route avoids the West Philippine Sea, it provides “a more diverse and resilient choice of cable routes to Asia.” Tier 1 Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are the international top-level networks that form the backbone of the global internet. They own vast international infrastructure — including subsea cables — and can exchange traffic with each other without paying transit fees, a relationship called “settlement-free peering.” Tier 2 firms, which include country-wide providers such as Globe and PLDT in the Philippines, typically buy transit from Tier 1s but also peer with others regionally. Tier 3 providers are the last-mile ISPs, such as those found in the provinces, that purchase bandwidth from Tier 1s or 2s to serve end-users. By adding another route for Tier 1 networks and Philippine ISPs to interconnect, Bifrost strengthens the country’s foothold in the global internet map — and, as Mirandilla-Santos stressed, helps make internet access stronger, more secure, and more affordable. Bifrost will especially have an impact in Mindanao connectivity. Backed by Meta and Amazon, it’s the second international cable system to land in Mindanao. Mirandilla-Santos noted that this could spur “more investment in the region in terms of increasing Mindanao data traffic, interconnection facilities, more fiber, and hopefully more data centers.” The first international submarine cable to land in Mindanao was the SEA-US Cable, which became operational in August 2017, connecting the Philippines to Indonesia, Palau, Guam, and the US. The cable, owned by a consortium that includes Globe Telecom, has a landing station located in Barangay Talomo in Davao City. With Bifrost now the 14th international cable system landing in the country, Mirandilla-Santos expects the competition to reduce international transit costs. “We expect this to eventually translate to cheaper wholesale bandwidth for last-mile providers and, in effect, for end users,” she said. Mirandilla-Santos explained that having multiple international cables improves redundancy and reliability: if one route goes down, data can be rerouted through others. The launch of the cable ties in well with the recently enacted Konektadong Pinoy law, currently in the process of drafting its implementing rules and regulations (IRR) which aims to open every segment of the data transmission network — from international cables to the last mile — to more players. “Due to Konektadong Pinoy’s reforms, we also expect the entry of foreign investors for interconnection and data centers. This will make Philippine internet more robust and resilient, as we will no longer be relying on just a few players providing data transmission networks and services. Foreign players do not only bring in technological advancements and competition, they also often bring with them global best practices in terms of quality of service, cybersecurity standards, and customer service,” Mirandilla-Santos said. Addressing concerns about the Philippines’ growing reliance — as noted by a lawmaker during a DICT budget hearing — on Meta-backed infrastructure, she said that the fear may be overblown, noting how Meta is just one of many companies delivering connectivity. “As international submarine cables are large-scale infrastructure projects that require huge capital (up to billions of dollars), a company like Meta is often just part of a consortium made up of other investors, such as telecommunications companies, other tech firms, and regional service providers. Being one of the investors does not equate to control of those cable systems,” Mirandilla-Santos explained. – Rappler.com",True,true,What do subsea cables such as the new Bifrost bring to PH connectivity?,https://www.rappler.com/technology/what-subsea-cables-bifrost-bring-philippines-connectivity/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines— Wake Up with Jim and Saab podcaster Saab Magalona-Bacarro was a 32-year-old mother of two young sons when she was first diagnosed with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). “It’s like having a lot of tabs open in your web browser, and you just can’t pick one. It’s like, ‘oh, wait, wait, which one, which one?’ And then all of the tasks that you have are absolutely the same importance,” the mental health advocate explained at the Rappler Social Good Summit 2025 on Sunday, November 16. Prior to learning she had ADHD, she found herself frustrated with a lot of her behaviors, like not being able to finish tasks, forgetting things, and cutting people off mid-sentence. “I was really mean to myself, pre-diagnosis. I would think, ‘oh, you’re just so annoying’,” she shared. In December 2020, she received a formal diagnosis that finally gave her the clarity she needed. Her laziness or personality wasn’t a problem, the way she originally thought — it was just how her brain functioned. At the time, she was drowning in overwhelm and self-doubt, but was ultimately motivated to find help for her children’s sake. They needed her, and so she sought support for her ADHD. She tried group coaching based in the United States, which gave her a new sense of self-understanding through listening to the stories of other people with ADHD. Accepting her diagnosis grew easier. Finding that community reassured her that she wasn’t “going crazy” and that she wasn’t alone in her struggles. “You start thinking, ‘oh, okay, then that’s how your brain works,’ and we move forward,” she said. Now, she strongly advocates for the ADHD community. She also founded the Chaos Control Club, offering Filipinos the same services that helped her navigate her mental condition, including group-coaching calls, private podcast feeds, and community hubs. “The best part is the community where we just talk about what we’re going through,” she said. Apart from ADHD, Magalona-Bacarro also advocates for cerebral palsy because of her son Pancho. She shared that although in the past, people would hide their disabled children at home out of shame or protection, she personally loves to show off all the things her child is capable of. Even when other children see her son in public and ask questions about his physical appearance, she doesn’t take it negatively. “I like it that there are opportunities to educate, especially for well-meaning kids and people who are actually curious to learn more,” she said. Rather than treating mental and physical disabilities as something that shouldn’t be talked about, she encourages people to continue researching and learning about them. She had noticed a growing openness about mental health, especially since the pandemic, but she also acknowledges that there still remains a stigma for ADHD and mental disabilities. Many still believe that people with these conditions are simply being overly dramatic. With this, she calls the public to be more open-minded and less judgmental towards these individuals. Apart from the stigma, she also recognizes that there is still a lot more to be done in terms of access to support and healthcare. “I feel like it has been said that ADHD is just something that only the privileged have. Like, the poor don’t have ADHD. Because [they] can’t afford a diagnosis or treatment,” she said. She emphasized that the government should provide better accessibility to therapy and psychiatrists, so that more people can get a professional diagnosis and seek treatment. For her, it’s never too late to get help. Ultimately, with the proper support and community, Magalona-Bacarro believes people with ADHD or other mental or physical disabilities can find a way to move forward despite their condition. –Alyana Fabella/Rappler.com Alyana Fabella is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the Ateneo de Manila University.",True,true,‘That’s just how my brain works’: Saab Magalona-Bacarro shares ADHD journey,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/saab-magalona-bacarro-adhd-journey-social-good-summit-2025/,Rappler

Mostly for my mother and me, although it took my two other siblings many years to stop being sad during the holidays. We all felt like our whole pitied us. They pitied my mother who could not hold a man despite being legally married to her. They pitied us for growing up without a father to protect us. It was awful. I hated their looks of pity then. I still find people’s stares and silent messages to each other very triggering. My mother died two years ago and never got over my father leaving her. My two other siblings used to be as sad as me, but have gotten over it. They are now both married and have families of their own. So it is only me now. MY mother and I used to live together. Now I feel so alone. Each sibling invites me to their own Christmas parties, one on Christmas Eve, the other on Christmas Day. When New Years is about to come, it is the same thing. I tried going once, many years ago, but it was too painful. I thought seeing my first niece that first (and only) Christmas I went would make things easier. It did not. I felt foolish thinking sadness could lift that simply, that quickly. When I hear Christmas carols in the shopping malls, restaurants, coffee shops, I feel like running away. In fact, I actually rushed out of a mall once, it was that painful. If my siblings can get over it, why can’t I? Please help, John Dear John, It almost seems as though your world stopped 37 years ago and you have since become resigned to a half life. Just as your mother never moved on, nor have you. You are still overwhelmed by your father’s defection and its association with Christmas tarnishes any of the joy that others experience at this time of the year. Yet your siblings have followed a different path and are seemingly flourishing (at least by comparison), despite sharing the same upbringing. Does this perhaps owe something to living apart from your mother and/or having the support of a spouse and children? You ask how to move on. Therapy would definitely help you address both your aversion to Christmas and the family dysfunction that still weighs so heavily upon you. In addition, there is a suspicion that you may be suffering from depression which should also be investigated. The internet is a source of help for combating both Christmas blues and depression. You can review numerous studies which offer support in these situations. The literature on depression is even more extensive. Studies also show that combinations of exercise, diet, socialization, etc. can be very beneficial not only for dealing with depression but for overall health and increasing longevity. Finally, since your siblings have managed to move on, it would perhaps also help not only to spend time with them but also to experiment and try the coping techniques that have worked for them. One or more of the above may hopefully prove of use. All the best, JAFBaer Dear John: Thank you very much for your letter. Mr. Baer suggested therapy as a possible way to deal with what is obviously a depression and I agree with him 100% that therapy would be immensely helpful for you. It is possible your therapy might take some time, given that your depression seems to have started when your father left your mother 37 years ago. However, it may also take merely one or two CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy sessions) to alleviate the same depression, especially if it is based on faulty beliefs that CBT is known to examine and help demolish. Let me give you an example of why it may take a much shorter time than you and most people would anticipate. While your depression seems to be more continuous and more complex than a mere “anniversary depression” it is possible that this anniversary that triggered your mother’s and your major depressions might be relieved by understanding what this is all about. You have already figured out the original trauma that caused the family depression you all experienced – your father’s leaving your mother during the holiday season. In that sense, the cues that would ordinarily bring joy to other people — Christmas decorations and carols throughout almost any place you go to, for example — are trauma-related cues for you and could even be amplified because they are expected and thus bring anxiety, even dread, way before the fact. When one is depressed, one tends to judge oneself more harshly and the fact that your depression has lasted so long, especially compared to your siblings who seem to have overcome theirs, can make yours even worse, triggering questions like: “What the hell is wrong with me?!!?” or “What is so wrong with me that Ate and Kuya have gotten over theirs and I have still not been able to?” The above feeling of possible shame or anger about your now being the only one who has not been “cured” of your depression brings us to another point. OO ng apala! (My goodness, come to think of it, you’re absolutely right!) Why are you the only one who has not overcome this? This is a good time to remember that trauma is not the objective fact of what actually happened (Your father leaving your mother, your family now being “broken”); trauma is what happens to you. In that sense, trauma is subjective, filtered through your personal circumstances like age when it happened (and thus how impressionable you were), temperament, gender, etc. Were you your mother’s favorite so you unconsciously may have felt that to truly support your mother, you had to take on her actual and never ending pain? The fact that you lived with her all these years might have exacerbated this need to support her as best you could. Forgive me, dearest John. You may suddenly feel you have been barraged by all these reasons for your depression. And none of them might make any sense!! But then again, they might and this is one reason therapy could help you immensely. At the risk of sounding mayabang (inordinately proud) I feel that, instead of merely being overwhelmed by the holidays, you wrote to us. Putting pen to paper and trying to make sense of all that has been happening all these years could be the first meaningful step to confronting your problems. Indeed, I hope that this alone is encouragement for “happy holidays,” or perhaps, more realistically, “Not-as-sad-a Christmas as it has been for the past 37 years.” Mabuhay ka, dearest John, and if you can, maybe give your siblings a chance to help lighten your spirit this year?

"MILAN, Italy – Italian fashion house Giorgio Armani unveiled on Sunday, September 28, the last collection personally worked on by its late designer and founder, at Brera art museum in the heart of Milan. Armani, known in the fashion world as “King Giorgio,” passed away earlier this month at the age of 91. The show, conceived to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the fashion house, turned into a tribute to the late designer. The event drew a host of celebrities including actors Richard Gere and Cate Blanchett and was held in the cloister of the Brera art museum, adorned with lanterns for the occasion. Models walked under the porticoes in fluid, lightweight outfits, accompanied by live piano music performed by Italian composer Ludovico Einaudi. The collection, featuring a color palette that ranged from grey to deep blue to dark green, was titled “Pantelleria, Milan,” referencing two places dear to the designer. “This collection, the last Giorgio Armani worked on personally, is in some ways a testament to style and the close of a cycle, so that new ones may begin,” the brand said in the press notes. The show concluded with a solo walk by Agnese Zogla, one of the designer’s favourite models, who wore an elegant blue gown. At the end of the catwalk, Armani’s niece Silvana and the designer’s life and business partner Leo Dell’Orco – respectively head of design for the women’s and men’s collections – came out to greet the audience and were met with lengthy applause. “I’m… humbled that we were invited to come back to Milano to celebrate his excellency,” said director Spike Lee upon entering the show. “Apart from being an incredible designer, he was a humanitarian. He was an incredible philanthropist,” said Blanchett. Giorgio Armani’s catwalk show closed Milan Fashion Week, with fashionistas now heading to Paris for the next round of shows. – Rappler.com",True,true,Giorgio Armani unveils late designer’s last collection,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/style/giorgio-armani-unveils-late-designer-last-collection/,Rappler
"LONDON, United Kingdom – Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay goes behind the camera for a new series, Knife Edge: Chasing Michelin Stars, that shines the spotlight on restaurants working to attain the coveted culinary accolade. The multi-starred restaurateur and TV personality is an executive producer of the eight-part Apple TV+ series premiering on Friday, which visits eateries in the United States, Britain, Italy, Nordics and Mexico seeking to gain, or retain, stars. “(It) is a sort of a real reflection on what goes on in these businesses: what’s at stake, what kind of jeopardy is up for grabs and then the emotions,” Ramsay told Reuters. “This is (an)…unscripted, real version of life in the culinary world and the extent you go to for the badge of honor … Actors want Oscars, football players want F.A. Cup winners’ medals, chefs want Michelin stars.” Episodes show host Jesse Burgess meeting chefs as they compose menus, prepare dishes, and seek to impress that lone diner who may be a secret Michelin inspector. There is also input from the anonymous Michelin inspectors, voiced by actors. “We ask them questions and they answer. In reality, it was all … very secretive so that none of the producers or nobody actually saw the real-life inspectors,” Burgess said. “They just judge the food on the plate.” The first Michelin guide was published by the French tyre company in 1900, with the restaurant star rating introduced in the 1920s. The annual guides award up to three stars. Ramsay received his first Michelin star when he was head chef at London restaurant Aubergine. His own Restaurant Gordon Ramsay has held three stars since 2001. “You become an overnight sensation and then you’ve got the fight and the slug to maintain it … you need to understand the word delegation, teaching, creating, and most importantly, passing the baton on,” he said. “I have one foot in the kitchen and one foot in the media world and am I there 16 hours a day? No, of course I’m not. I am there like a conductor and I’ll sign things off, but I want to hear from them … And so maintaining it is where the real work starts.” Asked if he still gets nervous when Michelin issues new editions of the guide, Ramsay said: “I do get nervous … no one likes losing … (going) down to even two stars is unique, but … it’s major headlines if you do. I’m often asked, ‘What would you do if you did lose a star?’ Then, I’d fight and win it back.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Gordon Ramsay’s ‘Knife Edge’ spotlights culinary world’s chase for Michelin glory,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/gordon-ramsay-knife-edge-culinary-world-chase-michelin-glory/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — The works of late multi-awarded artist Juvenal Sansó don’t end at the canvas or in museums — Sansó’s art extends into everyday spaces with CASA JUAN, a homeware brand focused on showcasing Filipino design. This limited-edition collaboration brings Sansó’s artwork onto functional home items, making his art more accessible and part of daily life. It also continues CASA JUAN’s ongoing effort to highlight local artists through their collections since 2020. In 2024, contemporary painter Dominic Rubio’s works were featured. Owned by Michelle Fontelera, CASA JUAN is a homeware brand driven by one mission: to bring a touch of the Philippines to every home with handmade plate sets, tabletop accessories, and others. Juvenal Sansó was born in Spain, but spent most of his life in the Philippines, which greatly shaped his 70-year artistic journey. Throughout the years, he explored different art styles, from darker themes post-World War II to more vibrant colors by mid-20th century. His colorful journey through paintings, prints, photography, textiles, and even costume design is what CASA JUAN wants to embody and keep relevant for a younger generation. The collaboration is particularly special for Fontelera, not only because it is the brand’s biggest collection, but also because it means a lot to her personally. “I always dreamt of having a Sansó. I guess with this collaboration and this collection, my items are the closest to a Sansó I can get,” she shared with Rappler. Out of the artist’s works, Fontelera intentionally chose bright pieces that spark joy. These include paintings from the En Vas Series, which were said to had been made during the happiest times of Sansó’s life. CASA JUAN’s plate and coaster set features the artist’s vibrant bouquet paintings, which are a classic part of his work. Fontelera also curated A Cerulean Daydream, Endearing Charm, and Of Gentle Reminiscences as works displayed in the collection’s trays, jewelry boxes, and trinket dishes. These paintings highlight idyllic landscapes. Though Sansó’s art can be hard to acquire, even for collectors like Fontelera, the CASA JUAN collection has made it possible for his works to be part of everyday life. “We really want [people] to use them for the dining table, and not just on the shelf or frame,” she explained. However, the exclusivity remains given the limited nature of the collection. Fontelera said that based on experiences with past collections, the Sansó collection is expected to sell out within a month or two. The limited-edition collection is available on CASA JUAN’s online store. This collection is one of the many initiatives Fundación Sansó has taken in supporting local art, as it is known for investing in young talent and collaborating with local brands. While CASA JUAN is still keeping its future collaborations with local artists and fashion designers under wraps, it continues with its mission to create homeware that blends art with practicality. — Alyana Fabella/Rappler.com Alyana Fabella is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the Ateneo de Manila University.",True,true,"Sansó’s ‘happiest’ works, reimagined into Filipino homeware",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/juvenal-sanso-happiest-works-reimagined-casa-juan-homeware/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – A silhouette of a woman in a modern Filipiniana pantsuit sits in the dark hallways of the theater. As the screen flickered to life, Sydney Loyola shared her story to Filipinos for the first time. Sydney, a Fil-Am transwoman and renowned Philippine dance master and choreographer, is the protagonist of the documentary film, The Road to Sydney. It was screened for the first time in the country in November at the QCinema International Film Festival. The feature documentary, directed by Emmy-awarded producer Benito Bautista and produced by Emma Francisco of Wanderlustproject Films and Sonia Delen, Wendy Pascual, and Conrad Calalang of OneUp Film Studios, navigates Sydney’s deeply personal journey on her challenges after her gender affirmation. “I’ve seen the film three times already, and all the times I did feel like reliving everything. The trauma becomes fresh again, and then I see the triumph,” Sydney shared at the talkback program after a screening. As she steps into her life as a woman, Sydney begins walking her path to healing — reconnecting with her roots, reclaiming her art, and rebuilding her relationship with her estranged father. Before there was Sydney, there was Jay Loyola, born and raised in Puerto Princesa in Palawan. Sydney shared in her stories that Jay was a shy and emotionally sensitive kid, and that at the early age of five, he already knew he was different. “My mom used to tell me that her pregnancy craving with me was a jackfruit, and so I’m similar to its tree that bleeds sap when cut — I cry when I’m hurt,” Sydney said. Jay started attending formal dance classes at this age, and in a way, it was an outlet for him to express his emotions. Long before he knew his true identity, movement was already a part of his core. He started with ballet before he discovered the Bayanihan technique or Philippine dance. Until one day, he heard of a newly opened dance school managed by an Austrian named Hans-Christian Wagner. Young Jay learned about modern/contemporary dance from him. “What’s good about dance is it has become my anchor. Because in dance, when I’m in the studio, I’m not judged as a person but according to what I can contribute,” she said. In dance, Sydney believes and feels there is no gender. “Whenever I have doubts, I go back to dancing,” she added. And dance never failed to support Jay’s dream of becoming Sydney. It paved the way for him to perform abroad and to further hone his techniques. He then became the artistic director of Holy Trinity University in Palawan. But the main motivation to move to the United States wasn’t dance. It was his friend Laika who suffered from sickness that made Jay realize he needed a retirement plan. “Laika used to be a very feminine and beautiful hairdresser in our town, but when I visited her at the hospital, she became frail and her facial hair grew,” she narrated. “At that moment, I realized that I wanted a better retirement plan, and staying in Palawan might make it impossible for me to reach that dream.” And so Jay took a leap in 2006, and once again, dance paved the path for Sydney. After a decade of working in the US, Jay finally decides to go through a complete transition for gender affirmation. This was also the start of the eight-year process of filming The Road to Sydney. “In the film, we showed Sydney’s life as Jay and the events leading to the full realization of Sydney herself. It all started in Palawan, and it was just fitting to end the story where it began,” said film director Benito Bautista. Sydney’s physical transition took about four years. Throughout the process, she shared that there were multiple times she still questioned Sydney’s identity. “I didn’t really know who the final Sydney would be. I didn’t have an image in mind, or a face I wanted to copy, but one morning in the fourth year of my transition, I woke up feeling that the wait was over,” Sydney said. Once she felt her soul matched her body and appearance, she knew she was already completely “Sydney” and it was the perfect time to go home. One of the things she envisioned doing in Palawan was to choreograph and perform a dance by the beach. They had the opportunity to dedicate it to her deceased mother, and Sydney shared that this was her favorite scene in the film, as it felt like a full-circle moment. “I used to dance on the beaches with my cousins when we were younger, and now, I can finally do it as a woman,” she shared. “I was in hiding when I was still Jay, but when I performed as Sydney, it felt like the real me. And even better, my audience will see me as Sydney and not as Jay anymore.” Another thing she wanted to do was to visit her estranged father and hopefully find acceptance. The documentary team initially faced some challenges, but in the end, the cameras captured a fond father-daughter moment that made the whole cinema cry. “I realized everybody is probably affected by my interaction and relationship with my dad, even if they’re not part of the LGBTQIA+ community,” said Sydney. To her, returning to the Philippines was more than just a film screening. The documentary is her personal life she accepted to share — both as Jay and Sydney. “After I’ve shared my story, it stops being about me,” she said. “It starts to become about everyone else who struggles to find their true identity and those who are still in hiding, and I’m hoping my story gives them the courage they need.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Philippine dance master returns home with ‘The Road to Sydney’,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/philippine-dance-master-returns-home-road-sydney-loyola/,Rappler
"NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – The millgate price of locally produced sugar dropped to an average of P2,200 per 50-kilogram bag on Thursday, October 9, sending shockwaves among sugar industry players in the Negros Island Region (NIR). The current price, nearly P300 below the P2,500 standard cost of production, has angered sugar planters who demanded an immediate explanation from the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) on why it happened barely a month after the start of the milling season. SRA Administrator Pablo Luis Azcona has yet to issue a statement as of Friday, October 10. Linley Retirado, president of the Lucio Tan-led Victorias Milling Company (VMC), Asia’s biggest sugar refinery, told Rappler that their bidding price as of Thursday stood at P2,260 per LKG. The Jose Mari Chan-owned Binalbagan-Isabela Sugar Company Incorporated (BISCOM) offered the same rate. Sagay City’s Lopez Sugar Central posted a bidding price of P2,257 per LKG, while Universal Robina Corporation’s (URC) sugar mills in Kabankalan and La Carlota offered P2,270 and P2,251.72 per LKG, respectively, according to Ang Mangunguma, a group of agrarian reform beneficiaries turned sugar planters in Negros Occidental. Calling the drop “unacceptable,” Negros Occidental 5th District Representative Emilio Bernardino Yulo III said he will bring the issue to Congress next week. “This is unacceptable. We need an explanation from SRA on why this happened,” Yulo, a former SRA board member, told Rappler on Friday, October 10. He said it was the SRA’s mandate to maintain a balance between sugar producers and consumers, adding that allowing prices to fall below the cost of production “is a no-no.” Himamaylan City Vice Mayor Justin Silos Gatuslao, also a sugar planter, lamented the situation, saying he pitied small producers struggling with fertilizer prices averaging P1,800 to P2,000 per bag. He said he will push for a resolution next week at the city council of Himamaylan asking the national government to intervene, calling the matter “concerning” and “urgent.” Wennie Sancho, secretary-general of the General Alliance of Workers Association (GAWA), blamed the crisis on sugar importation. “This is already a recurring problem in the industry with sugar importation as always the culprit,” Sancho said. He argued that local prices would not fall below production cost “if there are no imported supplies flooding the local markets right now.” “It’s obvious. Again, somebody is playing the sugar industry to the expense of ordinary laborers,” Sancho said. On Tuesday, October 7, the National Federation of Sugar Planters (NFSP) warned that importation under Sugar Order No. 8, series of 2024–2025, could depress prices. NFSP president Enrique Rojas said excessive importation would hurt the industry early in the milling season. “In fact, last week, we already communicated with the SRA as to our concerns regarding the excessive sugar importation. We agreed to an initial importation of 150,000 metric tons, but more than such volume have already entered the country as of September 14,” Rojas said. “Additional importation, therefore, is ‘suicidal’ to the sugar industry.” Sancho warned that the price slump could trigger job cuts in Negros haciendas, dimming hopes for a “merry Christmas” among sugar workers and their families as planters reduce labor costs. The NIR has around 150,000 hacienda laborers, excluding hundreds of thousands of agrarian reform beneficiaries who have become small sugar planters, Sancho said. – Rappler.com",True,true,Negros sugar planters alarmed as millgate prices plunge below production cost,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/visayas/negros-occidental-sugar-planters-alarmed-millgate-prices-plunge-october-10-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – E-wallet use among sari-sari (general merchandise) stores surged by 75% this year, signaling a digital shift among neighborhood retailers, according to a new report by Filipino tech startup Packworks. Based on transaction data and a survey of over 2,000 store owners within its 300,000-strong network, half reported a 75% increase in e-wallet usage between January and August 2025. Another 20% saw usage double, 20% of those surveyed noted a 50% rise, and 10% reported a 10% uptick. Packworks is a business-to-business firm for micro-retailers with services for helping stores with business inventory and bookkeeping, among others. Store owners attributed the growth to stronger consumer demand for cashless transactions. Around 40% of stores use e-wallets for in-store payments, 30% for bill payments, and 30% for cash-in and cash-out transactions. GCash dominates usage with 85%, followed by Maya at 15%. To handle demand, some stores maintain up to five e-wallet accounts with a combined capacity of up to P3.5 million per month. About 30% plan to upgrade to business accounts for higher transaction limits. This digital shift is quickly becoming a critical source of revenue. Around 13% of store owners say their e-wallet earnings equal their revenue from physical goods. “Bukod sa kita namin sa tindahan, nagkaroon kami ng dagdag kita sa paggamit sa mga e-wallet kasi meron kaming tubo na P10 hanggang P20 sa pag-cash-in at cash-out, o di kaya tuwing nagbabayad ng kuryente, tubig, o internet ang mga customer,” said Rachel Miguel, a store owner from Bacolod. (Besides the income we earn from the store, we also get extra earnings from using e-wallets because we earn a profit of P10 to P20 from cash-in and cash-out transactions, or whenever customers pay for electricity, water, or internet bills.) Among the rest of the respondents, e-wallets still contribute significantly: 66% say that around 20% of their revenues come from e-wallet use, and the remaining 21% say their e-wallet earnings account for 10% of their total revenue. GCash and Maya are the widely used e-wallets, with 85% of store owners reporting using GCash for their business transactions and 15% using Maya. Packworks chief platform officer Hubert Yap said the trend shows sari-sari stores evolving into digital and financial hubs. “Aside from simply selling ‘tingi‘ (small quantity) physical items , they are now diversifying their product range, offering high-margin, value-added financial services and integrating digital tools such as our app to fundamentally improve their operations and function as near-frictionless nano-banks for the neighborhoods they serve,” he said. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas reported that 57% of total retail transactions were cashless in 2024, underscoring the rise of digital payments nationwide. – Rappler.com",True,true,E-wallet use jumps 75% in sari-sari stores – survey,https://www.rappler.com/technology/e-wallet-use-jumps-sari-sari-stores-survey-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – A global shortage of memory chips, propelled by surging demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, is expected to push up the average selling prices of personal computers and smartphones in 2026, said research firm IDC. The memory market — which includes DRAM and NAND flash used in everyday devices — is facing an imbalance as production capacity shifts toward AI-oriented components. DRAM is fast-access memory that computers use to run programs and applications. NAND flash is storage memory for saving photos, documents, and all other files. The production for both types is expected to be affected by the growing demand of AI data centers. The IDC explained: “Instead of expanding conventional DRAM and NAND used in smartphones, PCs, and other consumer electronics, major memory makers have shifted production toward memory used in AI data centers, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and high-capacity DDR5. This has restricted the supply of general-purpose memory modules and driven up prices across the board.” Memory manufacturing capacity is being reallocated. Instead of allocating supply of conventional memory used in consumer devices, manufacturers like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron — the world’s three biggest memory makers — have shifted production toward memory modules that serve AI servers and hyperscaler data center infrastructure. “This is a zero-sum game: every wafer allocated to an HBM stack for an Nvidia GPU is a wafer denied to the LPDDR5X (DRAM) module of a mid-range smartphone or the SSD (NAND) of a consumer laptop,” the IDC said. This shift has tightened the availability of DRAM and NAND for smartphones and PCs, driving up component prices. For smartphones, memory often constitutes a significant portion of the bill of materials, especially in mid-range devices. As memory costs rise, smartphone makers may have little choice but to increase prices, cut memory specifications, or both. The IDC’s downside scenarios suggest average smartphone selling prices could rise 3-5% in a moderate case or up to 6-8% in a “pessimistic scenario.” In the PC market, the memory shortage converges with the transition to AI-enhanced PC systems and the end of legacy software support cycles, specifically Windows 10. Major vendors have signaled broad price increases, and under the IDC’s scenarios, average selling prices for PCs could also climb 4–8% in 2026. “The severity and duration of the shortage will be determined by how quickly production capacity can expand and how effectively demand rebalances across segments,” the IDC said. – Rappler.com",True,true,"PC, smartphone prices to rise by up to 8% as AI drives memory shortage — research firm",https://www.rappler.com/technology/pc-smartphone-rising-prices-ai-memory-shortage/,Rappler
"Imagine a ₱10-billion flood control program spread across Bulacan, Pampanga, and Cavite. Under the current, opaque system, this is how Filipino taxpayers’ money is used to fund “ghost projects” and line project proponents’ pockets: Each regional office of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) submits project proposals and progress reports manually. Disbursements would then pass through layers of accounting officers, contractors, and suppliers. These ghost projects — such as dredging that never happened and the construction of weak embankments that would collapse after heavy rainfall — will thereafter be certified “completed.” Auditors face missing receipts, altered logs, and falsified progress reports. Kickbacks are laundered through shell contractors or fake subcontracting chains. Witnesses later allege that as much as 25% of the project cost is siphoned through cash withdrawals and split among lawmakers, district engineers, and private partners. Each monsoon season, when the floodwaters rise across Bulacan, Pampanga, or Cavite, the tragedy is more than meteorological — it’s man-made. Behind every clogged estero, every collapsed embankment, and every vanished floodway lies a paper trail of padded contracts, fake progress reports, and project funds drained long before the first cement truck arrived. Flood control, one of the most capital-intensive programs of the DPWH, has also been one of its most corrupted. Billions of pesos in government funds have been lost to “ghost” dredging, overpriced embankments, and nonexistent canals. What makes this type of corruption especially resilient is its invisibility. Unlike road projects or buildings, flood-control works often lie beneath the surface. Once completed, they’re buried under soil or hidden beneath water — making inspection difficult, if not impossible, for ordinary citizens. Even worse, the paper-based procurement-and-auditing system — reliant on affidavits, signatures, and manual vouchers — offers too many opportunities for collusion. Certificates of completion can be fabricated, receipts misplaced, and project milestones manipulated to justify premature fund releases. By the time the Commission on Audit (COA) reviews the documents, the money is gone — along with the evidence. The result is a pattern all too familiar in Philippine governance: year after year, the country is inundated with floodwater and corruption. But what if there existed a technology capable of making this cycle of deceit impossible? A system that renders every peso, every transaction, every contractor traceable — permanently? A blockchain represents trust without middlemen. In essence, it is a digital ledger distributed across multiple computers or “nodes.” Every transaction recorded in it is time-stamped, encrypted, and immutable — meaning once entered, it cannot be changed or deleted without the consensus of all participants. In the private sector, blockchain has revolutionized supply chains, finance, and data verification. In the public sector, it offers an equally transformative potential: eliminating discretionary opacity that nurtures corruption. Envision applying blockchain to public works — particularly flood-control projects, long seen as a “cash cow” of district politics. Instead of project data being stored in a single, editable database inside a DPWH office, every record — from bidding documents to disbursement vouchers — would exist simultaneously across COA, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), DPWH, and civil-society oversight nodes. To falsify a record, one would have to alter every copy of that record in every node — an impossible feat without immediate detection. This creates, for the first time, trust by code, not by promise. Under the current practice, each DPWH regional office prepares flood-control project proposals and submits physical or emailed copies to the central office. Bidding processes rely on documents that can be revised, backdated, or swapped. Once a contract is awarded, progress reports become the basis for fund releases. In theory, oversight mechanisms exist. In practice, however, collusion thrives. Fake progress reports trigger premature disbursements: This bureaucratic fog allows unscrupulous officials to justify ghost projects and hide kickbacks. Contractors who play along are rewarded with new contracts; those who resist are blacklisted. Transparency is neither technical nor procedural — it is optional, exercised only when politically convenient. Now, let us visualize a reengineered system — the Philippine Flood Control Ledger, powered by blockchain. Every project begins its life digitally. The DPWH, DBM, and COA each maintains a blockchain node. Data — including cost estimates, contractor identity, geotagged location, and timeline — is encoded once, permanently. As work progresses, each milestone is verified through independent data sources: drone imagery; satellite photos, or an IoT (Internet of Things) sensor which is a hardware device with a sensor and communication capabilities that collects data from the physical world, such as dredging volume, to be transmitted over a network to a cloud platform for analysis and action. Each collected proof is hashed (or mathematically encoded) and attached to the blockchain entry. Once verified, the smart contract — a self-executing digital agreement — automatically releases the corresponding tranche of funds. No certificate. No signature. No “fixers.” Every peso moves only when physics — not politics — says the work is done. Consider a hypothetical ₱200-million project in Bulacan assigned to a contractor, Vantage Point Construction (Vantage). The project is divided into four stages of ₱50 million each. After two months, Vantage uploads progress data claiming 60% completion. However, the blockchain ledger cross-references satellite images showing only 35% of the embankment completed. Immediately, the smart contract halts the release of the third tranche, alerts all participating nodes — COA, DPWH, DBM — and triggers a compliance check. The discrepancy can neither be hidden nor erased. For the first time, the law is not just enforced — it is embedded in a code. No technology is corruption-proof by default. To make blockchain truly impervious to manipulation, it must operate within a secure, transparent ecosystem. Here’s how I view it: Multi-Agency GovernanceEach node — COA, DBM, DPWH, Ombudsman, and accredited non-governmental organizations (NGOs) — holds equal authority. No single agency can alter or delete data without triggering a network-wide alert. Open-Source ProtocolsThe software code must be publicly available for inspection by independent information technology (IT) experts. Open-source verification prevents “black box” tampering or backdoor manipulation. Public Access DashboardTo ensure public scrutiny, citizens, journalists, and watchdogs can view non-sensitive data, such as project status, cost, and contractor. Encrypted IdentitiesWhile data is transparent, personal identities (e.g., auditors, whistleblowers) are cryptographically protected to prevent harassment or retaliation. Independent Forensic AuditsThird-party blockchain auditors perform semi-annual reviews to confirm integrity and detect anomalies. Offline Redundancy and Cyber DefenseMultiple offline backups stored in secure, geographically distributed locations protect against hacking or data corruption. These six layers transform blockchain from a mere digital tool into a constitutional firewall against corruption. Some experts cast doubt on how blockchain can detect malicious data inputs. Admittedly, blockchain cannot self-correct lies once they’re recorded — but it can (1) prevent many false entries through consensus and smart-contract checks; (2) expose their provenance transparently; and (3) attach verifiable corrections without erasing history. This makes blockchain not a “truth machine,” but a “transparency engine.” It ensures every actor is accountable for what they input — and that any attempt to mislead is permanently traceable. Imagine a DPWH regional office managing a ₱80-million flood-control dike project in Bulacan. Under traditional systems, a project engineer could falsify a “100% completed” report and attach a fake COA compliance certificate to trigger final payment — often without physical verification. Once the data enters the accounting system, it becomes part of the government record, enabling kickbacks or ghost projects. With blockchain, here’s how each stage could change — and how falsification could be caught and corrected. 1. Smart Contract Project Setup A smart contract governs the project milestones: Each disbursement is automatically triggered only when specific digitally signed proofs are uploaded. Safeguard: All stakeholders — DPWH, COA, local government unit (LGU), and an independent technical audit team — must sign digitally. The blockchain won’t recognize unsigned or incomplete milestone submissions. 2. False Completion Attempt Let’s say the regional engineer, in collusion with a contractor, uploads: They use valid credentials, so the system initially accepts the submission. At first glance, this looks legitimate — the blockchain now stores a permanent but false entry showing completion. 3. Multi-Oracle Verification Layer Activates However, blockchain is linked to multiple oracles: Mechanism in Action: The data isn’t deleted (it immutability stays), but a corrective transaction is appended, automatically labeling the entry as “disputed” pending review. 4. DAO-based Governance Rectification The case escalates to a Project Governance DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), composed of: DPWH Central Office representative, COA resident auditor, LGU engineer, citizen observer (civil society). They vote on a rectification proposal. If the DAO reaches majority consensus that the data is fraudulent, the smart contract rolls back the ₱20M pending final payment, freezing further releases. A rectification block is added with: Result: the public blockchain now shows both the false entry and the correction trail, making the fraud attempt permanently visible. 5. Automatic Flagging for COA and Ombudsman Because all government audit systems are interoperable via APIs (application programming interfaces), the flagged record automatically alerts the COA fraud detection unit, and the Ombudsman’s fact-finding office. Investigators can instantly trace who uploaded the original entry (timestamp + wallet ID + digital signature). No deletion, no excuses — accountability is cryptographically sealed. 6. Community Transparency and Citizen Oversight Citizens can open the public dashboard (e.g., dpwhfloodchain.gov.ph) and see: This not only deters collusion but builds public trust. If multiple Bulacan projects are flagged under the same regional engineer, analysts and journalists can map patterns of corruption across contracts. Blockchain cannot erase bad data — but it can trap it in the open. Through: A single falsified upload becomes an unerasable piece of evidence — one that exposes who, when, and how the lie was committed. This is the heart of blockchain’s anti-corruption utility — it turns cover-ups into breadcrumbs. The implications extend far beyond drainage canals and dikes. A blockchain-based ledger could be scaled across all infrastructure programs: Each project becomes part of a national integrity grid — a digital paper trail that cannot be burned. Even the most sophisticated networks of collusion crumble when data cannot be falsified. Globally, blockchain has already begun reshaping public accountability. In Estonia, land registries and public records are blockchain-secured, eliminating property fraud. Georgia uses blockchain to secure land titles, making document forgery impossible. In Colombia, pilot projects apply blockchain to public contracts, preventing alterations after bidding. Chile’s National Energy Commission adopted blockchain to verify energy pricing data, building trust among consumers. The Philippines can follow suit — but with a deeper purpose: not just efficiency, but redemption of a system long marred by patronage. Predictably, resistance will come from those who profit from opacity. Some lawmakers and local executives may argue that blockchain is “too technical,” “too costly,” or “too foreign.” In truth, the cost of inaction dwarfs any software expense. If even 5% of annual DPWH infrastructure outlays (roughly ₱80 billion) vanish into the corruption blackhole, then blockchain’s potential savings easily justify its investment. Another challenge is institutional inertia. Bureaucrats unaccustomed to transparency may fear automation. To counter this, training and pilot programs must be done in gradual phases, starting with high-risk sectors like flood control, where the payoff in credibility is immediate. The legal framework also matters. Legislation must classify blockchain records as official audit evidence, admissible in court and binding upon agencies. Under the current setup, witnesses risk retaliation, and affidavits often vanish or get rewritten. Blockchain flips this logic: every statement, evidence photo, or timestamped log uploaded becomes indelible. Even if a corrupt official later tries to coerce retraction, the digital record remains. This doesn’t just empower whistleblowers — it redefines testimonial truth. In effect, blockchain becomes the ultimate state witness: incorruptible, tireless, and immune to pressure. COA’s annual reports, though valuable, are often autopsies. They diagnose fraud after the patient — the public fund — has already died. In a blockchain system, COA becomes proactive, not reactive. Every disbursement is visible in real time. Anomalies trigger alerts the moment data diverges from verified ground truth. This transforms auditing from an afterthought to a continuous, living process. The collapse of public trust in government projects is as dangerous as physical flooding. Each scandal erodes faith in taxation, governance, and reform. Citizens begin to assume every canal is a cash conduit and every bridge, a payoff. By embedding transparency into code, blockchain begins to rebuild that faith. When ordinary Filipinos can open a web portal and see — verifiably — that ₱30 million was spent on work that has been truly and sufficiently completed, cynicism yields to accountability. Trust ceases to be rhetorical. It becomes mathematical. A national rollout must begin with pilot programs. Flood control in Central Luzon — the epicenter of recurring graft — is the ideal testbed. See related articles below: Parallel pilots can follow in the Visayas for coastal rehabilitation and in Mindanao for irrigation projects. Lessons learned can refine the architecture before nationwide expansion. Public-private collaboration is essential. Local tech startups, civil society groups, and academe must co-own the design — ensuring it serves citizens, not politicians and their cohorts. Ultimately, blockchain governance is not about technology, but moral architecture: coding honesty into the infrastructure of decision-making. This is the dream: Filipinos will finally have a country where every peso leaves a visible trail to something real and beneficial for everyone; where no lawmaker can “insert” projects without public knowledge; where COA’s database is not retrospective but real-time; where journalists can verify project truth in seconds, not years. In such a system, corruption cannot adapt because the system itself is immune to forgetting. Floodwaters may still rise from heavy rainfall, but this time, greed would not be the root cause. – Rappler.com I would like to thank my daughter Michelle for patiently teaching me about how blockchain works.

"The United States and China on Tuesday, October 14, began charging additional port fees on ocean shipping firms that move everything from holiday toys to crude oil, making the high seas a key front in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. China said it had started to collect the special charges on US-owned, operated, built, or flagged vessels but clarified that Chinese-built ships would be exempted from the levies. In details published by state broadcaster CCTV, China spelled out specific provisions on exemptions, which also include empty ships entering Chinese shipyards for repair. The China-imposed extra port fees would be collected at the first port of entry on a single voyage or for the first five voyages within a year, following an annual billing cycle beginning on April 17. Early this year, US President Donald Trump’s administration announced plans to levy the fees on China-linked ships to loosen the country’s grip on the global maritime industry and bolster US shipbuilding. An investigation during former president Joe Biden’s administration concluded China uses unfair policies and practices to dominate the global maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors, clearing the way for those penalties. China hit back last week, saying it would impose its own port fees on US-linked vessels from the same day the US fees took effect. Analysts expect China-owned container carrier COSCO to be most affected, shouldering nearly half of that segment’s expected $3.2 billion cost from those fees in 2026. In a related move, Beijing also imposed sanctions on Tuesday against five US-linked subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean which it said had “assisted and supported” a US probe into Chinese trade practices. Hanwha said it is aware of the announcement and is closely monitoring the potential business impact, and that it will continue to provide services to its customers, “including through our investments in the US maritime industry and via Hanwha Philly Shipyard.” Hanwha Ocean’s shares sank nearly 6%. China also launched an investigation into how the US probe affected its shipping and shipbuilding industries. “This tit-for-tat symmetry locks both economies into a spiral of maritime taxation that risks distorting global freight flows,” Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers Incorporated said in a research note. A Shanghai-based consultant who advises global companies on trade with China said the new fees may not be very disruptive to the industry and any rising costs probably would be captured in higher prices. “What are we going to do? Stop shipping? Trade is already pretty disrupted with the US, but companies are finding a way,” the consultant said, asking to remain anonymous as he was not authorized to speak with the media. The US announced last Friday a carve-out for long-term charterers of China-operated vessels carrying US ethane and LPG, deferring the port fees for them through December 10. But ship-tracking company Vortexa identified 45 LPG-carrying VLGCs — 11% of the total fleet — that would still be subject to China’s port fee, its Americas analyst Samantha Hartke said. Clarksons Research said in a report that the new port fees could affect oil-tankers accounting for 15% of global capacity. Jefferies analyst Omar Nokta estimated that 13% of crude tankers and 11% of container ships in the global fleet would be affected. In a reprisal against China curbing exports of critical minerals, Trump on Friday threatened to slap additional 100% tariffs on goods from China and put new export controls on “any and all critical software” by November 1. Administration officials hours later warned that countries voting in favor of a plan by the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from ocean shipping this week could face sanctions, port bans, or punitive vessel charges. China has publicly supported the IMO plan. “The weaponisation of both trade and environmental policy signals that shipping has moved from being a neutral conduit of global commerce to a direct instrument of statecraft,” Xclusiv said. Shares in Shanghai-listed COSCO rose more than 2% in early trading on Tuesday. The company said its board had approved a plan to buy back up to 1.5 billion yuan ($210.3 million) worth of its shares within the next three months to maintain corporate value and safeguard shareholder interest. The shipping firm did not immediately respond to Reuters’ queries about the port fees. – Rappler.com ($1 = 7.1337 Chinese yuan)",True,true,"US, China roll out tit-for-tat port fees, threatening more turmoil at sea",https://www.rappler.com/business/usa-china-port-fees-october-14-2025/,Rappler
"Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer: Ian, my boyfriend of six months, is becoming cold. Before, he was every girl’s dream boyfriend, but now he is every girl’s nightmare. We met on a dating app seven months ago. On our first meeting, I already shared the story of my first relationship; how my boyfriend betrayed me after we had vowed to be exclusive. To my horror, I found out he was dating other women, not even mentioning that we were already supposed to be exclusive to one another. I only found out because my work colleague saw him with another woman at a bar. When I confronted him, he couldn’t deny it. He didn’t even say he was sorry! I never felt so betrayed before. Because of that, I told Ian I have a phobia about being lied to. It is not my fault. I think it is merely a reaction to what sort of man my first boyfriend was, how badly he treated me. He is the reason the minute Ian is out of my sight, I get nervous and try to find out exactly where he is. And if he is free, why is he not with me then? Ian understood all this; I made sure to put all my cards on the table on our first date. Because of that, he understood what I had been through and understood what things triggered me. He was also very patient with me and reassured me I was safe with him. He quickly answered all my texts and always let me know where he was. Whenever I needed to be reassured, he was ready to do what was needed. Sometimes I would get upset when I didn’t hear from him at the exact time he said he would call. Sometimes I may have shouted and accused him of being with other girls when there was really no cause for me to think that, and he still apologized. But he’s changed. Now he is not as warm and kind as he used to be. Sometimes, he shows his impatience. My crying doesn’t affect him as much as it used to. What can I do to bring the old Ian back? Please help. I am desperate. Ainee Dear Ainee, Your relationship with Ian is only six months old so it is still in its infancy. You have chosen to tell him about how your first boyfriend (let’s call him Jaime) cheated on you, and that as a result, you have a phobia about lying. He has learnt that you keep a close eye on him, constantly check on his whereabouts and tend to think the worst if you cannot track his movements. You have learned that he is willing to reassure you at every turn and to put up with your need to control the relationship minute by minute. This state of affairs led you to believe that he was the ideal boyfriend. However, you now notice that he has recently become colder towards you, is inclined to impatience and less moved by your tears. As a result you would like to encourage the reappearance of the “old” Ian. Perhaps it is a good time to assess the viability of how you approach this relationship. While it is understandable that you were badly affected by your previous boyfriend’s infidelity and subsequent lack of remorse, you seem to have been treating Ian as though he were a second Jaime from the outset, despite a total lack of evidence as you yourself admit. You have been relentlessly policing his every move and it is not unreasonable to think that maybe he has begun to tire of this. He probably thought that with reassurance and support you would get over your anxieties but has started to suspect that they may be a permanent feature of your psyche. If you are to rescue this relationship it might be useful to address the difficulties you seem to have distinguishing between genuine red flags and situations where your past exacerbates your tendency to overreact and imbue minor events with excessive importance, e.g. a text a few minutes late equating to infidelity. You may be able to do this alone, but therapy would certainly help you overcome historical trauma. The key to future relationships is in your hands. All the best, JAFBaer Dear Ainee, Thank you very much for your letter. I hope you won’t be bored reading my part of the letter. Since I agree with Mr. Baer 100%, I may seem to merely repeat what he’s said. But in the same way Mr. Baer presumes you can discern between actual infidelity and projected infidelity, I too presume you can tell when I show you proof of your unfairness towards Ian (based on your actual words). Honestly, it would have been foolish for me to do that if Mr. Baer had not laid a convincing argument for why you have to change. Changing one’s behavior is difficult, especially if said behavior has worked so well to ease your pain. That is the reason Mr. Baer suggested therapy. However, in case you need convincing to get therapy, I hope quoting your words might give you pause. You wrote, and I quote: “I have a phobia about being lied to. It is not my fault. I think it is merely a reaction to what sort of man my first boyfriend was, how badly he treated me.” Let us stop finding fault, but perhaps focus on whose responsibility it is to stop doing what you do — which is to presume he is guilty even if his behavior does not warrant this. Surely you agree that it is no one else’s responsibility but yours? That is the first thing therapy would help you with. If you no longer need this, then let us look at another of your statement: “He (your ex) is the reason the minute Ian is out of my sight, I get nervous and try to find out exactly where he is.” Actually, this is more of the same. However, the fact that you mention this at least twice in one letter shows the strength of your belief. If you want Ian back, hopefully not as the mealy mouthed man trying to appease you for something he didn’t do, but as an individual who takes responsibility for his actions, and not anybody else’s, then yes, go to therapy OR apologize to Ian and perhaps ask him to flag you whenever you become the old, untrusting you. However, if you don’t change and just want the old Ian back, then I hope to God HE is tired of constantly being blamed and refuses to come back unless you’ve changed. From someone who cares and wishes the best for you (believe it or not). – MG Holmes – Rappler.com",True,true,[Two Pronged] My boyfriend is getting cold toward me,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/two-pronged-boyfriend-getting-cold/,Rappler
"BAGUIO, Philippines – National Artist for Film Kidlat Tahimik’s favorite story of Jose Rizal was when the Spanish government allowed the exhibition of about 40 ethnic Filipinos including Igorots in the Exposición de las Islas Filipinas in the Palacio Cristal in 1887. In his letter to penpal Ferdinand Blumentritt, Rizal wrote about the racial mockery of Spanish newspapers of the Igorots wearing nothing but G-strings until one of them died of pneumonia. Let them die, Rizal wrote in frustration until he settled down and said that at least the Igorots live in harmony with nature, not like the Spaniards who had to create a human zoo. Kidlat, ever playful, said of Rizal: “Beneath his winter coat he wore his bahag.” He had since collected woodcarvings of Rizal (and Bonifacio) wearing a bahag, which he had gifted to some friends. Kidlat exacted revenge for Rizal in 2021 when he set up his Magellan, Marilyn, Mickey & Fr. Dámaso. 500 Years of Conquistador RockStars, at Palacio de Cristal. He filled up the massive space with assemblages of bululs and other Filipino indigenous figures, Spanish conquistadors, and American pop icons like Mickey Mouse and Marilyn Monroe to create his own postcolonial human zoo. Some of these assemblages were shown at the National Museum and some donated “The Trojan Horse” and “The Galleon” at the Mactan-Cebu International Airport (MCIA) Terminals 1 and 2 to complete a weird circumnavigation of sorts. His Rizal assemblages, however, were shown during Rizal’s birthday in June at the Baguio Museum. “Happy Orbit, Pepe,” Kidlat in G-string shouted to the audience. Kidlat Tahimik’s exhibit was one of two in Baguio that celebrated Rizal this year. The other one was Dengcoy Miel’s homecoming exhibit last August at the Bencab Museum entitled “Kathang Ipis.” Dengcoy, a long-time executive artist of The Strait Times in Singapore, retired and came home this year. Like Kidlat, Dengcoy Miel treats Rizal as less a historical subject than a conceptual hinge. The hero becomes a vessel through which questions of power, faith and post-colonial identity can pass. His earlier Rizal portraits like “Rizal in the Land of Lilimut” distill what Miel calls the filibuster spirit of the revolution — defiance sharpened by intellect, resistance fueled not only by arms but by ideas. This is Rizal not as saint, but as provocation, a reminder that dissent is a moral stance as much as a political one. In “Kathang Ipis”, he paired Rizal with Bonifacio, and as political taxonomies go, the National Hero was again portrayed as a pacifist. This was evident in his “Allergic to Violence” and “The Pacifist’s Nightmare” where the bolo becomes literally too hot to handle. His obra maestra in the exhibit, “Walang Katapusang Cuento ng Pighati at Pagdurusa (Revolt-In)” has Rizal and Bonifacio locking arms, while their other hands held a smoldering bolo (for Andres) and a flaming quill (for Jose). Rizal’s measured faith in reason, reform, and the slow labor of words seems present in the work’s reflective pauses while Bonifacio’s raw insistence on rupture and action surges through its more violent, unrelenting imagery. The piece refuses to resolve their debate. Instead, it suggests that Philippine grief is born precisely from this tension: the country’s habit of thinking its way out of pain while simultaneously bleeding through it. For Miel, the sorrow continues as the nation is condemned to carry both Rizal’s lucid sorrow and Bonifacio’s furious anguish at the same locked arms. Kidlat, on the other hand, has Rizal as the supreme “indio-genius,” which is both reclamation and provocation. “Indio,” a colonial slur, is stripped of its insult and fused with intellect, imagination, and resistance. Kidlat always says that it was his late Ifugao friend Lopez Nauyac who taught him that word. Applied to Rizal, the phrase destabilizes the hero’s usual pedestal. Rizal is no longer simply the product of European enlightenment; he becomes a bridge figure, fluent in Western forms yet anchored in native consciousness. Therefore, with a bahag. He imagined Rizal holding a pen in one hand, like Miel, and a camera in the other. The pairing feels autobiographical, of course. What distinguishes both Kidlat and Dengcoy are their refusal of piety. Kidlat’s Rizal protests human zoos, mocks friars, and lingers uncomfortably in the present, where memory is crowded out by noise and novelty. By framing Rizal as inspiration rather than icon, Kidlat argues for a living relationship with history. Miel plays the dyslexic. He said that Kathang Ipis was, of course, a play of isip and he played with it. “Why Kathang Ipis? Probably because our points of view are that of the underling, of men and women still being haunted by the dark shadows of our past. It’s these puns intended that reveals our playful and merry acceptance and shielded defiance to the challenges of the past, present and the future,” he said during the opening. “The paintings in this show hope to crystallize our collective traumas, make peace with them and hopefully learn from them, too.” In revisiting Rizal, Miel, the balikbayan, was also revisiting himself, asking the question that underlies much of his art: not only what Rizal means to Filipinos today, but whether, in an age of distraction and self-inflicted myths, they still deserve him. – Rappler.com",True,true,Kidlat Tahimik and Dengcoy Miel reimagine a hero that we deserve,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/kidlat-tahimik-dengcoy-miel-jose-rizal-exhibits/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has temporarily suspended all its field audits and related operations following calls to investigate an alleged extortion scheme within the agency. BIR Commissioner Charlie Mendoza, in a statement on Monday, November 24, said that the suspension covers the issuance of Letters of Authority (LOAs) and Mission Orders (MOs). LOAs are formal documents that authorize BIR revenue officers to examine a taxpayer’s books of accounts and records for a designated period. Meanwhile, MOs authorize revenue officers to conduct surveillance and inventory-taking activities on business operations. Mendoza said that exceptions will only be given to cases such as active criminal investigations, refund claims that require audits, and immediate action that has been flagged by verified intelligence. The newly appointed tax commissioner described the suspension as a necessary move to protect taxpayers’ rights and strengthen the BIR’s internal processes. Mendoza said he has instructed the creation of a technical working group to evaluate the BIR’s existing procedures and recommend revised LOA protocols. “We take every complaint seriously, and any misuse of authority, harassment, or irregularity has no place in the Bureau,” Mendoza said. Department of Finance Secretary Frederick Go for his part renewed his agency’s commitment to protecting taxpayers from abuse. “All taxpayers shall be treated with the highest degree of professionalism, courtesy, and adherence to the rule of law,” he said. The suspension came just hours after Senator Erwin Tulfo filed a Senate resolution directing the blue ribbon committee to probe the BIR’s alleged extortion scheme involving LOAs. Tulfo said some business owners approached him and other senators, claiming BIR personnel used LOAs to pressure them into “discounted” rates in order to avoid an inflated assessment of their due taxes. The senator also flagged supposed irregularities such as the repeated issuance of LOAs, the use of fake or unauthorized LOAs, and the substitution of MOs to evade scrutiny. He also alleged that the agency’s personnel resorted to this scheme in order to meet the BIR’s collection targets. While Tulfo welcomed the BIR’s suspension, he said the involved tax officials and personnel must still be held accountable for their actions. “I urge the new commissioner to do a reshuffle because from the complaints we received, the regional directors may have a hand in this,” he said. – Rappler.com",True,true,BIR suspends field audits amid calls to probe alleged extortion scheme,https://www.rappler.com/business/bureau-internal-revenue-suspends-field-audits-alleged-extortion-scheme-probe/,Rappler
"BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – SM Prime Holdings Incorporated (SMPH) has withdrawn its proposal to redevelop the Baguio City public market, the city government announced on Saturday, January 3. Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong also confirmed the withdrawal to Rappler in a phone interview, saying he was formally informed of the decision through a letter sent to his office. Details of the withdrawal and its implications for the city’s market rehabilitation plans have yet to be made public. According to a source familiar with the matter, the company was “dismayed over the lies and inaccuracies being circulated,” which it said had negatively affected its corporate image. Part of a December 19, 2025 letter sent to Magalong by SM Prime Holdings showed that the firm decided to withdraw “since it appears that Baguio City, the executive and legislative branches, the BCPM vendors, and other stakeholders in the project have several matters to settle before the project may be undertaken.” The Baguio City government first awarded the project to SMPH in 2020 when the Sy-led developer submitted an unsolicited proposal for the redevelopment. SMPH’s P5.4-billion proposal would include the construction of a seven-storey building and a parking lot that can accommodate around 1,900 vehicles. (READ: Robinsons, SM Prime present plans to redevelop Baguio market) But concerned residents and stakeholders opposed the proposed redevelopment, describing the move as part of the city government’s “blind drive” to privatize public infrastructure and prioritize corporate interests above constituents’ welfare. Vendors also voiced concerns that the redevelopment could negatively impact their livelihoods. The Baguio City Council was initially given until Saturday, January 10, to act on the proposed market development plan. A 120-day period, which began in October last year, includes finalizing the bidding process and gathering input from relevant stakeholders. In a statement, Vice Mayor Faustino Olowan said, “We appreciate the efforts and participation of all parties involved in exploring possibilities for the public market’s enhancement. The Sangguniang Panlungsod remains committed to pursuing initiatives that prioritize the welfare of our constituents and promote continuous development of the City Public Market, aligned with the needs and aspirations of our Baguio community, and in adherence to the ‘Baguio First’ policy doctrine and Vendors’ Bill of Rights.” – Rappler.com",True,true,SM Prime withdraws Baguio public market redevelopment proposal,https://www.rappler.com/business/sm-prime-withdraws-baguio-public-market-redevelopment-proposal/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – A “small majority” of adult Filipinos want the immediate passage of a law banning political dynasties in the Philippines, the latest survey of Pulse Asia Research, Incorporated shows. The results of the nationwide survey released on Monday, December 29, also showed that agreement on the passage of the long-proposed measure is lowest in Mindanao. “The predominant sentiment among Filipino adults (54%) is one of agreement with the Congress immediately passing a law banning political dynasties in the country. This observation also holds true in Metro Manila (69%), the rest of Luzon (59%), the Visayas (59%), and Class D (57%),” Pulse Asia said in a press statement on Monday, December 29. “Public opinion on the matter is split three (3) ways in Mindanao (34% agreement, 38% indecision, and 27% disagreement),” the pollster added. The survey showed that more Filipinos are undecided over their agreement or disagreement with the immediate passage of an anti-dynasty law (27%) compared to those who disagree with it (18%). The survey was done from December 12 to 15, or days after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. urged Congress to prioritize passing an anti-dynasty bill. Critics dismissed the move as a mere publicity stunt because if the President was really serious about the speedy passage of the measure, he would have certified it as urgent. There are 11 anti-dynasty bills filed in the 20th Congress including, ironically, from the biggest dynasts including presidential son House Majority Leader Sandro Marcos, and House Speaker Bojie Dy. But studied further, only a few of these bills are genuine anti-dynasty measures. Sandro and Dy filed a joint bill that, if passed, would not have any significant effect on their political clans. In their proposed bill, what is only prohibited are family members up to the fourth degree of consanguinity holding office in the same level or jurisdiction. The Marcos-Dy bill, if applied to the current Marcos political dynasty, would only affect two people. For example, on the national level, either President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. or Senator Imee Marcos can serve, while Sandro and his uncles — Leyte 1st District Representative Martin Romualdez and Ilocos Norte 2nd District Representative Angelo Marcos Barba — can still serve simultaneously as they represent different districts. In Ilocos Norte, only one between Governor Cecilia Araneta Marcos and Matthew Marcos Manotoc can serve. The bills filed by the opposition bloc, particularly by Makabayan and Akbayan, prohibit family members up to the fourth degree of consanguity from holding any national or local elective office. The bills also prohibit immediate succession to a family member. There has been a momentum in the anti-political dynasty movement led by the young members of political families themselves, including Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto, although their coalition’s version is more lenient than those of Makabayan and Akbayan. At least 71 of the country’s 82 provincial governments or 87% are led by members of political dynasties, according to research by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ). The 1987 Constitution prohibits political dynasties. Article II, Section 26 says: “The State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law.” However, there is no enabling law to define it. Congress, which must pass this bill, is full of dynasts (8 in every 10 district representatives before the last elections), and the President who must sign it into law is a dynast himself. There are petitions before the Supreme Court asking it to compel Congress to pass the enabling law and to, quite literally, do their job and follow the Constitution. The last one has been pending in the Supreme Court since April 2025. The same Pulse Asia survey showed that 52% of Filipinos want Congress to pass a law to create a “fully empowered” Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI). There was a groundswell in the country for the anti-dynasty movement along with increasing interest in the investigation of the flood control scandal. Some of the public officials who are under investigation, or at who have at least been recommended for investigation, belong to political dynasties who are also contractors. However, momentum has slowed down with the ICI not live-streaming all of its hearings, as some subjects requested executive sessions. To make matters worse, two out of three ICI commissioners have resigned, leaving only the chair — retired SC justice Andres Reyes — to run it.

"Fun foodie adventures are something many look forward to as a way to bond with the family. It’s where great conversations take place, and where our family and friends find themselves laughing or maybe even shedding a tear or two around the table over our bonding sessions. No matter the cuisine or fare, it’s always about connection. Savoring the memories around the table is where love and togetherness truly come alive. But for our family of six, it’s not just about the destination or the dish, it’s also about the journey. And with that, I’m excited to highlight the journey — or in this case, the road trip — when getting “there” is just as much fun as the meal. We recently had the privilege to take the new Ford Explorer 2.3L Limited 4×4 for a spin as we ran errands for a week, went back and forth to work, invested in date night, and even took the whip out for a little road trip to Tagaytay. Nino was able to really let it out on the road with the power and precision of the Ford Explorer’s engine and handling. The meals we enjoyed in between driving to our different appointments and stops made for a FUN Ford Food Crawl with the whole family. The Ford Explorer is perfect for a family adventure, no matter the season. With the sleek handling, it commands the road in the rain and keeps us cool in the heat of the summer. Equipped with premium comfort and advanced safety features, The New Explorer is built for drivers to command the road while keeping the family safe. Whether traveling in the city and navigating the tight turns of Manila’s urban landscape or heading out to the province, making a rough road an easy drive, it embodies the strength and versatility of American ingenuity while delivering a smooth and comfortable ride for the whole family. In fact, that rainy night that we reserved a table for two at one of the best Filipino restaurants right here in Manila brought together American ingenuity and Filipino creativity to a whole new level of understanding for this Fil-Am. Run by husband-wife team Chef Jordy and Mia Navarra, Toyo Eatery has been included in the exclusive list of Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants since 2018 and featured in Somebody Feed Phil earlier this year. With a heritage menu that provides opportunities for storytelling and a commitment to supporting local farmers and artisans, Chef Jordy continues to defy expectations of just how satisfying a Kamayan Feast can be when tradition meets thoughtful innovation. Meant to be enjoyed through a progression of bites, soup, appetizers, and ulam, served family style on banana leaves, each savory comes to the table with a meaningful back story. Honoring his childhood and rich culture of flavors, Chef Jordy brings diners through a joyful meal best enjoyed with family and friends. This is, by far, one of the best Kamayan meals Nino and I have ever experienced. After our trio of bites, we were served a series of five kinds of dried fish atop freshly steamed rice, beautifully gift-wrapped in banana leaf for that comforting, homegrown touch. The beauty of this second part of our meal was that it was immediately followed by the mains, which included plump, sweet fresh prawns sourced from Palawan, a crispy pata that was incredibly tender yet finished with the crispiest skin for that ultimate crunch satisfaction, and a classic pork BBQ offering an elevated experience with pork shoulder, belly, and butt, topped with a rich soy glaze and a char of smokiness. With each course, Nino and I were thoroughly entertained and inspired by the multiple layers of flavors, texture, and creative artistry on a banana leaf. From the curated cocktails to the dessert, where Nino shared with our server that it was the best avocado ice cream he had had in his life, this was a date night hard to forget. Safely riding home, the rain did not affect our short trip back to BGC, thanks to the Ford Explorer’s confidence-inspiring safety features that keep precious cargo secure no matter the weather. It was time to shift gears for Sunday funday with the family by taking a ride to Tagaytay for a simple lunch after service. Our family always enjoys road trips, and the Ford Explorer is the perfect fit for a family of six. Roomy interiors provide maximum space and ease. Nino was able to open up the strength as we hit the highway to one of our favorite “out of town” destinations. With pastas and sammies that are simple and satisfying, we were blessed with some sunny weather, good food, great music (we loved the playlist in the cafe), amidst the greenery and fresh air. Even if it is on a busy main road, it felt peaceful and tucked away. Driving the Ford Explorer for a week’s worth of errands, activities, events, and meals provided opportunities for convenience and connection. Whether it was Nino taking the wheel for a family cruise outside of Metro Manila or one of my meetings for the ADCOM for Learners with Disabilities, we moved in comfort and confidence. Surely safe for the family, for date night, and for every journey in between.“I love that the new Ford Explorer gives me the thrill of performance and handling I look for as a car enthusiast, but at the same time, it delivers the safety and peace of mind I need as a dad,” Nino said. “The advanced safety features reassure me when my family is with me. I also appreciate the spacious luxury interior and smart tech that make family trips smoother and more fun. For me, it’s rare to find an SUV that balances excitement, road presence, and practicality. This is a vehicle I can truly trust for both driving in the city and going out of town.” Easy to drive with a 10-speed automatic transmission, but even easier to ride as a passenger with creature comforts necessary of a “passenger princess,” including both heated and air conditioned seats, this Ford model also features ample leg room, outlets to charge phones or work on the laptop in the back seat, cup holders for both my coffee and my lemon water, and a magnetic charging station, while keeping my family safe. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Kitchen 143] A family food crawl with the Ford Explorer,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/kitchen-143-family-food-crawl-ford-explorer/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines imported a total of 3.37 million metric tons (MT) of rice in 2025, down 30% from 2024’s 4.8 million MT, according to latest data from the Bureau of Plant Industry. The dip was the result of the government’s four-month suspension on rice imports beginning September until end of the year, resorted to supposedly protect local farmers selling palay at peak harvest season. Department of Agriculture spokesman Arnel de Mesa said Thursday, January 8, that the import suspension “proved that even without imported rice, there was no swift increase [in prices].” “What this means is the rice that enters the country is beyond what we need,” De Mesa said in a mix of Filipino and English. In December, the country imported just 27,000 MT of rice, the lowest volume in 2025, compared with 505,000 MT in May, the year’s peak. The country resumed rice importations January 2026 and has imposed a flexible tariff scheme ranging from 15% to 35%. According to Executive Order No. 105, there will be an increase in rice import duty by five percentage points per five percent decrease in international rice prices. In 2024, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. lowered rice tariffs from 35% to 15% to tame prices. – Rappler.com",True,true,Rice imports down to 3.37 million MT in 2025,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/rice-imports-down-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Twenty Philippine business groups are supporting bills that would create an independent body more empowered than the Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) established by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. In a joint statement on Wednesday, December 10, the 20 groups urged the Senate and the House of Representatives to pass the following: The business groups also urged Marcos to certify these bills as urgent. “A fully empowered IPC (Independent People’s Commission) or ICAIC ( Independent Commission Against Infrastructure Corruption) will strengthen the capacity of the Ombudsman and the Department of Justice to pursue corruption cases more effectively and restore credibility to the pursuit of integrity in public service. At present, the ICI functions only in an advisory capacity. It may request the presence of resource persons and recommend courses of action — whether the filing of charges, the seizure of assets, or the issuance of hold-departure orders — but it cannot act decisively on its own,” the business groups said. They said the IPC or ICAIC will have “full investigative and prosecutorial powers” including: “At a time when blatant and widespread misuse of public funds has eroded confidence in our institutions, our nation is confronting a profound crisis of public trust. The Filipino people deserve nothing less than the full truth,” they said. “A truly independent IPC or ICAIC will guarantee transparency and accountability — no cover-up, no sacred cow, no political maneuvering. It will safeguard the people’s money and help rebuild the people’s trust that is essential to a healthy democracy,” they added. On Tuesday, December 9, the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC) included the Independent People’s Commission Act as one of 48 measures in the Common Legislative Agenda for the 20th Congress. The three other reform measures on transparent and accountable governance are: Anti-Dynasty Bill; Party-list System Reform Act; and the Citizen Access and Disclosure of Expenditures for National Accountability (CADENA) Act. In a Department of Economy Planning and Development (DEPDev) media release, the government said Senate Bill No. 1512 on the Independent People’s Commission will consist of five members: 1) a retired Supreme Court justice as chairperson; 2) a Certifiied Public Accountant; 3) an engineer or an architect; 4) a representative from a reputable non-governmental organization; and 5) a representative from the academe. It can conduct motu proprio investigations; issue subpoenas; access records, sites, contracts, and documents; recommend and request freezing of assets; and issue immediate preventive suspension orders against government officials involved. In addition, it will have powers to enter into memoranda of agreement with the Ombudsman, Commission on Audit, Department of Justice (DOJ), and other agencies for joint investigations, cooperative mechanisms, and data sharing. Former public works secretary Rogelio Singson, who resigned from the ICI effective December 15, had lamented the lack of powers of the ICI. He also said the Philippines was way behind countries that have institutionalized anti-corruption bodies.

"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Francisco Ed. Lim issued last week a draft circular for comments from the public until October 15 to address the continuing threat posed by the present structure of tenure of independent directors with respect to the exercise of their objectivity and independence. This new rule is to take effect on January 1, 2026. Under Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 4, Series of 2017, which is SEC’s current applicable regulation on the subject, independent directors may serve for a maximum cumulative term of nine years. After reaching this nine-year limit, they are permanently — as in perpetually — barred from serving in that capacity for that company. However, individuals who have served as independent directors can still be elected as non-independent directors in the same company after they have served the nine-year term limit or as independent directors in a different company, provided they meet the requirements for those roles. In the instance that a company wants to retain an independent director who has served for nine years, the board of directors of the company may appeal the matter to the SEC, at the same time, provide a “meritorious justification/s and seek shareholders’ approval during the annual shareholders’ meeting.” These rules do not only apply to independent directors of publicly listed companies but to all private companies and registered issuers. The basis for counting the maximum cumulative nine-year term of the independent directors under the current rules was from 2012, with any fraction of a year served counted as a full year. Independent directors are not also necessarily elected annually. Their election can be structured in a staggered basis like one, two, or three years. In this way, their positions do not expire all at the same time. Previous to SEC MC No. 4, Series of 2017, the governing rule on the duration and term limit for independent directors was covered by SEC MC No. 9, Series of 2011, otherwise known as the “5-2-5” rule. Under the “5-2-5” rule, independent directors can serve for five consecutive years. After completion of the five-year period, the independent director shall be ineligible for election. The independent directors have to undergo a “cooling-off” period of two years. During this time, they must not be engaged in any activity that would disqualify them from being an independent director in the company. After the cooling-off period, the same independent directors may be again re-elected for the next final five-year period — for a maximum total of 10 years. Under the upcoming changes, the SEC will continue to adopt the policy in which companies may elect independent directors with different terms. The reason behind this staggered approach is obviously to ensure that not all positions expire in the same year, providing stability to the board. As illustrated in the draft circular, this is how the position of independent directors is filled up on a staggered basis: if a company has five independent directors, the company may opt to elect two nominees with 3-year terms, another two nominees with 2-year terms, with the last nominee for a term of one year. After a year, the one with a one-year term will expire and a new independent director will be elected for a three-year term. At the end of the second year, two positions will also expire and two new independent directors will be elected for three-year term; and so on. The draft circular is likewise moving towards the continuation of the three-year fixed term for independent directors with a maximum cumulative period term limit of nine years (reckoned from 2012 as provided under SEC Memorandum Circular No. 19, series of 2016, and SEC Memorandum Circular No. 24, series of 2019). The three-year fixed term cuts off the practice of indefinite reappointments that can weaken the objectivity of independent directors, as well their independence. Again, any fraction of a year shall be considered as one full year, regardless of the manner or reason by which the position of an independent director was relinquished or vacated. Moreover, independent directors who fail to maintain their qualifications and/or has become disqualified at the time of serving their term, they are required to immediately vacate their position. The possible penalties for companies that violate any of the mandatory provisions of these upcoming changes will be subject to a basic fine of P1 million for non-adoption of the three-year fixed term for independent directors, P1 million basic fine for breach of the term limit of nine years plus P100,000 fine monthly until the violation is cured, and P1 million plus P100,000 monthly penalty for failure to vacate upon disqualification. In the draft circular, too, independent directors will be essentially elected for a three-year term up to a total of three terms equivalent to nine years, and their position is filled during the annual meeting when that term expires. Independent director positions should have different terms, so some may expire one year and others the next. Lim is optimistic that the new structure of tenure for independent directors will promote good governance. He is also confident that with the proposed changes, independent directors are protected from sudden removal when they fight for something which they believe is right even if it is not consistent with what the controlling shareholders are thinking. With the strict capping of the maximum term limit of independent directors at nine years, Lim expects that this will give other companies the opportunity to benefit from their expertise. At the same time, this will generally foster the use of more available talents, too. But come to think of it, despite all this present effort to support independent directors to fortify their position against compromised decision-making, records continue to show that their role in providing an effective solution in the fight against questionable internal management pressure that has led to poor financial performance or even outright business failure still continues to be elusive. – Rappler.com (The article has been prepared for general circulation for the reading public and must not be construed as an offer, or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or financial instruments whether referred to herein or otherwise.

"MANILA, Philippines – If you’re looking for a New Year’s resolution that will still matter when the year’s excitement fades, retirement is a good place to start, even if it feels a little premature this early in January. More specifically, PERA is one tool worth looking at. PERA, or the Personal Equity and Retirement Account, is designed to help you build a steady retirement investing habit, with tax perks that ordinary investing doesn’t offer. It isn’t a new type of fund in itself, but instead a legal framework created under the PERA Act of 2008 that sets the rules and incentives for how your retirement money is invested. If you’re familiar with the 401(k) system in the US, it’s basically the Philippines’ version of that retirement account. Though it’s been introduced as a concept for almost two decades now, PERA products only really began rolling out years later, as providers built products and went through accreditation. For example, the Bank of the Philippine Island’s (BPI) PERA Money Market Fund lists December 19, 2016 as its launch date, which gives you a sense of how long it took for mainstream offerings to show up. Then came the more modern layer. The government and private sector started pushing “digital PERA” distribution, including platforms that let investors open and manage PERA accounts online. One milestone is the launch of the country’s first digital PERA platform in September 2020, which was framed as a way to widen access and reduce friction for retail savers. Since then, more players have entered the space, including firms that aren’t banks. DragonFi, for instance, is a securities broker that now offers PERA account access through its platform, which reflects how PERA has gradually expanded beyond traditional bank channels. But before anything else, let’s clear out two questions you might have. “Will this make me rich?” No retirement vehicle can honestly promise that. “Will this make my investing more efficient?” That is what PERA is designed to do. PERA cannot guarantee gains, but it can make the gains you do earn more valuable by reducing the tax drag that usually chips away at investment income. PERA is also voluntary. You can open one on your own, and an employer may offer a PERA program, but it is not mandatory in the way SSS contributions are. A PERA account is not an investment by itself. It is a container that holds retirement investments, under a set of rules. Those rules cover who can offer PERA products, what kinds of investments are allowed, what tax benefits apply, and when you can withdraw without losing perks. When you put money into PERA, your money does not sit there doing nothing. It gets invested into qualified PERA investment products. This distinction matters because PERA is often misunderstood as a special fund. In reality, it is closer to a retirement account that can hold different funds and instruments, as long as they fit the eligibility rules. That said, here is the “menu” a PERA account is allowed to invest in according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP): UITF units, mutual fund shares, annuity contracts, insurance pension products, pre-need pension plans, listed shares traded on a local exchange, exchange-traded bonds, and government securities, plus other categories that regulators may allow under specific conditions That’s speaking legally. Practically though, what a typical retail investor can actually buy today under PERA is narrower, and usually centers on PERA-qualified funds such as money market, bond, and equity UITFs. This is also why PERA isn’t a loophole to get any investment you want tax-free. For instance, while some administrators may have certain PERA-eligible stocks for you to invest in, you cannot just pick any stock, any REIT, or any bond you personally like and drop it into a PERA wrapper. So if you are the kind of reader who wants to build a retirement portfolio made of individual stocks and bonds, PERA may still feel restrictive depending on which provider you choose and what they offer right now. That, however, is not a reason to dismiss it outright, especially considering its benefits. The reason PERA stays compelling is its tax treatment. PERA’s advantages boil down to three things: a 5% tax credit on qualified contributions, tax-exempt investment income, and tax-free withdrawals upon qualified retirement, plus a legal protection that treats PERA assets differently for insolvency and estate purposes. The easiest benefit to visualize is the tax credit because it behaves like a rebate on what you put in. The PERA Act provides a tax credit equivalent to 5% of your total qualified PERA contributions made in a year, subject to annual contribution limits of P200,000 per year for locally employed and self-employed individuals, and P400,000 per year for overseas Filipinos. Here is what the tax credit looks like in practice. If you contribute P100,000 this year, the tax credit is P5,000. If you max out P200,000, the tax credit becomes P10,000, and if you are an overseas Filipino contributing P400,000, it becomes P20,000. Those tax credits are valid within five years from issuance and can be used to pay or reduce your income tax. The second benefit is one that compounds over time: the income earned from PERA investments is exempt from taxes on investment income. Suppose you have a bond fund that earns P20,000 in investment income in a year. In a normal taxable setting, part of that income may be subject to taxes depending on the instrumen. The actual money that you get is less the tax withheld, which is usually around 20%. When you keep that investment in PERA, the framework is designed so that qualifying investment income can stay inside the account without those investment-income taxes applying the same way, which means more of the return remains invested and compounding. The third benefit is less talked about, but it matters for peace of mind and long-term planning. The PERA Act states that PERA assets are not considered assets of the contributor for purposes of insolvency and estate taxes, and it also emphasizes non-assignability, meaning these assets generally can’t be attached, garnished, or seized. In simple terms, PERA is structured to be harder to reach in financial distress, and cleaner to pass on in certain scenarios, which can help it play a role in estate planning. The BSP’s PERA FAQ reinforces this framing and notes that distributions upon death are covered under the rules. Remember, PERA is built for retirement. That means it has a definition of what retirement looks like in its rules. To get the tax-free distributions, you have to meet the “55 and 5” rule: you’ve reached age 55 and have completed at least five yearly contributions. If you withdraw earlier, you forfeit the tax incentives you’ve enjoyed, with all taxes repaid to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). This includes the 20% tax on total income earned and the 5% tax credit that you’ve received. There are, however, important exceptions. Withdrawal penalties don’t apply in cases such as accident or illness-related hospitalization in excess of 30 days, permanent total disability, and certain transfers to another PERA investment product and or another administrator within a specified window. Though this might seem like a tricky restriction, it can also help in building your retirement fund. A normal investment account is liquid. Ordinary investment accounts are liquid, and liquidity is convenient but tempting. PERA adds healthy friction, which makes it easier to leave your retirement money alone, and it works best when you treat contributions as a long-term habit. – Rappler.com Finterest is Rappler’s series that demystifies the world of money and gives practical advice on managing your personal finances.",True,true,"[Finterest] What is PERA, the Philippines’ 401(k)-style retirement account?",https://www.rappler.com/business/finterest-things-to-know-pera-philippines-retirement-account/,Rappler
"Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer, I was happy and surprised to see my letter chosen for last week’s column. There’s a lot to process in your answer. I guess we can say family dysfunction is not the only measure to ascertain compatibility with a potential partner. Just like now we live in a world where “2-Factor Authentication” is preferred right? Hehe. For sure, I won’t be using that as “a great divider” to filter out the pool. I do agree that it rather depends on how much information one needs to make an informed decision. I can be presented with a woman who fits that filter and my discretion would be to ask myself “Am I still comfortable with this person?” or “Am I taken aback but I don’t want prejudice to get my better judgment so I need more information?” I do believe people can change for the better. I haven’t thought of my previous partners any less! I just chalked it up to they had a bad past and just moved on to how I can show love to them and express that I care. It’s only now after the relationship ended that I feel like I subconsciously give more attention to a certain type? Or that my fate or luck has paired me to a certain type? At the end of the day, I do not claim my hypothesis is perfectly fair. It sounded fair based on my past experiences and my fears of it repeating. But I am grateful for the opportunity that we can discuss it further for us to be on the same page. Likewise if I were to be rejected based on socio-economic background or anything under the sun like my height, or age, or one innocent comment that a girl would perceive as offensive to her, that will be on them. It may or may not be fair. It may or may not be pragmatic, but I’ll take it as their preference and just move on with my day. Thank you once more, Sam Dear Sam, It is encouraging to know that you are open to a broader selection process when it comes to choosing potential partners. There are innumerable suggestions as to how to go about this but basically it is a question of aligning your selection criteria with the development of the relationship. For example, you might favor a certain age group, certain physical characteristics (height, build etc.), compatibility of values, sharing a similar approach to conflict resolution, an understanding that you both agree that you should accept each other as you are and not insist on radical changes, and the like. Clearly, the emphasis on these varies as the relationship goes through its phases such as honeymoon (the first few months), adjustment, commitment, acceptance. While you may develop a framework that makes absolute sense, it is important to leave room for flexibility. The world is full of people who thought they had a specific “type” yet ended up with someone totally different. In addition, it is important not to reduce the whole process to a kind of spreadsheet analysis. This is after all a romantic relationship and beyond the purely rational there needs to be a physical and emotional connection that cannot be reduced simply to an Excel sheet. All the best, JAF Baer Dear Sam: Thank you very much for your letter. I must admit it was pretty difficult to answer your letter above. I think one reason is that it was very logical and rational, and who can really add to something that makes as much sense as you do? And then I realized what was missing was what Mr. Baer underscored in his last paragraph, that “This is, after all, a romantic relationship and beyond the purely rational there needs to be a physical and emotional connection that cannot be reduced simply to an Excel sheet,” and he is right, isn’t he? Right about the fact that, when you think about it, that “X” factor is sometimes what is missing when one wonders why someone does not end up with someone everyone thought was perfect for him. The X factor wasn’t there. I am not saying that “X” means sex. Neither am I saying that “X” is the most important thing in the relationship. But usually, when people talk about romance and taking a risk with all you have so you can be with someone for the rest of your life, then “X” is necessarily part of the equation. A necessary, but not sufficient, reason. “X” isn’t sex alone, but it sure can help a lot. In fact, the sociologist and noted feminist scholar Jessie Bernard once said that a reason sex is so good in the first year (years?) of marriage is that it is the glue that keeps the couple together through all the hardship and all the stress of sleepless nights and endless worry. These sleepless nights and endless worry may be due to a combination of factors: the baby who won’t stop crying, the only job that pays enough but is super toxic, the pressures of establishing one’s self and one’s partner as a unit capable of financial and emotional independence. Sam, I can already hear you asking incredulously: “Surely you’re not saying terrific sex is the only thing that matters?!!?” Absolutely not. But then again, it sure helps. This is where your “2-factor authentication” is also necessary. And perhaps, the more terrific the sex, the more factors you have to take into account. In the end, love is what matters and not sex. But sex can be one way of discovering why you are in love with this person. The psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Ethel Person once said: “Love is an act of imagination. For some of us, it will be the greatest creative triumph of our lives.” Dr. Person also said, “People should not judge failed love affairs as failed experiences, but as part of the growth process. Something does not have to end well for it to have been one of the most valuable experiences of a lifetime.” My litmus test is “if you are willing to do/be for another person what you would not do for anybody else, then they are probably it.” Mr. Baer’s is: “The physical and emotional connection cannot be reduced simply to an Excel sheet (unlike mere reason and logic).” At the risk of seeming mayabang (arrogant), I can’t help feeling that you could do a lot worse than keeping in mind the words of Jessie Bernard, Jeremy Baer, Margarita Holmes, and Ethel Person when choosing a partner.

"Filipino businessman and former politician Manny Villar didn’t help his own case when, in an earlier media interview, he waved off, unchallenged, the need for rigorous valuation models. “Just multiply 3,500 hectares times the value, you can get the price,” he said — spouting off a sort of pure-vibe, offhand arithmetic one expects from a casual cocktail-napkin scribble, not from a publicly listed conglomerate that presumes its scale grants it immunity from scrutiny – or a bar-side shorthand rather than disciplined corporate finance — revealing a confidence born less of rigor than of the belief that regulators will simply look away. Capital markets do not run on aspirational arithmetic. They run on discounted cash flows, zoning realities, infrastructure timelines, market absorption curves, and actual comparable sales. What Villar offered was not a valuation method. And in a year that demanded precision, that kind of elementary math was exactly the red flag regulators could no longer ignore. For more than a decade, the Villar Group embodied the Filipino aspirational narrative: a self-made billionaire building a sprawling empire of homes, malls, water utilities, supermarkets, and power assets, anchored by one of the fastest-growing property ecosystems in the country. Its founder, businessman Manuel “Manny” Bamba Villar Jr. previously served as senator from 2001 to 2013 and as the 25th President of the Senate of the Philippines from 2006 to 2008. His ascent to the summit of the country’s wealth rankings seemed inevitable, supported by a constellation of businesses that fed into one another with remarkable efficiency. Investors admired the group’s ability to scale. Regulators, for the most part, kept their distance. And the public regarded the Villar brand as omnipresent — sometimes controversially so, but undeniably powerful. In 2025, the Villar Group became the center of the most momentous corporate reckoning the Philippines has seen in decades. The catalyst was a single number — ₱1.33 trillion — the headline valuation assigned to newly acquired land inside Villar City. What was initially disclosed as a triumph of scale and vision quickly unraveled when auditor Punongbayan & Araullo refused to sign off on the fair-value adjustments, prompting the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to examine the appraisal methodology. E-Value, the firm responsible for the trillion-peso figure, was later sanctioned after investigators found that its valuation reports did not comply with International Valuation Standards. The result was the forced erasure of almost the entire revaluation gain, collapsing Villar Land’s unaudited asset size of ₱1.37 trillion to an audited figure of barely ₱35.7 billion. (READ: Villar Land’s paper empire unravels ) The impact was immediate and brutal. Villar Land’s stock plummeted by more than 80%, vaporizing an estimated US$18 billion in paper wealth and knocking off Manny Villar from the top of the country’s billionaire rankings. A company once positioned as the next major Philippine property heavyweight had to confront a new identity: the most prominent valuation cautionary tale in recent memory. (READ: Manny Villar is now Philippines’ richest) Yet the valuation debacle was only one fault line in a year defined by unraveling reputational capital. PrimeWater, for so long the quiet cash engine of the Villar empire, entered the spotlight for the wrong reasons. Its aggressive joint ventures with water districts — once heralded as a template for private-sector participation — attracted growing scrutiny from lawmakers, regulators, and local stakeholders who questioned service quality, tariff changes, and contractual fairness. Profitability remained strong, rising from ₱196 million in 2017 to nearly ₱1.8 billion in 2023, but profitability alone could no longer insulate the company from intensifying political and social pressure. By mid-2025, several water districts were openly seeking contract reviews or termination, and the administration signaled a willingness to revisit long-standing arrangements that had previously been considered untouchable. In the power sector, the narrative darkened further. SIPCOR — another Villar-controlled utility — lost its permit to operate in Siquijor after the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) determined that it had failed to deliver on mandated service improvements. The decision was administratively symbolic. For the first time, the state took the extraordinary step of revoking a Villar asset’s operating authority, sending a message that even the most politically connected conglomerates must meet regulatory performance standards. Investors saw it as confirmation that the era of passive oversight was over. Even the group’s retail arm, AllDay Marts, is melting, feeling the weight of the shifting tide. Once marketed as the Villar Group’s modern retail champion, AllDay suffered a revenue decline to ₱9.25 billion and a drop in net income to ₱268 million. The market reacted quickly. The stock, which debuted at ₱0.60 during the 2021 initial public offering (IPO) hype, now trades at a fraction of that price, with its market capitalization shrinking by roughly 70% from its peak. (READ: Leadership shakeup in Villar’s AllDay, AllHome as chiefs step down) In isolation, AllDay’s performance might be attributed to industry competition or post-pandemic normalization. But in the context of Villar Land’s valuation scandal and PrimeWater’s political exposure, the decline became part of a broader narrative: a conglomerate premium turning into a government discount. What makes the Villar story uniquely instructive is that its decline was not triggered by external shocks or macroeconomic collapse. It was driven by internal ascendancy tensions colliding with a regulatory environment newly determined to assert authority. For years, the Villar Group benefited from tightly integrated business units and political fluency. The model worked — until auditors, regulators, and investors demanded greater transparency, and the group’s interlocking structure suddenly magnified risk instead of dispersing it. The data tells the story of a spectacular inversion. A conglomerate that once enjoyed a reputation score of 9 out of 10 among institutional watchers witnessed the score fall to a mere 3 out of 10 by 2025. Risk indicators that hovered at low, stable levels a few years ago climbed sharply as controversies accumulated: PrimeWater’s joint venture agreement (JVA) disputes, SIPCOR’s service failures, Villar Land’s accounting restatement, and the sudden collapse of investor confidence. The market-cap curve for both Villar Land and AllDay illustrates the scale of the reputational correction. What was once a symbol of unchecked expansion became a case study in regulatory assertiveness. For global investors assessing Philippine markets, this year’s Villar saga is far more significant than one family’s financial turbulence. It is a vivid demonstration that Philippine regulators are beginning to bare genuine teeth — and that the country’s capital markets may finally be entering a phase where valuation discipline, service performance, and accounting integrity matter as much as political access. (READ: The rise of Cynthia Villar: How politics, money, networks made her No. 1) The irony is striking: the Villar Group’s fall from its once-untouchable position may end up strengthening the Philippines’ investment narrative rather than weakening it. By asserting control over valuation practices, utility performance, and public accountability, regulators have signaled a shift toward more credible market oversight. And conglomerates with weak governance structures are now on notice. In the end, the year that humbled the Villar Group may be remembered not simply as the story of a billionaire empire under pressure, but as a defining moment when Philippine institutions began to rebalance the scales between influence and accountability. The empire is far from collapsing, but the mythology surrounding it has. What remains is a conglomerate forced into transparency, a regulatory system emboldened, and a market newly awakened to the cost of governance risk. The coming year will be pivotal for the Villar conglomerate, and investors are already parsing the signals that will determine whether the group begins to recover or continues to weather the consequences of its own excesses. Foremost is the need for Villar Land to finally deliver a fully normalized balance sheet — one built on audited numbers, transparent related-party disclosures, and valuation practices grounded in conservative, defensible methodologies. Until the company sheds the ghost of its trillion-peso appraisal debacle, the market will remain reluctant to re-rate the stock. Just as crucial is the fate of PrimeWater, where quiet but persistent reports of talks with the MVP group, the Philippine-based conglomerate led by Manny V. Pangilinan, could lead to an asset sale or a joint operating platform. Such a move could help reduce the Villar conglomerate’s political and regulatory exposure, but only if the structure of the deal confronts the thornier realities of liabilities, service obligations, and the consumer-protection issues that have dogged the utility across multiple provinces. Any attempt to offload risk without addressing these fundamentals will only prolong the reputational drag. A third test lies in the operational turnaround of AllDay and whatever successor entities emerge from the remains of SIPCOR’s revoked franchise. Margin stabilization in retail and credible improvements in power and water service delivery would signal that the group is capable not merely of defending its empire, but of rebuilding it through performance rather than proximity to power. Success here would help shift the narrative away from governance failures toward genuine reform. For now, the Villar saga stands as a stark reminder that even the country’s most entrenched commercial empires can be repriced overnight, and that in emerging markets, reputation is not an abstract concept, but a balance-sheet item waiting to be marked to market the moment regulators decide the math no longer adds up. The Villar story reminds us of the dangers of overconfidence and recklessness. The empire’s plight mirrors the story of Icarus, a figure in Greek mythology, famous for his death when he flew too close to the sun using the wings his father Daedalus made from feathers and wax. It may very well be the best business story of the year. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] The Villar empire: From untouchable to a governance test case,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-manny-villar-empire-governance-test-case/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — For many Filipinos, coffee isn’t just a drink — it’s part of a daily rhythm that shapes their day. Cafés have become extensions of homes, schools, and offices, where people rush in for their morning fix or linger with laptops and books in hand. Amid this thriving café culture in the city, one local brand that began as a pandemic delivery venture is changing pace. After years of catering to customers on the go through compact kiosks, Dot Coffee opened its biggest and first physical space in Makati City — a sign of how small players are adapting to Filipinos’ evolving coffee habits. Unlike previous outlets that cater to order pick-ups, this new al fresco branch in Three Central Mall, Salcedo Village, Makati City, aims to turn a quick coffee stop into a much more relaxed stay, where people can customize drinks, savor pastries, and worry less about being on the “dot.” Dot Coffee operated under MadEats, a delivery-only restaurant group founded by Mikee Villareal, Keisha Lao, and Andie Cruz during the COVID-19 pandemic. At a time when people began finding comfort and convenience in ordering food and beverages online, MadEats took the opportunity to expand its “cloud kitchen” concept. In a 2021 interview with Rappler, Villareal defined what a “cloud kitchen” is. “There’s no storefront. Usually, meals are sold digitally, there are no waiters, no dining areas — it’s just food concepts that are being made there and out there for delivery.” “We had a few brands like Korean Fried Chicken and Rice Meals, but at the end of the day, we thought that we really wanted — because we were working so closely together — a good coffee source,” shared Lao with Rappler. As of 2025, the brand is no longer operating under MadEats. As Filipinos slowly began going out and enjoying in-person experiences after the pandemic, Dot Coffee soon adapted from a delivery-only model into its first physical kiosk in Bonifacio Global City back in 2022. “The biggest change here is the setup,” explained Lao. “In our brand DNA, it’s really just like grab-and-go — it’s always just take out. We really wanted to add seats and tables to make it conducive for guests to hang out and even work here.” With a tropical modernist design, the café fuses an earthy wooden ambiance with tall plants, shimmering gold accents, and its signature Dot Coffee blue, which electrifies the minimalist space with a shot of color. The curved couches are best for small groups, and the silver bar stools are fit for couples and individuals, but if work is life for you, the side tables can also serve as a temporary desk (with sockets, too). Before you line up at the front, you’ll also notice the pastry selection on display: salt bread, ‘roni pizza dagel, HEC dagel, everything dagel, corned beef pandesal, and mushroom spinach pandesal. And if you’re wondering what a dagel is — think the “lovechild” of a doughnut and a bagel, as Lao explained. And as Dot Coffee expands from home deliveries to real-world spaces, it’s also embracing a more mindful and responsible approach to in-person dining. Their Go Green Policy encourages customers to skip straws altogether, though those who prefer one can purchase one for P1. Waste disposal is also made easy, as trash cans are already integrated into the café’s design. At the heart of the new experience is customization, where customers can personalize their drinks how they like them. With the menu’s “craft your own” section, you only need to pick a drink (from Dot’s classic or signature beverages), a milk type (oat, almond, or dehusk’s coconut milk), and any add-ons (sugar syrup, espresso shot, whey isolate, and cold foam in vanilla, chocolate, or salted caramel). For the full list of syrups and sauces, you can request it from the baristas. And if you can’t decide, they’ll be happy to recommend something based on your mood or preference. The custom Iced Spanish Latte is well-made — the rock salt and cheese foam hits you with a thick, sweet-and-salty cloud of cream, best blended with a straw or a spoon so it doesn’t overpower the coffee’s overall chemistry. With this powerful blend of strong and sweet, the burnt vanilla syrup often comes through subtly, though the espresso tastes sharp throughout. As for this custom Iced Matcha Latte, the combination of honey syrup and rock salt, and cheese foam is sweet and milky enough to please any sweet tooth, but can be adjusted for those who prefer a bolder matcha flavor with a more distinct oat milk taste. A collaboration between Dot Coffee and The Kind Cookie, this new Cookie Affogato is half-matcha and half-chocolate chip cookie, paired with vanilla ice cream and a strong shot of espresso. The texture is crisp on the outside and smooth on the inside, but the refreshing difference is the espresso, which trickles down and softens the chunky cookie with an energizing caffeine kick. As of now, the Cookie Affogato remains exclusive to order at this branch. Another new selection has been released across all stores — the Hojicha Line introduces the Hojicha Oat Latte, the Black Sesame Hojicha Latte, the Caramelized Banana Hojicha Latte, and the Strawberry Hojicha Latte. As Lao mentioned, Dot Coffee’s brand has constantly evolved since it began. The café first offered a simple lineup — lattes, Spanish lattes, white chocolate mochas, and their signature mocha — but soon expanded as customer preferences shifted. Since then, Dot Coffee has been brewing new items, such as their protein line for health-conscious customers, and a collaboration with Happi Lab for kombucha and tea offerings. According to Lao, these additions reflect their goal of “catering to different lifestyles and customer needs.” A post shared by Dot Coffee (@drink.dotcoffee) As she explained, the choice of their new location reflects Dot Coffee’s next step in becoming a space where people can truly connect and unwind. “Aside from Salcedo being an office area, it’s also like a neighborhood. So, it’s really now a space to hang out in rather than just grab-and-go,” Lao shared. With that in mind, she hinted that good, affordable food, like rice meals and pasta, will soon be added to the menu. Dot Coffee may have started as a delivery-only brand, but its biggest branch proves it’s ready to take things offline. From a “cloud kitchen” to a third space, Dot Coffee aims not just to curate experiences where customers feel at ease, but where they feel known — where every cup ordered comes with convenience and community, and being on the “dot” can also mean taking your time. You can also catch Dot Coffee in W City Center and W Global Center in BGC, Greenhills Mall in San Juan, Podium in Mandaluyong, Landmark TriNoma in Quezon City, The Mind Museum in Taguig, Robinsons Galleria along Ortigas Avenue, and SM City Santa Rosa in Laguna. — Jaella Magno/Rappler.com Jaella Magno is a Rappler intern studying AB Literature major in Creative Writing at De La Salle University.",True,true,When a homegrown coffee concept shifts from grab-and-go to sip-and-stay,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/dot-coffee-branch-makati-city-sip-stay-cafe/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The 1Sambayan coalition urges Finance Secretary Frederick Go and the National Treasury to return P107.23 billion in “excess funds” to the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC). The PDIC remitted these funds to the Treasury in January 2025 as part of a special provision tied to unprogrammed appropriations under the 2024 General Appropriations Act. This special provision was also used to authorize the transfer of P60 billion in “excess funds” from state health insurer PhilHealth. (READ: Supreme Court orders return of P60B to PhilHealth, bars further fund transfer) The state deposit insurer said the funds were intended for several government projects such as the Metro Manila Subway and the Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situations (AICS), a social aid program criticized for perpetuating political patronage. 1Sambayan pointed out that the Supreme Court already ruled that transfers made under the special provision as unconstitutional. “By this ruling, Special Provision 1(d) and DOF Circular No. 003-2024 were stripped of any legal force. They cannot serve as authority to transfer the funds of any government-owned or controlled corporation to the National Treasury,” the coalition said. Retired Supreme Court associate justice Antonio Carpio, who is also the lead convener of 1Sambayan, earlier said some of the funds remitted by the PDIC were diverted to the construction of flood control projects. Because of the transfer, the PDIC’s assets as of end-2024 dipped to P278 billion from P339.6 billion in 2023. “The drop in net assets is primarily attributed to remittances to the Bureau of the Treasury aggregating P107.2 billion fund balance under the GAA and P10.7 billion dividends, P1.2 billion operating expenses and P300 million payment of insured deposits,” the agency wrote in its 2024 annual report. Despite the transfer, PDIC’s president and chief executive officer Roberto Tan earlier assured depositors that its Deposit Insurance Fund is still enough to cover shocks in the banking system. As the state’s deposit insurer, the PDIC guarantees clients they can receive up to P1 million per depositor per bank in the event of a bank closure. – Rappler.com",True,true,"1Sambayan urges DOF, Treasury to return P107B to PDIC",https://www.rappler.com/business/1sambayan-urges-department-finance-national-treasury-return-pdic-funds/,Rappler
"Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer: How should I approach my family? I’m the youngest (23) and only son in my family. I’m confused on where to seek advice. My older sisters aren’t the easiest to get along with. I’ve experienced aggressive tones, verbal abuse, and harassment akin to a nasty drill sergeant. So yeah, I do feel small like a maggot or dirt for them to use as a punching bag with no repercussions all because “they’re right, I’m wrong and I screwed up” or maybe “I don’t fit or drift away from their standards they want control over me”? Yet I’m left to be the “bigger man” and look at the “values” beyond the hurtful words. No chance for me to express how wronged I feel and would resort to bottling up the anger at the treatment I tolerate. My emotions would be invalidated while nobody would draw the line when their emotions would fuel their lips. I’d be called “too sensitive” or “over-reacting.” I know it’s not healthy to suppress my emotions but I know my emotions are there to tell me that I’m not being treated fairly. Would I be better off distancing myself from these people, just enough time until their hearts grow fonder? Maybe I should master the art of not giving a fuck? Or maybe they should? How can I cope with this? Do I just accept this is the norm? I’m only as good as I am useful? The norm for men to live without anyone checking up on them, hardly receiving compliments, without feeling appreciated let alone being acknowledged? Thank you in advance, Royce Dear Royce, In many parts of the world, order of birth determines the family hierarchy. The eldest sibling is automatically invested with authority over their younger siblings, regardless of merit, and this is a lifelong tradition. You have the misfortune to be the youngest in your family, and thus, you are expected to kowtow to your elders — not just your parents but also your sisters. This is not necessarily a problem when everyone shares the same values, but it is clear that you have values and standards which do not align with those that the rest of your family expects of you. Your family does not appear to be very accepting of any departure from the norms that they embrace, hence the discord and tension between you. So how should you proceed from this point? If you are resolved to change your relationship with your siblings in a significant way, it might be sensible first to give them a clear message by having a conversation with them in which you explain that you have had enough of their abuse and aggression, hope that it will stop but warn them that if it doesn’t, you will take all necessary steps to protect yourself from their toxic behavior towards you. You may feel that this is too confrontational or that they are simply not open to reasoning. After all, you will be making a stand against what has been the family dynamic for so many years. In this case you should slowly but surely start establishing some distance between yourself and your sisters so that you are protected from them. How easy or difficult this will be depends on your personal circumstances but the aim is twofold: to reduce/eliminate their influence on your life and to show them the consequences if they do not change their attitude towards you. You are after all entitled to lead your own life in accordance with your own values and not simply be a puppet whose strings are pulled by your family. All the best, JAFBaer Dear Royce, Thank you very much for your letter. All your questions are extremely important and valid. The one that stands out most is a two-parter: “Would I be better off distancing myself from these people?” Yes. “Just enough time until their hearts grow fonder?” No, because they won’t. Their hearts won’t grow fonder because, in my mind, your sisters are already fond of you, and probably using this fondness and love as an excuse for their behavior. They could also be unaware of how much their behavior upsets you. Yes, you have probably shown them time and again that their actions upset you, that they are being unfair and unkind, but it doesn’t seem to have sunk in. That is the reason I agree with Mr. Baer that you “give them a clear message… explain that you have had enough of their abuse and aggression… warn them that if it doesn’t, you will take all necessary steps to protect yourself from their toxic behavior towards you.” However, I do not agree that you establish some distance slowly. In my opinion — admittedly based on no research to back me up — you might already have done something different with the clear and no-nonsense message you will have given them, mainly because you have never said how you feel in such clear and uncertain terms. You have told or hinted to them that you are being suffocated, but to no avail. Once you have done something different with this clear message, not as a younger brother or a supplicant but as an adult like them, they might notice you have a backbone after all. But, again in my opinion, that will not be enough to change them. Go the whole hog and reinforce this message by actually doing what you’ve said you will do should they become aggressive once more. Why such emphasis on the above? Because of one of the basic tenets of family therapy. A family is a system that runs on homeostasis. It has been running on this system of “tyrants-who-must-be-obeyed, you-who-must-obey” for so long. They will not stop unless they have to. Tyrants never willingly give up their advantage. Painful as it sounds (because it seems like, despite your anger, you also love your sisters), you have to wrest your power from them, no matter how reluctant they are to give it up. All you ask is fairness, reciprocity: that they behave towards you respectfully, the way you behave towards them. Thus, the very next time they do this, you do something different. You do not merely tell them and then things go back to normal after things “get back to normal.” You remain consistent with what you said you would do. You are right, Royce, it will be extremely difficult to change what has already been a norm in your family — especially because it is a norm in society: “The norm for men to live without anyone checking up on them, hardly receiving compliments, without feeling appreciated let alone being acknowledged?” You cannot change your sisters until you change yourself. It will be difficult because it will mean behaving in a way you never have, and sticking to this behavior of non-engagement with them until they realize that this will not be the usual “tantrum,” which is probably how they see your displeasure, that will go away when you’ve become tired. No, this time your displeasure will remain until they change. If it will only change if you distance yourself from them, then so be it. This distance need not be physical, as that might be impossible at the moment. But it can certainly be emotional. And who knows, dearest Royce? You might even be doing them a favor. In fact, if they live up to their names as sisters, they might even welcome the opportunity to learn new ways to deal with you. Might, however, is the operative word. But if that does not happen, then grit your teeth and remember that: “You can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.” But oh what a delicious omelet that you can eat freely and happily, without hearing their verbal abuse over breakfast.

"MANILA, Philippines – Potluck parties and Christmas get-togethers are in full swing, and if you’re choosing to stay in instead of braving the December traffic, you’re not alone. Meals at home, shared with friends and loved ones, can feel just as special — sometimes even more so — when the food is thoughtfully chosen and meant for sharing. From restaurant party trays to festive cakes, desserts, and easy pulutan, homegrown restaurants, chains, small businesses, and home-based bakers across Metro Manila are putting together holiday-ready offerings you can order ahead and serve at home.

Everything tastes freshly cooked and fit to be served at one of Moment Group’s restaurants. The holiday promo runs until January 15. For a more polished potluck spread, Bizu’s party sets are recommended. The 10-Hour Roast Beef is a highlight, slow-cooked until tender and served with Parmesan mashed potatoes and gravy. It’s paired with Bizu’s Baked Seafood Au Gratin, Spinach and Mushroom Ravioli with Pomodoro and Feta, and Rosemary and Lemon Chicken. Additional options include Kurobuta Rib Roast and Herb Roast Salmon Beurre Blanc, and other restaurant-level side dishes. On the dessert side, there’s a new Quezo De Bola Loaf Cake and Bizu’s Macaron Noël Tree, which can act as a beautiful holiday centerpiece. It includes Bizu’s new special queso de bola with dulce de leche macaron flavor! Orders can be placed via Bizu’s website. A home-based, family-run business serving authentic Filipino-Chinese food, China Mommy’s holiday ham has become a seasonal staple made from a generational recipe. This year’s cured pork shoulder comes in a customized box and is available for pick-up on certain days. Each whole ham weighs approximately 900 grams to 1 kilo and is slow-cooked until tender, then glazed with the brand’s signature pineapple sauce (served on the side). The flavor leans savory-sweet with a slight tang, making it easy to pair with bread, pan de sal, white rice, or to be enjoyed on its own. Orders can be placed through China Mommy’s online store.

Leonisa’s Kitchen specializes in home-baked desserts that are delicate and pretty to the eye. The sugar-free Passionfruit Milk Chocolate Pavlova (P2,650) balances chocolate richness with citrus brightness and a light meringue crunch, without tasting sugar-free. Also, a good dessert option that’s fluffy, light, and creamy is the Mixed Fruit Shortcake, with layers of vanilla chiffon, soft cream, and fresh strawberries, mangoes, and muscat grapes. Leonisa’s fruitcake takes a more indulgent route: buttery and moist, packed with fruits and nuts, and soaked in rum and brandy. Orders are taken via Instagram. Sainte Anne’s tiramisu cups are designed for easy eating: espresso-soaked sponge layered with airy mascarpone, coffee liqueur, and a dusting of dark cocoa, all served in individual cups with tiny spoons. The mascarpone texture is light and cloud-like, with a pleasant bitterness from the cocoa that keeps the dessert from becoming too sweet. The cake itself is moist enough and bold in its coffee flavor. They are available for pre-order, with branches in New Manila and Alabang. For something a little unique and more adult-friendly, the Dark Heart Imperial Stout is a limited-release collaboration between Engkanto Brewery and Auro Chocolate. Brewed with Regalo and Mana cacao nibs from Auro’s award-winning cacao beans, the stout leans into notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and subtle sweetness.

"MANILA, Philippines – As the year closes, several fine names have quietly taken root — new, some not-so-new but still flying under the radar. Helmed by notable chefs and skilled kitchen teams, each restaurant carries a clear point of view, anchored by personality, voice, and a sincere vision behind it. These are places that know who they are, what they want to cook, and why. Whether it’s a fine dining date night in BGC or Marikina, a destination meal outside Metro Manila, or French comfort food in BGC for late-night catch-ups, these tables are worth a reservation this holiday season and into the year ahead. Along a quiet sidewalk in Sto. Niño, Marikina City, Leo Sea House is easy to miss. Once a sari-sari store, the space has been transformed into a humble, seafood-forward fine dining restaurant that feels intentionally small; homey, warm, and quietly confident. With a chef’s table that seats three to four guests and a small upstairs dining area that fits about three couples, the intimacy of the space reflects the intention of Chef Francis Lacson’s cooking. The 10-seater restaurant recently launched Buon Appetito!, a tasting menu inspired by neo-Italian cuisine, highlighting fresh seafood from Capiz and the rest of Panay Island. While Lacson is also known as the head chef of Francesco’s in San Juan, known for its cozy Italian comfort food, Leo Sea House is a more innovative but still personal divergence. “Leo Sea House was inspired by our desire to pay tribute to the fine produce from our hometown,” shared the owner. “We wanted to share the meals we grew up eating: greens, seafood like pinaisan na isda, rice, and fruits, around the dining table,” Lacson said. For its price point at P2,500+ per head, this stands as one of the more affordable yet satisfyingly filling tasting menus around. It’s upscale without feeling stiff, refined without losing warmth. There’s a sense of community here; each course is prepared freshly in front of guests, like watching a home kitchen at its busiest. The meal (and palate) opens with bruschetta topped with fermented oysters and parmesan; briny and balanced by the sweetness of the oyster and the sharpness of the cheese. The Seafood Squash Zuppa Velouté, a comforting bowl of delicately sweet buttery squash. The quality of the seafood stands out — tender, sweet, and never overcooked. The rotola, a handmade pasta with seafood bolognese, tastes like a slow-cooked, meaty ragù made from a grandmother’s recipe; a surprise to remember that there is no ground meat in there. A granita of wine-poached pear, lemon, and cardamom provides a refreshing pause before the next course: squid pasta ravioli with smoked ricotta and sofritto, and the osso buco-style dish, served with white fish risotto and gremolata, is another hearty yet pescatarian-friendly main. A former seafarer and hostage survivor, Lacson came to cooking later in life, teaching himself through cookbooks and global travel. At Leo Sea House, every course feels like an application of those life lessons — thoughtfully composed and utilizing a wide range of seafood without straying from the homey Italian flavors Lacson loves. It’s filling without being overindulgent and showy, and worth its price, even for the wine pairing available at P4,000+. One of the newest additions to BGC’s dining scene, Liyab marks Chef Charles Montañez’s boldest and most personal project yet, following the success of Mamacita. Here, he returns to his favorite element: fire. From the phoenix-shaped utensil holders to the casual but confident presence of the kitchen team behind the open kitchen, everything feels thematically cohesive and sure of itself. There are no barriers between chef and guest. Even when dishes and menu are set aflame tableside, it never feels excessively performative — a reflection of Montañez’s quirky, bold, but deeply rooted and humble cooking. “Liyab is the kind of fire that wakes you up from the inside,” Montañez shared. “It starts quietly, then grows into purpose, commitment, and renewal.” Montañez’s menu blends his Latin American influences with Filipino soul, lifted by local produce, many of them native, rare, and hardly spotlighted. Each course feels like part of a larger narrative, theatrical but never at the expense of flavor and heart. The first course — Bone Broth, Ox Tongue, 15-month Beef Garum, Corn Custard, and Bone Marrow Butter — arrives as a nostalgic homage to the bulalo. A custard made from local corn sits beneath aged beef garum and fried leeks. Tableside, a heated flambadou melts bone marrow butter into clear bone broth, which is poured over the dish. A calmer, Japanese-inspired progression follows with Botan Ebi served alongside hot prawn tea. The shrimp is paired with miso ice cream and Malagos blue cheese. Beneath it, radish blanched in dalandan ponzu is topped with dalandan kosho and seasonal lanzones. The cold blue cheese sings the loudest, and the delicate warm broth tempers it — a deliberate contrast of temperatures, tastes, and textures. The BBQ, Squid Ball & Tawilis course is nostalgic and playful; an elevated take on Filipino street food, followed by a palate cleanser inspired by Filipino holidays: Sampaloc, Nata de Piña, and Christmas Ham — bright tamarind acidity and familiar sugary bites, balanced by savory notes. The salu-salo main course is the standout, and brings everything together in a hearty, familiar fashion: confit-style pork adobo cooked in a pugon using vinegar alone; beef longganisa made from three cuts of beef and grilled over wood fire; aged market fish grilled in banana leaf; heirloom rice from Negros; and sides of balao-balao, atsara, and santol sa gata. From the side dishes to the mains, there are no misses here; just empty plates. Desserts lean nostalgic, too — including a childhood-inspired, multitextural, Ice Scramble-inspired icy treat using fresh strawberries, Pop Rocks, marshmallows, toasted milk ice cream, and brownies. Liyab is fine dining that doesn’t intimidate; Montañez cultivates an atmosphere that is chill yet composed. The beautiful, minimalist space is suited for couples or a group of friends who want to share a culturally exciting experience rooted in identity and passion. Little Miss Saldo’s is an à la carte, family-style restaurant derived from the original Saldo’s tasting menu private dining experience on the same Tagaytay property. However, Little Miss Saldo’s is proud of its own identity — different, but not disjointed. It offers an array of global cuisines, yet everything feels like it’s served in someone’s home. That, in many ways, perfectly sums up chef Rhea Rizzo. Everything feels well-arranged, from the space to the food. And for the longest time, Rizzo says she had well-meaning friends asking her, “Rhea, what’s your food? Define it.” After all, nobody wakes up craving “global comfort food.” People usually crave Japanese, Italian, French, or whatnot. “For the past four years, I kept pushing back on defining it. But then I realized — because of my experiences: being classically French-trained, living in Bangkok, Ubud, and the US on and off for two years, particularly in Napa Valley — that’s what makes me different. So why not embrace it?” she told Rappler. “I finally said, ‘Can’t I just be good?’ There is an underlying theme here. It’s comforting,” she added. And it’s true: Eating at Little Miss Saldo’s is like eating at the home of a family member who just cooks really well. Even the name carries weight. “Our last name means wild,” Rhea shared. “I realize now I’ve been hiding behind the name because I didn’t want my own name attached. I’m trying to change that…embracing visibility is a struggle, especially for female chefs.” Her main influences are French, New American, and Southeast Asian. New American, she explains, is shaped by places like Napa and San Francisco — melting pots where food reflects migration, coastal influences, barbecue, seafood, and constant evolution. The space follows suit. Inspired by Napa, Sonoma, and the Hudson Valley, it feels artisanal, classy, yet unpretentious, with muted colors and beautiful dried flower arrangements. More than just a new concept, Little Miss Saldo’s marks a creative shift for Rhea — a chance to explore a wider range of ideas and embrace a more spontaneous, uninhibited approach to cooking. “It’s a format that’s like contemporary dance,” she said. “Free from the rigidity of classical ballet. Not as square or boxed in, but still as beautiful in its freeform.” The meal opens with a portobello and porcini mushroom velouté, served in teacups — sophisticated in both presentation and taste. It delivers the depth of real mushrooms, with a chewy texture that grounds it, making it feel both refined and comforting. From there, the menu moves from French to Japanese influences: a teriyaki-based ox tongue on a stick, paired with a refreshing wakame salad. It leans Japanese but carries a distinctly Filipino flavor — savory, bold, slightly sweet, and sticky. Next comes a delicate pan-fried barramundi, with crisp skin and flaky, tender flesh, finished in beurre noisette that’s buttery and silky, lifted by a slight acidity from lemon and accentuated by crispy capers. Then the flavors shift again, this time toward Asia, with a massaman curry and lamb ribs dish. Rizzo’s delineation between cuisines is abrupt but never jarring; each dish has its own personality and satisfaction. Dessert brings the meal home: a sticky date pudding that’s moist on the inside, with burnt caramelized notes at the end of each bite; a dark chocolate tart with a crisp shell and a decadent, gooey center; and a honey butter toast made with her expertly baked homemade brioche (her sourdough is a must-try). Together, they all encapsulate Rizzo’s philosophy — experiment, go a little crazy, divert, and don’t chain yourself to one thing. At Little Miss Saldo’s, Rhea gives herself — and her guests — free rein to follow whatever the heart and stomach call for, always ending on a satisfying note. It’s a drive worth taking from Metro Manila, especially during the holidays, for dates, family outings, or long, leisurely meals. The lush, verdant property allows you to linger for an hour or two after eating, whether that’s a walk around the foliage or a quiet coffee at the bakery downstairs. After its Poblacion outpost, Dr. Wine opened a second branch in BGC, and it’s not just about the wine. French cuisine is served here in generous, hearty portions, led by executive chef Marc Silvestre from Spain. In the kitchen, he moves coolly and calmly at the pass, plating with precision and restraint, his cooking guided by a deep respect for ingredients. Originally from L’Escala in Spain’s Costa Brava, Silvestre trained in renowned kitchens such as El Celler de Can Roca and Meadowood in Napa Valley. His cooking blends classic French technique with Spanish influences, anchored in seasonal ingredients and personal memory. Dr. Wine started in Shanghai with a simple idea: good food and wine should be easy to enjoy and best shared. When it opened in Manila in 2017, that philosophy translated into relaxed, welcoming spaces and a menu rooted in French bistro classics. The BGC branch can get loud and packed at night, but that’s part of its unpretentious French bistro charm. It never feels empty — always buzzing, upbeat — yet grounded by the straightforward dishes. The buttery and delicate Confit Cod with Zucchini pairs slow-cooked zucchini velouté — confident in its vegetable flavor — with leeks, crispy garlic, and smoked pimentón d’Espelette. The Pan-seared Foie Gras and Hokkaido Scallops, served with porcini, smoked cauliflower purée, and a 24-month Comté sauce, is indulgent without feeling heavy. The Comté brings a deep, unctuous richness, while the foie gras and scallops come together in a silky, tender balance. Lighter dishes shine too, like the Amberjack Hamachi Crudo, fermented in a cold tomato consommé with fresh lime and cucumber sun-dried tomato oil. The brightness of the consommé lifts the freshness of the fish, made even more addictive by chili pepper drops that add a punch of spicy sweetness to each bite. It works well as a palate cleanser before moving on to richer plates, such as the Rigatoni Carbonara, finished with spicy cured Italian ’nduja, chili peppers, egg yolk cream, and Parmigiano Reggiano. Ambiance aside, Dr. Wine BGC suits holiday occasions that are looser and more casual — friends, relatives visiting from abroad, or nights that lean toward the lounge-bar scene but still call for food beyond bar chow. It’s French cuisine that feels authentic, approachable, and reasonably priced for what it delivers. Another destination meal comes from Anya Resort, although this one is best enjoyed with an overnight stay. But if you’re just visiting Tagaytay City, it’s not always about dinner. Weekend brunches can be just as fitting for the holidays. At Samira by Chele Gonzalez in Anya Resort Tagaytay, led by executive chef Christopher Leaning, weekends take on a slower, gentler pace. Served from 11 am to 2 pm every Saturday and Sunday, the new brunch encourages leisurely dining. Curated by Chef Chele Gonzalez, the menu covers the essentials without feeling excessive: freshly baked breads, a selection of charcuterie and cheeses, and egg dishes that range from hand-cut bacon eggs Benedict to a spicier Asian crab omelette. It’s got the makings of a savory brunch — the charcoal grill platter of tiger prawns, churrasco, and Anya’s Cumberland sausage is enough to fill up for lunch, completed by desserts like pineapple pavlova, banana waffles, or torija stretch. “What makes our weekend brunch at Samira special is its sense of comfort and sharing,” said Leaning. “Chef Chele’s menu reflects a balance of creativity and familiarity, dishes that encourage guests to slow down and connect.” Brunch is served on the second floor of the restaurant, overlooking the pool and the resort’s green, foliage-filled grounds, with Tagaytay’s cool breeze adding to the relaxed experience. At P2,500 per person, it almost feels like a proper lunch. The bread and bakery basket have mini ciabatta, sourdough rolls, croissants with honey mustard butter, and homemade seasonal fruit jam. The charcuterie and cheese platter includes house-made mortadella, pastrami, lemon ricotta, and manchego. By the end, it’s more than enough for the price, covering everything you want from a hearty brunch (or an early lunch): quality carbs, protein from eggs, cheese, and deli meats, something sweet to finish, and, of course, coffee, or a leisurely cocktail served tableside. There aren’t many Thai restaurants in Boracay, and The Lind clearly saw the gap. Located inside the beachfront resort in Station 1, Yìm brings focused, flavor-forward Thai cooking to the island. Yìm — meaning “smile” in Thai — presents a relaxed yet assured space, with modern, sophisticated interiors that never feel intimidating. The restaurant is built around sharing, with dishes designed for the center of the table and Asian-inspired cocktails that temper the heat and spice. The menu is shaped by Siriporn “Chef Joy” Krasae-at, who was born and trained in Thailand. Drawing from both everyday Thai home cooking and professional kitchen experience, she brings an authentic, grounded approach to the food. The menu stays true to how Thai dishes are meant to be cooked and enjoyed, while thoughtfully adapting them to local ingredients. The 70-seater restaurant offers green curry with coconut milk, eggplant, sweet basil, and chili; rich, fragrant, and comforting. The grilled marinated Australian lamb cutlets with nam jim jiew, star anise, and cinnamon are tender and soft, with just enough spice and warmth. The tom yum — available with prawn or chicken — is slightly sweet, aromatic, and fragrant, with a steady hum of spice from lemongrass, galangal, and chili, and the comforting tang of lime. The food carries an authentic heat that feels distinctly Thai, but never overpowering. Its homey Thai flavors are presented with refinement. It’s a worthy stop if you’re staying in Station 1 or nearby. Yìm is open for lunch and dinner from 11 am to 10 pm. – Rappler.com",True,true,Where chefs take the lead: Tables to experience this holiday season (and beyond),https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/chef-driven-restaurants-manila-tagaytay-2025-beyond/,Rappler

"MANILA, Philippines – Even without saying a word, pets already speak a language we all understand — the kind that tells us we’re not alone. Whether it’s spotting a stray on the street or cuddling with a pet at home, a cat’s gentle purr or a dog’s wagging tail has a way of making our world feel lighter. Before the rise of the automatic feeders or the talking buttons, cats and dogs first bonded with humans out of survival — wolves lingered near camps, cats stayed close to farms — and soon, they became part of our families. They supported our survival back then, and they’re still helping us heal now. Studies show that spending time with pets increases oxytocin levels, promoting feelings of trust, empathy, and relaxation, and reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. In return, we also provide love, support, and care to our furry friends. Around Metro Manila and nearby areas, there are many groups that rescue strays, find them loving homes, and welcome anyone willing to help. Here are a few shelters you might want to visit or support. Founded in 2018 by Malou Perez, Pawssion Project Foundation is a nonprofit organization that has rescued more than 2,000 animals, rehomed over 600 dogs and cats, and housed 600 rescues in its Bacolod and Bulacan shelters. Their shelters are open to visitors from Tuesdays to Sundays (10 am to 5 pm). Based on the website, the shelter asks volunteers to help clean the shelter, walk the dogs, feed them, and even do content creation to raise awareness, among other tasks. If you can’t visit the shelters, your care can still go a long way by being a Pawssion Project supporter. And for those ready to adopt, there’s a P1,000 adoption fee that covers a portion of the animal’s spay/neuter, vaccination, and care. The name might fool you — this shelter doesn’t just take in cats but dogs and barn animals, too. The Cat House, founded by Arizza Dungca, has rescued over 300 animals, providing them with food and medical care. With no official funding, the shelter is run by a small family who transformed a farm warehouse into a sanctuary. According to an interview with Dungca, they have hundreds of cats and dozens of dogs, along with pigs, goats, a horse, a carabao, a turtle, and even ducks. If you’d like to help, you can find details on how to send in-kind or monetary donations here. PETA’s Ampon Alaga breaks the cycle of overpopulated and abandoned pets by advocating for free spay/neuter services, rescuing strays, and finding them loving homes. Adoption here is free, and they deliver your new companion if you’re based in Metro Manila, Rizal, Bulacan, Pampanga, Bataan, Laguna, Cavite, or Batangas. But if you’re not yet ready for the commitment adoption entails, you may consider fostering, where you can offer space at home for a cat or a dog for just three months. You can also walk their rescued dogs around Poblacion and Rockwell, Makati, from Mondays to Fridays and Sundays (8 am to 11:30 am) and Saturdays (7 am to 11:30 am). For available slots, just send them a message on Instagram. If you currently have a pet that still hasn’t been spayed or neutered, they have a list of vet clinics offering low-cost services. Stray Love PH was founded by Geraldine Therese Lim, giving strays, no matter how beaten or forgotten, a chance to heal. Now, in Tanay, Rizal, they’ve built a home for more than 200 dogs — many of them once nothing but skin and bones, but now learning to feel safe again. The shelter welcomes visitors who’d like to see their progress or volunteer to help care for them. To visit or sponsor a dog’s medication, just send them a message on Instagram. You can also see here how you can send in-kind or cash donations. Founded in 2015 by Maxin Arcebal and Chelsea Pecson, Hound Haven Philippines, Inc. focuses on retired working dogs from the military and private security. It’s the first rehabilitation center in the country for service dogs, located in Bulacan. In the Philippines, there’s still no standard system for retiring or adopting service dogs, and this is something Hound Haven continues to advocate for. Until then, this small team remains the only institutionalized group fighting for the proper care and transition of these working heroes. Their shelter is also now open for visitors. You can help out by fostering, adopting, or donating as every peso helps give back to the dogs who’ve spent their lives in service. Since 1954, PAWS (Philippine Animal Welfare Society) has been giving animals another chance at life. Their Quezon City shelter is now home to more than 300 dogs and cats rescued from neglect and abuse. They’re also known for their low-cost spay and neuter services, TNVR drives, and Fetch & Fix program, where they provide free sterilization for their pets of homeless people. Through Project C.A.L.M. (Comforting Animals through Literacy Movement), volunteers can also visit the shelter not just to see the rescues but to read stories to shy or scared animals, which can help them relax and feel a little less alone. PAWS also does more than rescue. Their Dr. Dog program also brings therapy dogs to hospitals and schools, healing people as much as animals. Their Volunteer Applications will open on January 1, 2026, where you can choose to care for the animals directly or take on behind-the-scenes work. You can also open your home to a rescue after an interview and a shelter visit. Adopting comes with a small fee — P500 for cats and P1,000 for dogs — which goes straight to feeding and caring for the rescues still waiting for homes. And if you can’t adopt, you can always donate to support their work. – Rappler.com Jaella Magno is a Rappler intern studying AB Literature major in Creative Writing at De La Salle University.",True,true,"How pets help us heal — and where you can help them, too",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/pet-shelters-metro-manila-mental-health/,Rappler
"The economy is ending 2025 on an upswing driven again by holiday spending and strong Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) remittances but definitely with a slower-than-expected growth rate below the government’s target of 5.5% to 6.5%. S&P Global set it at 4.8% on the basis of the temporary reduction in public infrastructure spending, while private local economic institutions like UA&P and the World Bank are placing it at 5.1% and 5.3%, respectively. The general outlook for 2026 is more optimistic albeit cautious. Public spending is expected to accelerate while inflation is expected to stay low during the year and global conditions stabilize. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is seen to accelerate to around 6.2%. While estimates are still mixed with some analysts even predicting further weakness, the Philippine peso may maintain its parity with the US dollar in the high 50s but just below 60 following an expected rebound in government spending that could boost investor confidence and buttressed by the continuing heavy inflow of OFW remittances. Again, growth in 2026 is expected to be primarily driven by strong domestic consumption, bolstered by low inflation estimated at around 3% for 2026, rising employment, and strong remittance inflows from OFWs. This will result in volume of growth in the sector dealing in food, retail, and consumer staples. The financials, especially banking, are next. Continued economic expansion will fuel sustained credit demand from both corporate and consumer segments. Moreover, stable monetary policy and favorable interest rate conditions are expected to allow major banks to sustain strong earnings growth. Expected to also do well is infrastructure and construction. The government has committed to maintain high infrastructure spending, targeting 5% to 6% of GDP over the medium term. This sector is projected to register a significant annual growth rate, estimated at over 7% all the way through 2029 as big-ticket public-private partnership (PPP) projects, including railways, ports, and bridges, move forward. Then come the Real Estate Investment Trusts or REITs. The REIT sector benefits from stable cash flows generated by properties used for infrastructure and logistics. They will continue to provide attractive dividend yields to investors. Considering that there is a serious domestic shift in government policy toward sustainable and critical energy sources – in keeping with the global trend – the energy and renewable resources sector is also poised to become key investment growth areas for the year and onwards. The sector will be heavily supported by local investment facilitation boards. This will encourage companies focused on solar, wind, and geothermal power to expand rapidly to both meet the rising clean energy demand and need to transition away from fossil fuels. Mining and extraction may find traction at this time, too. Continued global demand for critical minerals and industrial metals is expected to increase and keep the mining and extraction sector robust, especially with government reforms aimed at boosting the industry. Finally, the services sector is also estimated to play a key role in catering to long-term global trends at the same time remain as the largest component of the economy, accounting for about 61.5% of GDP. Together with the entry of Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure, the Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing (IT-BPO) sector is expected to sustain growth, adapting to global demand trends, including those related to electronics and semiconductors. Global demand for AI-related electronic products is expected to boost merchandise trade, directly benefiting the Philippines’ substantial electronics assembly and export industry. First MetroSec’s head analyst Mark Angeles and assistant colleague Estella Dhel Villamiel, who were responsible for the production of the recommendations, premised their stockbrokerage house’s strategy and game plan referencing Robert Frost’s 1915 poem “The Road Not Taken.” Angeles and Villamiel see the market standing in some crossroads and is set to take what it calls as the familiar muddle-through path that is lined with caution spilling over into the next 12 months. For 2026, the index target range is placed between 5,500 to 7,500, with a base case of 6,500, driven by an earnings per share (EPS) growth of +5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) rather than by valuation expansion. Risk premium is assumed to remain elevated at 600bps, near +2SD above the technical historical mean of the market considering the lingering confidence concerns, in general. If the above explanation was confusing than enlightening, just remember that First MetroSec is estimating that the market may hit the high of 7,500 of the market’s main index (which is the Philippine Stock Exchange index or PSEi) or fall as low to 5,500 in 2026 but is confident to see it thread at 6,500 on the basis of an EPS growth estimate of +5% CAGR rather than by market valuation performance. What is important, according to Angeles, “much of the valuation damage is already priced in, which should limit downside risk.” Factors that could steer the market upwards include governance reforms and normalization of public spending, macro stability with GDP growth returning to trend, and renewed foreign fund inflows. Source: First Metro Securities, Refinitiv Closing price as of 27 November 2025 In summary, Angeles and Villamiel of First MetroSec reiterate their barbell strategy, wherein “One foot remains on the familiar road with dividend plays and defensives for cashflow/earnings visibility, while the other steps onto the road less travelled with large-cap cyclicals positioned for economic and confidence recovery.” Also, they advocate “an unmarked trail with AI diffusion as an emerging structural theme, favoring sectors with high operating leverage.” – Rappler.com (The article has been prepared for general circulation for the reading public and must not be construed as an offer, or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or financial instruments whether referred to herein or otherwise.

"MANILA, Philippines – The holidays are just around the corner, and for many Filipinos, this means heading home to reunite with family, catching up with old friends, or taking that much-needed solo escape. But while we crave the thrill of the journey, nothing kills the mood faster than ticket-hunting stress, long queues, or sketchy online bookings – making planning more exhausting than the trip itself. Unsecured online pages, inconsistent schedules, and scarce platforms for advance ticketing turn even a short trip into an ordeal, especially for those traveling between cities or provinces. Mirra Reyes, co-founder and CEO of Biyaheroes, knows the commuter struggle firsthand. “I’m also a commuter, so Biyaheroes is a development made by commuters for commuters,” she said. Created in 2015, the platform helps users book bus, ferry, and boat trips online, serving routes across major destinations in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Traveling across the Philippines often feels like stitching together a patchwork of islands with sheer will power. That dream trip to Bicol or a quiet escape to Coron can easily turn into a logistical maze — jumping between multiple booking sites, or attempting a walk-in commute that often leaves you wandering terminal floors, unsure where you’re supposed to board. This is the problem Biyaheroes solves by acting as a one-stop hub for domestic transport. Instead of juggling schedules and scanning scattered timetables, travelers simply enter their origin, destination, and date in the website. The platform gathers routes from its network of land and sea partners — from major bus liners to fast ferries — and lays out a clear, seamless connection. The experience feels less like a booking chore and more like being gently guided through a journey. Once you find a schedule that fits your day, the site hands control back to you. You can choose your own seat, and the ease carries through to payment as well. Credit cards work, but the platform also recognizes that many travel plans happen between errands or late at night. So it offers familiar options, from paying at a 7-Eleven to settling the fare through your usual banking app. Beyond the booking flow, there’s a quiet safety net. Biyaheroes has been smoothing out island-to-island trips for over a decade, and that experience shows. As Reyes explained, their support team functions almost like a personal travel coordinator. “We handle the cancellations and rebookings of our passengers, and our dedicated customer support team is here to answer any concerns. We are in direct coordination with our transport partners, and should any unforeseen changes occur with our passengers’ trips, we inform them immediately and present them with their possible options,” Reyes said. For many Filipino commuters, booking a trip can make them feel as if they’re stuck in the past. Some bus companies only sell tickets in person while others offer online booking but remove access to senior, PWD, or student discounts. Many platforms are also so complicated that anyone not tech-savvy struggle to navigate the process. “Movie seats and restaurant reservations could already be booked online. We couldn’t understand why something as vital as public transportation didn’t have a platform to make things easier for everyone,” said Reyes. Biyaheroes lets commuters check schedules and choose their seats, which are guaranteed even on ferry routes or operators that follow free seating. It also allows commuters to apply student, senior, and PWDs discounts during booking, verified through an ID check when they board. Philippine tourism peaked in 2018, with over 7 million international arrivals. Though the pandemic brought the industry to a near standstill — dropping to just around 1.5 million visitors in 2020 — this year has shown signs of recovery, with the Department of Tourism (DOT) recording 2.9 million international arrivals in the first half of 2025. Tourism plays an important role in the Philippine economy. In 2024, it accounted for about 8.9% of GDP. A Klook survey also found that 98.5% of Filipinos plan to travel within the country in 2025. But with the cost of living rising, discussions are ongoing this year about fare hikes. While there are ongoing and future initiatives aimed at promoting environmental sustainability and boosting the tourism economy, there is still much to improve in the country’s transportation system. Online booking platforms that aim to assist commuters represent a step toward making the Philippines accessible for its own people, giving more Filipinos the chance to explore their own country. – Rappler.com",True,true,How this platform for and by commuters strives to make travel easier in PH,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/biyaheroes-strives-make-travel-easier-filipinos/,Rappler
"In a banking system built on confidence, deposit insurance is the keel that keeps the ship upright when seas turn rough. In the Philippines, that keel is the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC). And yet, in 2024, the government chose to plane down that keel — remitting over ₱117 billion from PDIC to the Bureau of the Treasury — just months before doubling deposit coverage in March 2025. I don’t see that as an act of prudence, but of self-inflicted fragility. Start with the hard facts. PDIC’s total assets fell by about 18% in 2024, dropping to roughly ₱278 billion after the state took ₱107.2 billion (under the GAA or General Appropriations Act) plus ₱10.7 billion in dividends. I did not dream up these statistics; they’re in PDIC’s 2024 reporting as covered by the press on October 15, 2025. Now, consider the exposure side of the ledger. Effective March 15, 2025, the maximum deposit insurance coverage (MDIC) doubled from ₱500,000 to ₱1,000,000 per depositor per bank. Regulators and banks framed it as a confidence booster for small savers — and it is — but it also doubles PDIC’s potential liability. Even industry and government advisories emphasize that shift. What happens when you expand the umbrella while slicing the fabric? In 2024, PDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF)-to-insured deposits ratio was reported around the high-single digits. With the higher MDIC and a growing deposit base, the projected cushion slimmed further into 2025. That is exactly the wrong direction if your goal is to keep depositors calm when a small or mid-sized bank falters. Defenders of the remittance will say, “It’s lawful.” Indeed, the GAA permitted it. But lawful is not synonymous with wise — especially when dealing with a fiduciary fund. PDIC is not a profit-seeking government-owned or -controlled corporation (GOCC) designed to remit surplus earnings; it’s a statutory safety net funded primarily by insurance premiums from banks and investment income precisely to be there when failures occur. That’s how well-run deposit insurers work across the world: the fund is built from assessments on the industry, not harvested for fiscal cosmetics. If you want a clear benchmark, look at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the United States. Its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) is funded “mainly through quarterly assessments on insured banks,” not by taxpayers, and it operates according to a Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR) policy that targets a long-run fund size (the FDIC Board has adopted a 2.0% DRR in recent years). The FDIC’s framework is explicit: grow the fund through assessments until the target reserve ratio is reached and adjust rates to stay on track. It is not designed to remit its reserves to the Treasury to beautify budget arithmetic. Equally important — especially after the 2023 US regional bank turmoil — the FDIC reiterated that deposit insurance is not taxpayer-funded in normal times; losses are covered by the industry via assessments, and when shocks drain the fund, the FDIC levies special assessments on banks to rebuild it. That’s how a safety net maintains credibility without raiding its own reserves for unrelated fiscal needs. Some will counter: PDIC’s income rose in 2024, and the fund still looks “adequate.” But that argument confuses flow with stock. Income is an annual flow — helpful, yes — but the stock of liquid, ready-to-deploy claims-paying resources is what matters in a crisis. When you siphon ₱117 billion from the insurer in a single year, you shrink the available shock absorber. That the system didn’t break last week is not evidence that the policy was sound; it is evidence that we’ve been lucky. And if you want to see a neighbor that takes fund sufficiency seriously, look at Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia (PIDM). PIDM publishes balances for its Conventional and Islamic Deposit Insurance Funds, and it operates under a Target Fund framework — a policy tool that explicitly sizes the fund against modeled loss scenarios and gives it authority to raise assessments or borrow to maintain adequate coverage. In 2024, PIDM reported a combined DIF balance of about RM 4.915 billion, alongside additional protection funds for insurance/takaful — proof that even in a smaller system, the architecture is oriented toward building buffers, not extracting them. Even if one were to argue that the PDIC had “excess” buffers — it didn’t! — timing would still kill the case. The government pulled the largest chunk in 2024, and then in March 2025, when MDIC doubled to ₱1 million, fully insuring over 147 million accounts (roughly 98.6% of total accounts). If you are going to increase coverage, you build the fund first. You do not enlarge the promise and then thin the wallet. That invites the very loss of confidence deposit insurance is designed to prevent. “But our banks are fine.” Until they’re not. The purpose of a deposit insurance fund is not to predict each failure; it is to be credible when failures occur. Rural and thrift banks — often the backbone of local credit — are the first to feel deposit flight. When headlines mention PDIC’s assets falling and its remittances rising, the whisper in the countryside becomes: “Can they still pay?” That whisper is how liquidity runs begin. And here’s the uncomfortable truth: once a run starts, you don’t stop it with mere talking points. You stop it with unambiguous capacity to pay claims fast. That capacity rests on the fund you’ve kept and the authority you wield to rebuild it, not on how much you remitted last year to dress up the national budget. United States (FDIC). The FDIC’s board sets a DRR each year — currently targeted at 2.0% long-run — and manages assessment rates to reach and maintain it. After the 2023 failures (Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank), the FDIC adopted a special assessment to restore the DIF, with the industry paying the bill over several quarters — no fiscal raids, no budget theatrics. The FDIC’s fund is invested in nonmarketable Treasury securities, can access borrowing lines in emergencies, and — crucially — its finances are off-budget, funded by the industry rather than appropriations. Malaysia (PIDM). PIDM’s 2024 Annual Report details fund balances and a Target Fund methodology. Where the protection fund proves insufficient, PIDM has clear legal authority to raise premiums, borrow from government, or issue debt to bridge gaps — codified tools to preserve confidence. That is institutional muscle memory focused on fund adequacy, not fiscal remittance. They are certainly not academic differences, but are design choices that separate stable systems from fragile ones when the cycle turns. PDIC’s resources exist to protect depositors — not to plug fiscal holes. When the Treasury extracts ₱117 billion in a year, it sends two corrosive signals: Contrast that with the messaging from FDIC and PIDM: assessments flow into the fund to meet insurance objectives, targets define how much is enough, and special tools kick in to rebuild when shocks hit. That is forward-looking stewardship. Fiscal managers love the optics of remittances, which they read as “discipline.” But the outcome is a thinner PDIC at a time of higher obligations. It is easy to celebrate a one-off boost to non-tax revenues. It is harder to explain why, when a rural bank fails next year, payouts take longer, confidence wobbles more, and the contagion risk widens. The truth is simple: a peso remitted is a peso not available to pay insured claims. Worse, the decision can force second-order costs: higher risk-based insurance premiums later (to replenish the fund), tighter bank margins, and more cautious lending — an indirect tax on the economy that dwarfs the photo-op of last year’s remittance. There are three immediate reforms that would realign policy with the public interest: Let’s run a simple pre-mortem. Imagine a mid-sized thrift bank buckling under credit losses. Depositors line up. Social media amplifies doubts: “Didn’t PDIC’s assets drop last year? Didn’t they remit ₱117B?” The rumor outruns the rebuttal. Two more banks wobble. Suddenly, the cost of the previous year’s “discipline” overwhelms the optics: you discover that the cheapest crisis is the one you prevented by funding the umbrella properly. History’s lesson is brutal: deposit insurance failures are rarely about law, and always about confidence. You don’t inspire confidence by hollowing the lifeboat. Congress should protect PDIC’s fund the way central banks protect their balance sheets: as critical infrastructure. The executive should treat PDIC as a systemic safeguard, not a dividend machine. And PDIC should make it impossible — politically and technically — for anyone to raid the fund again without a public fight. We can still fix this. The MDIC has already risen to ₱1 million as of March 15, 2025; that policy only succeeds if the fund behind it is ironclad. Do what the best systems do: set a target, levy the industry, and keep every cent in the pot for the day it’s needed. Because the next time waves hit, depositors won’t be measuring your press releases. They’ll be measuring the depth of the fund — and how fast it pays. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] How the treasury drained PDIC’s shield – right when we needed it strongest,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-how-treasury-drained-philippine-deposit-insurance-corporation/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Every year, on the last week of October, many Filipinos travel far to honor and pay respect to their departed loved ones during Undas. Over the years, this yearly ritual has evolved alongside changing travel habits — blending remembrance with recreation, as Filipinos find ways to honor the past while enjoying a well-deserved break. A survey conducted by MOVE, AirAsia’s online travel agent, revealed where Filipinos are headed this Undas. Unsurprisingly, the top picks remain local destinations — from provinces and beach spots to bustling cities in the metro. According to the survey, more than 80% of air travelers are flying to different parts of the country, with Manila, Caticlan (gateway to Boracay), Cebu, Iloilo, and Tacloban as the most popular destinations. Manila’s inclusion is largely attributed to the Manila North Cemetery — one of the largest cemeteries in Metro Manila where over 100,000 departed are buried. Around 2 million visitors are expected there from October 30 to November 1 (All Saints’ Day). The other areas on the list are considered “major hubs” that connect travelers to nearby cities and municipalities. For instance, Iloilo City serves as a gateway to Guimaras Island, while Tacloban City in Leyte links visitors to Biringan City in Samar. Interestingly, the same destinations also make up the top points of origin, with Caticlan in Aklan, as an exception, replaced by Bacolod on the list. Anticipating a surge in flights, most travelers came prepared, securing their bookings at least two weeks ahead of Undas, while others finalized their plans as early as a month before. Though this travel habit has long been ingrained in Filipino culture, it still speaks volumes about the importance placed on tradition. Nearly half of the respondents (49%) planned a three- to four-day break, suggesting that most local travelers aim to make the most of the long weekend, likely by reconnecting with family in their hometowns and squeezing in a bit of leisure or local exploration. Most travelers secured their bookings two to four weeks in advance, with nearly 34% finalizing their plans 15 to 30 days before departure. The busiest travel day was October 30 — a day ahead of the official long weekend. While most travelers booked domestic flights, some took advantage of the long weekend to finally check off international destinations from their bucket lists. A total of 19% of respondents are going abroad. Those who booked flights from October 30 to November 2 are headed to travel spots around Asia, including Taipei, Tokyo, Osaka, Kuala Lumpur, and Seoul. The surge in local flights this Undas is proof that Filipinos’ custom of remembering and respecting the dead remains, to this day, alive and thriving.– Deanne Imperial/Rappler.com Deanne Reese Imperial is a Rappler intern studying journalism at the University of Santo Tomas.",True,true,Where are Filipinos headed on Undas weekend?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/filipinos-travel-behavior-move-air-asia-survey-undas-2025/,Rappler
"Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer: I think I became part of a threesome last weekend, I am not sure, but it feels that way because of the after-reactions from other people. My boyfriend Harry, 27, took me to a party where he “warned” me some people would be more liberated than me. I was not scared because he reassured me he would protect me. Like he always has in the past, when I am in situations I am unfamiliar with. My bf suggested a threesome when we met eight months ago but I said no. Sex, for me, is sacred and involves two people who must be in love. He laughed, said my innocence was what attracted him to me, not my age (I am 18). He brings up threesomes since then, but never insisted we do it. He even takes me to parties where these things happen later. We go home before midnight because that’s when things start to happen. This is how well he takes care of me. Last month, we went to the usual party but it was also different. First, we didn’t leave at midnight, I told him I wanted to go, but he insisted on staying. He was hurt when I didn’t trust that he would take care of me. Things got heated up, I again asked to leave and this time he was angry. I got scared. He told me to loosen up and said a drink would help me. I told him I already reached my limit of two drinks, but he just laughed. There is nothing that proves I had a threesome, but Harry changed. He still calls but is not as loving. What can I do to bring him back? He is my first and only boyfriend. I do not want to lose him. Ana Dear Ana, Thank you for your message. Your question is how to get your boyfriend Harry to be his former loving self. For a number of reasons, however, this seems to be a misguided aim. Your account raises several red flags. Chief among these are: Given your age (18) and lack of life experience (first and only boyfriend), one has to wonder whether Harry intended from the very beginning to manipulate and control you. Certainly he achieved this, since against your will you remained at this party, seemed to have gotten drunk and have little, if any, recollection of what subsequently happened. The very fact that you suspect he got you to take part in a threesome against your expressed wishes surely should persuade you that he did not have your best interests at heart. In these circumstances I would very strongly recommend that you end the relationship immediately. You deserve a boyfriend who is actually willing to give you the respect, trust and protection that a well-founded relationship demands. All the best, JAF Baer Dear Ana, Thank you very much for your letter. I can understand how hurt you are because Harry, your first and (so far) only love, has changed. I also get how you wish things were as they were before, when Harry made you feel protected and cared for. But is all this show of protecting you real? Example: your limit is two drinks. And yet, not only did he not respect this, but by actually suggesting you have a drink “to relax” and then merely laughing when you explained you’d reached your limit, he was actually: first, encouraging you to go past the limit you set; second and far more insidiously, he’s teaching you the wrong thing about alcohol. Yes, alcohol can “relax” you, but it does this by impairing your inhibitory control. One possible effect of impaired inhibition is doing things you ordinarily wouldn’t — like engaging in a threesome. Trouble is, as you said, you don’t really know if you did because you don’t remember anything more after that third drink. Yes, Harry is protective… until he isn’t. Remember how he always made sure you left parties before midnight and yet at this last one, not only did he not make sure you left the party before midnight, he actually made sure you didn’t. You believed him when he said he was “hurt” when you wanted to leave by midnight, but then he quickly became angry when you asked to leave the party shortly afterwards. Usually, a person turns from being hurt to being angry when he feels he was wronged. Frankly, I see nothing in your behavior that could lead to his feeling wronged… unless, of course, he was worried that if you left at the usual time, the usual things (threesomes, etc) would again not happen. A client once told me about the CF (cringe formula): Divide the older partner’s age by 2; add 7 to the resulting quotient. This resulting sum is the cringe limit. If the younger partner’s age is equal to or more than the sum, then your relationship is not cringey. At least, not when it comes to age. HOWEVER, if the younger person’s age is less than the sum, then yes, the relationship is “cringe.” Probably in that the older person can more easily fool, manipulate, and pull the wool over the eyes of his partner. Thus, using this formula, Harry’s girlfriend would have to be at least 20 years old or else he would be thought of as a DOM. There is no scientific basis for this formula so, if your relationship were based on this formula alone, Harry’s being “cringe” when dating you is neither here nor there…AND YET.. I cannot help feeling he’s a bit cringey when he doesn’t fulfill things he promises (like taking care of you), when he uses anger instead of his usual charm, and when he tries to chip away at your resolve to avoid certain behaviors. My dearest Ana, I am sorry that I have not done what you asked: suggest ways you can bring him back to you. I hope, however, that will not stop you from thinking about some of the things Mr. Baer and I have written here?

"MANILA, Philippines – The earnings of the Philippines’ leading online gaming provider DigiPlus Interactive Corporation (DigiPlus) took a hit in the third quarter of 2025 due to tighter regulations imposed by the government on the digital gaming sector. Tycoon Eusebio Tanco’s DigiPlus’ net income fell 59%, from P3.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024 to P1.7 billion for the same period this year, and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) declined by 47%, from P3.8 billion to P2 billion. “Revenues, meanwhile, contracted 23 percent to P10.05 billion on impact of tighter regulation, which required e-wallet providers to delink in-app access to licensed online gaming platforms,” DigiPlus said in a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Thursday, November 6. These e-wallet providers were mainly GCash and Maya. “This temporarily disrupted player actvity and transaction volumes across the industry during the period,” it said. DigiPlus currently dominates the Philippine online gaming sector with a market share of around 40% in the first half of 2025. It has over 40 million registered users across its digital ecosystem. These include its bingo platform BingoPlus and sports betting brand ArenaPlus. DigiPlus also has traditional perya or e-carnival games, plus online tongits, a popular local card game. DigiPlus attributes its success to its pivot in 2022 from its brick-and-mortar gaming business to digital. The latter now accounts for 90% of the company’s revenues. DigiPlus’ competitors include Playtime, OKBet, CasinoPlus, Bet88, among others. Other regulations the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) imposed on the gaming industry are: In response to the tighter government rules, DigiPlus said it partnered with CIS Bayad Center Incorporated (Bayad) to expand over-the-counter payment options nationwide for its various platforms. With the partnership signed by Tanco and Bayad chairman Ray Espinosa last month, DigiPlus users (BingoPlus, ArenaPlus, GameZone) can now top up their e-wallets via Bayad Centers and select Bayad partners nationwide. Bayad is the biggest multi-channel payment platform in the country’s outsourced payment collection industry. BingoPlus players can also cash in in their BingoPlus accounts for free via select Pay&Go kiosks nationwide. “Following its delinking from third-party payment platforms such as GCash and Maya, DigiPlus aims to strengthen its proprietary ecosystem to ensure operational independence, enhance system reliability, and support sustainable growth,” the company said. DigiPlus said it also partnered with Philippine First Insurance Co. Inc. for the country’s first surety bond program for online gaming players. The surety bond protects player balances of up to ₱1 million per player, without requiring customers to purchase a separate policy, it said. Despite the drop in its third quarter earnings, DigiPlus remained profitable for the first 9 months of 2025, with consolidated net income of P10 billion, 16% higher for the same period in 2024. Revenues went up from P51.56 billion to P66.8 billion, an increase of 30%, DigiPlus said, due to “increased business activity and the rollout of new games and licenses approved by Pagcor.” For the first three quarters of 2025, DigiPlus said it paid P25 billion in government taxes and fees, a 9% hike from the P23 billion in the same period in 2024. In the third quarter of 2025, however, DigiPlus paid P7.17 billion in taxes and fees, a decrease of 26% “due to the impact of the e-wallet delinking directive.” Tanco said its earnings for the third quarter “demonstrate(s) DigiPlus’ resilience amid temporary setbacks.” “Throughout this period, we continue to focus on digital innovation, player protection, and good governance,” he said. – Rappler.com",True,true,Earnings of Tanco’s DigiPlus take a hit with tighter gaming regulations,https://www.rappler.com/business/digiplus-interactive-earnings-report-q3-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Need an adrenaline rush? Go-karting might be your new best friend. It’s much simpler than driving a car, so much so that even kids flock to the tracks, circling the perimeter until their parents say it’s time to go. But don’t be fooled; it’s an activity fit for anyone of all ages looking to race to their heart’s content. In these go-karting tracks located around the Philippines, you can safely satisfy your need for speed — no license required! Drift Motor Speedway opened its doors to the public in July 2022. Set inside the Valley Fair Town Center in Taytay, Rizal, the track welcomes both the young and the young at heart as long as you have a hunger for speed. For kids who want to take a shot at reliving their favorite racing games, they can convince their parents to enroll for the DMS Academy, an in-house go-karting program that teaches the ins and outs of racing within the safety of the facility. The academy offers three kinds of sessions: beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels which ensures that the fundamentals of racing are instilled in the kids’ regime. Drift Motor Speedway is open daily from 12 pm to 9 pm. From Mondays to Thursdays, friends and family can enjoy a 15-minute ride around the track in a Junior Kart for P730 and in a Pro Kart for P950. During Fridays and weekends, it’s priced at P850 and P1,100, respectively. Situated along McArthur Highway, Kart City Tarlac (KCT) opened in 2013 with accessibility for family and friends in mind as it stands right across SM City Tarlac. Priced at P250 per drive, the open area track is open for those looking for a drive in the north without breaking a sweat for it. Not only does KCT offer a go-karting track, it’s also a home to other entertainment and recreation sites. Guests can enjoy bowling, billiards, and karaoke with their friends while waiting for their turns on the track. During the holidays, they bring out bands for live performances during their open mic nights at Chaps Diner, a restaurant whose menu resembles that of the old time 1950s and 1960s American diners. The diner also serves a variety of Filipino food as well as cuisines from other Asian countries. Right next to the track itself is Trackside Grill, an open pub area where one can have some drinks and chat while watching their friends compete against each other on the track. Set at 500 meters with 15 corners running counterclockwise, MADKART is located in the Tambac District in Dagupan City. Opened in June 2022, the go-karts come from OTL Electrokart, an Italian electric go-kart manufacturing company. Children and adults alike can enjoy 10-minute races around the circuit for P600 and P700 in the junior and adult karts, respectively. The company also offers a promo package for both karts, priced at P1,500 and P1,800 for three sessions. MADKART is open Tuesdays to Sundays from 1 pm to 10 pm. City Kart Racing holds on its own in Pampanga, overseeing what is currently known as the Pampanga International Circuit. It opened on Bonifacio Day 2019, holding three days’ worth of racing events like the Rotax Philippines Invitational and 12-Hour Sodi World Series Endurance to celebrate its opening. According to Time Attack Manila, the circuit was designed to allow “five different layouts with the longest configuration stretching to 1.400 km start-to-finish.” It currently stands at 1.400 kilometers and takes more than a minute to complete a lap, at a maximum speed of 85 kph. City Kart Racing is also the same operator behind Circuit Makati, which unfortunately closed in March 2020 to make way for Ayala Circuit Makati’s further developments with the mall. The track is open on Tuesdays to Thursdays from 12 pm to 5 pm, and on Fridays to Sundays from 10 am to 5 pm. Adrenaline junkies looking to conquer the five-year old track would be bound to pay for a 12-minute race ranging from P600 to P900 on the short track, and from P1,000 to P1,200 on the longer track. – Juliana Chloe Gonzales/Rappler.com Juliana Chloe Gonzales is a Rappler intern studying AB Communication Arts at De La Salle University.",True,true,No license needed!

"SHANGHAI, China – China’s Pop Mart is borrowing from Disney’s playbook to turn toothy monster Labubu’s blockbuster sales into long-term success, Executive Director and co-COO Si De told Reuters in a rare interview. Pop Mart has already done what many thought impossible – making Labubu the first Chinese product to win a global audience for its emotional and creative appeal, rather than because it represents value-for-money. Now it aims to capitalize on the art toy’s success. “We have learned from Disney for a long time. In fact, Disney’s great value lies in its ability to operate IP (intellectual property) over the long-term, even up to 100 years,” Si said, pointing to the example of Mickey Mouse, created as a cartoon nearly a century ago. Even as analysts question Pop Mart’s reliance on Labubu and the company’s fate as the toy’s popularity inevitably cools, the firm itself still sees plenty of potential to develop content, entertainment, theme parks and more merchandise around the character – as Disney does with its most popular IP. Si did not give a timeline or estimate on investment during the first interview a top executive from the firm has done with foreign media since 2022. He said Pop Mart’s focus in the near-term was not to find the “next big hit” but to invest in “better products, finding better collaborations, developing content, theme parks, store displays” for Labubu, and the eventual goal was to have five to 10 IPs with similar long-term potential to Labubu. Labubu’s global success has sent the Hong Kong-listed company’s shares up almost 200% so far this year, and Pop Mart is now worth more than Hasbro, Mattel and Sanrio combined. “Pop Mart is selling a lifestyle that consumers are buying because they want to be part of it,” said Louis Houdart, China managing partner at Mad, a consulting firm, adding that its margins rivalled some luxury brands. It has also fueled investment in China’s red-hot art toy industry, intensifying the competitive pressure on Pop Mart, the market leader. Estimates in July from Industry World, a Chinese market intelligence platform, said the Chinese art toy market was expected to reach more than 120 billion yuan ($16.85 billion) in revenue this year, accounting for more than 35% of the global market and maintaining double-digit growth in China. Though Pop Mart does not break out Labubu sales, the series it belongs to, The Monsters, accounted for almost 35% of total first-half revenue this year, raising questions about the company’s dependence on the character. Labubu’s popularity has boosted sales of stablemates such as Molly, Skullpanda and Crybaby (which each had more than 1 billion yuan in sales in the first half), but also fueled curiosity beyond Pop Mart’s offerings. “Because of the success of Pop Mart, there are more people with money wanting to invest in this industry. You see right now there’s a lot of new companies and there’s definitely more and more artists trying to do IP as a way of making money,” said Runyu, the 24-year-old winner of China’s first art toy design competition reality TV show. Other major art toy retailers in China include 52 Toys and Miniso, which traditionally relied on licensing IP from the likes of Disney and Sanrio, but is now investing more in original IP development and signing partnerships with art toy designers. “Pop Mart has blazed a trail” for the rest of China’s art toy industry, said Zhou Junyu, head of IP at Siguworks, one of the art toy companies working with Miniso. As Pop Mart has studied Disney, other firms in China have studied Pop Mart. Whether the Disney model will help it see off the growing competition remains unclear. “We all know Disney’s playbook, which overall is relatively easy to replicate, but its success is not,” said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang. “I mean, compared to the legacy IP operators like Disney and Sanrio, Pop Mart still has a long way to go and during the process, there is also execution risk.” Pop Mart’s success with Labubu did not happen overnight, and was largely due to strategic decisions taken by founder and CEO Wang Ning over the past decade, three current and former Pop Mart employees said. They declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media. In 2010, Wang, only 23 but with a string of entrepreneurial ventures behind him, opened a hip lifestyle store in Beijing. Within a few years he saw collectible figurines accounting for a significant portion of revenue, and decided to focus on art toys. Wang also realised Pop Mart needed to own the IP it sold, according to two former employees, leading him to Kenny Wong – the designer of Molly, with her distinctive pouty face. Hong Kong-based Wong was dismissive when Wang first approached him in 2016, but he eventually agreed to a trial collaboration. “During my most difficult years, inventory was my biggest concern, then Wang Ning showed up. He first solved my inventory problem, selling out all of it in a short period of time,” Wong told Reuters. Wong handed regional licensing for Molly over to Pop Mart and the success continued. Labubu made its Pop Mart debut in 2019. “Each time, they achieved remarkable results and progress, so much so that I finally gave them everything I had,” Wong said. Pop Mart’s “blind box” retail strategy – where consumers buy packages for around $10 to $20 without knowing exactly which toy is inside – and its focus on characters with appeal to young women, a high-spending consumer group that had previously been largely overlooked by the art toy industry, were the twin foundations of its success, the Pop Mart insiders told Reuters. “I wouldn’t say they have the model 100% right, that every IP is going to be a hit, but I think with the experience they have, they will get it right more than most,” one said.

"MANILA, Philippines – Japan isn’t just known for its A5 wagyu — there’s much more to meat from the Land of the Rising Sun. Considered a culinary rarity, Matsusaka beef is one of the most coveted cuts in Japan. It comes from Japanese Black cattle reared under strict, traditional conditions in the Matsusaka region of Mie Prefecture. Production is limited; only around 7,000 cows are slaughtered for Matsusaka beef every year, which contributes to its exclusivity and premium pricing. The key is maintaining an ideal, stress-free, and controlled environment for raising Matsusaka cattle. According to Japanese farmers, this helps “placate the spirits of the cattle,” producing healthier, higher-quality beef, prized for its high fat-to-meat ratio (BMS), tenderness, rich flavor profile, and exquisite marbling. Because of these, Matsusaka is often referred to as the “Queen of Wagyu.” It has a very low melting point — around 12°C — which allows its fat to dissolve quickly and easily, resulting in a cuts-like-butter consistency. Within Japan, Matsusaka forms part of the Sandai Wagyū, the “three major Wagyu” alongside Kobe and Ōmi (or Yonezawa) beef. Only a handful of farms produce the rare beef, and Ito Ranch is considered one of the first-tier farms in Japan. The family-owned ranch established in 1953 in Mie Prefecture maintains an impressive 90% A5-grade ratio among the cattle it supplies. For perspective, the Japan Meat Grading Association cites that only about 12% of all genuine Japanese Black (Wagyu) cattle achieve an A5 grade. Although it has the capacity to breed 1,400 cattle, the ranch intentionally limits its herd to 700 to maintain its strict standards. With over 70 years of experience, the ranch remains one of Japan’s most trusted and awarded Matsusaka producers. Because Matsusaka beef is rarely exported, its recent arrival in the Philippines is celebrated by the country’s F&B industry. Prime Cuts by Doubleday, a local importer of luxury meats from Japan, has partnered with Ito Ranch to bring limited quantities to the Philippine market. The strategic partnership is strongly supported by Hiroki Ito himself, the third-generation head of Ito Ranch in Mie Prefecture. “This isn’t just about introducing our beef to a new market. It’s about sharing the care, patience, and generations of tradition that go into every step of raising our cattle,” he said. Customers — from chefs to home cooks to business owners — can purchase cuts directly from the Prime Cuts by Doubleday website, with nationwide shipping available. Because of the rarity of the meats, premium prices are to be expected for the four kinds of Matsusuka beef cuts available for purchase. There’s the Tenderloin (P22,990/kg), cut from the least-worked muscle. The A5 tenderloin is extremely fine-textured and delicate, delivering clean, pure beef flavor ideal for refined dining. The Striploin (P17,990/kg) has a balance of lean beef and delicate intramuscular fat for a firm yet tender classic steak experience, while the Top Sirloin (P11,990/kg) has a robust beef flavor complemented by fine streaks of fat, typically used in premium Japanese cuisine. The Short Plate (P5,990/kg) is the most accessible cut, which still has Matsusaka’s signature marbling and richness. The beef is currently available via different dishes in Prime Cuts’ partner restaurants like Teppanya and Sicilian Roast, with more establishments to be announced soon. Matsusaka beef is prepared as purely as possible, with minimal seasonings, flavorings, and extra ingredients. Many restaurants use the beef for sukiyaki, yakiniku, or shabu-shabu, while chefs and home cooks like to enjoy it at its prime — just salted and then seared over very high heat for a short time for a tender, buttery, and luxurious steak experience. – Rappler.com",True,true,"What is Japan’s Matsusaka beef, and why is it so rare?",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/japan-rare-matsusaka-beef-ito-ranch-doubleday-import/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – “Sabi nga nila (As they say), the most personal cooking is the most unique. For me, my concepts are very personal. You can’t copy personalized dishes. Because there’s only one you.” Talking to Rappler, Chef Jorge Mendez shared what he believes makes his restaurant concepts rarely without snaking lines and fully booked reservations. He is, after all, one to watch: He is the brains and brawn behind the Michelin-selected Modan, Mugen, Makanai, and Bib Gourmand–awarded Some Thai, which opened its second branch at Podium Mall in Ortigas in December. On the heels of his Michelin Guide recognition, Mendez said, “It’s been very busy, but I’m happy.” And setting his sights on Podium Mall had been a long time coming. “My family and I go to Podium often,” he shared. To him, everything he does must be, and always is, connected to his heart – his family. The new space can seat up to 54 guests, with an open layout that includes a 10-seat private dining room and 44 seats in the main dining area. It was intentionally designed for both intimate dinners and large group meals. Some Thai’s dishes are meant for sharing, Mendez said. Mendez said his dishes are inspired by his personal travels and the different restaurants abroad that he had gone to over the years. These have influenced the Podium branch’s exclusive dishes, like the Steamed Sea Bass and a new take on Tom Yum, but noodle-style. The sea bass is gently steamed until flaky, moist, and tender, then served swimming in a slightly tangy, aromatic clear broth of lemongrass, cilantro, garlic, ginger, red chili, and lime. Mendez said the flavors remind him of a “Thai-style paksiw” — clean and fragrant, with a bright yet gentle acidity to complement the buttery, fresh fish. “As Filipinos, we want homey food,” Mendez said. “But when we put too many things, it becomes too much, or too spicy — not really homemade.” He shared that he’s tempered spice levels over time based on customer feedback. Compared to Thais, many Filipinos aren’t as comfortable with intense heat. For the fish, he kept things simple in concept yet distinct in flavor, with nothing too overwhelming; basically, Mendez’s philosophy for Some Thai. Light and sophisticated, it works as a refreshing centerpiece amid Some Thai’s saucy and spicy dishes. Another Podium exclusive is the Gai Tod, Some Thai’s take on Thai fried chicken. Crisp and conveniently cut into strips, it’s topped with fried shallots, garlic chips, and cilantro, and served with a homemade sauce similar to sweet chili: savory, slightly spicy, and with a hint of sweetness. The chicken happens to be Mendez’s personal favorite. “I love Gai Tod,” he said, referring to Thailand’s beloved street-style fried chicken. “I was always curious how they do it. So we got the flavors from a local Gai Tod, but the batter is Manila street food–style.” This is also another core part of Mendez’s culinary philosophy: staying true, but not strict. Some Thai’s tagline — “inauthentically authentic” — is an idea Mendez stands by, rooted in the belief that good cooking can be playful and fun, but at its core, should always be good. The Son-in-Law Egg, a crowd favorite, isn’t traditionally served this way in Thailand. It’s Mendez’s own take on an omelette: a deep-fried mountain of egg with a dramatic presentation, dressed in a bold soy-lime vinaigrette that’s savory, tangy, and just slightly sweet. Fresh vegetables surround it, with a whole egg sitting right at the center. Mendez shared that certain dishes carry a “5-10% injected Filipino touch.” The Crab Curry features fresh crabmeat chunks bathed in a crab fat-forward sauce, which must be mopped up with either the sweet pineapple fried rice or the more savory seafood fried rice. The desserts are what remind Mendez of home. The Mango Sticky Rice leans biko-like in texture, Mendez pointed out, and Podium’s exclusive Khanom Kho (pandan coconut dumplings) is reminiscent of bilo-bilo. Chewy, bouncy pandan coconut-filled dumplings swim in a sweet and creamy coconut sauce, with pandan oil and nutty-sweet panutsa. Mendez’s spin on the quintessential tom yum was memorable — instead of soup, he transforms it into tom yum noodles made with glass noodles, similar to Korea’s japchae. The result is a slippery, smooth noodle experience, with a thick tom yum sauce that clings to every strand; each forkful carries the soup’s signature sour, fragrant, and slightly spicy charm. And for the actual Tom Yum Soup, “I wanted it to be like a bisque,” Mendez said. Thick, rich, and far from the usual clear broth. The soup is a premium presentation on its own: crab legs, prawns, mussels, and squid nearly spilling out of a ceramic pot, finished with fresh cilantro, vegetables, and meant for sharing among four people. Mendez’s ability to move seamlessly between cuisines — Japanese for Makanai and Mugen, Thai for Some Thai — comes from years of extensive R&D experience, which trained him to adjust, divert, and experiment without losing the soul of a dish. “Normally, if I want to open something, I first connect with the brand,” he told Rappler. “Parang role sa pelikula ‘yan (It’s like a role in a movie). You have to own it, know what the role is, and then connect with the character. Ganoon din sa (It’s the same with the) brand.” And for Mendez, it’s never just about himself. Every concept is for someone else — his customers, yes, but most importantly, his loved ones. “If it’s not my family’s favorite, I won’t do it,” he said. And because his cooking comes from the heart, it’s easy to connect with every dish he puts out. – Rappler.com",True,true,"For Chef Jorge Mendez of Some Thai, cooking is always personal",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/chef-jorge-mendez-some-thai-podium-pasig-personal-cooking/,Rappler
"The Philippines sits at the center of a moral paradox in the global climate debate. Producing barely less than 1% of global emissions, the country is among those most exposed to climate risks, yet least capable of influencing the planet’s temperature trajectory. Demanding rapid net-zero sacrifices from a developing economy may satisfy global optics, but it does little to alter climate outcomes, while imposing real costs on households, businesses, and competitiveness. True climate justice, in this context, is not measured by symbolic targets, but by whether energy policy protects development, keeps electricity affordable, and avoids turning power into a privilege for the few. The more durable path forward is disciplined pragmatism. The Philippines must pursue renewables aggressively, without destabilizing the grid or pricing growth out of reach. An all-of-the-above energy strategy that preserves reliable baseload power, while scaling clean technologies, is not ideological compromise; it is economic necessity. Development itself is the country’s strongest climate defense, enabling resilience, adaptation, and long-term decarbonization. The choice is not between climate responsibility and growth. For the Philippines, the only climate strategy that endures is one that keeps the lights on, the bills manageable, and the economy moving forward. Every typhoon season brings the same moral refrain: the Philippines must accelerate toward net zero to protect itself from climate catastrophe. It is a noble instinct. It is also, on its own, a misleading one. Net zero is an attempt to balance the amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) released into the atmosphere and the amount removed. The uncomfortable arithmetic is unavoidable. The Philippines accounts for roughly 0.46% of GHG emissions. Even if the country miraculously achieved net zero overnight, the trajectory of global warming would remain largely unchanged, driven by the far larger carbon footprints of industrial economies. Climate change would not pause. Storms would not politely weaken at our borders. The planet would continue warming because global problems do not respond to unilateral sacrifice by marginal emitters. This reality does not absolve the Philippines of responsibility, but it does demand honesty. Climate change is a collective-action problem, and pretending otherwise risks turning moral urgency into economic self-harm. When a developing country bears heavy costs for outcomes it cannot meaningfully influence, the result is not climate justice but a misplaced virtue. That distinction matters because the costs are not abstract. They arrive monthly, printed on electricity bills, absorbed by households whose pockets are already stretched thin. They appear in factory margins, in food prices, and in the quiet erosion of competitiveness that determines whether jobs are created or lost. An energy transition that prices power beyond the reach of ordinary Filipinos is not just politically fragile — it is socially regressive. This is where the conversation must shift from symbolism to substance. I get it that climate justice for the Philippines begins not with emissions targets, but with development. History offers no counterexample: no country has lifted millions out of poverty without abundant, reliable, and affordable energy. Electricity is not a luxury add-on to growth; it is its precondition. Clinics cannot refrigerate vaccines on intermittent power. Schools cannot teach effectively through rolling brownouts. Manufacturing cannot scale on unstable grids. For a country still climbing the development ladder, asking the poorest households to shoulder higher power costs in the name of global emissions reduction — when their contribution to the problem is negligible — is a moral misallocation. Justice, in this context, means refusing to make electricity a privilege only of the affluent. That moral boundary leads naturally to a harder, more pragmatic conclusion: energy policy must be judged by outcomes, not intentions. The Philippines needs renewables. Solar, wind, and other clean technologies are essential to long-term sustainability, diversification, and resilience. But they are not yet substitutes for dispatchable baseload power. Their variability is a technical constraint, not an ideological one. Until storage becomes cheap and scalable, the grid requires firm capacity — from coal, gas, and other conventional sources — to remain stable and affordable. An energy strategy that treats this reality as heresy rather than physics is not progressive; it is reckless. Brownouts are not climate solutions. Neither are power rates that render local manufacturing uncompetitive and quietly export jobs to countries with cheaper electricity and dirtier grids. This is why the most defensible transition strategy is not technological purity, but technology agnosticism. An all-of-the-above energy mix is not a betrayal of climate goals: it is the only way to sequence the transition without breaking the economy in the process. The objective is not to delay renewables, but to integrate them without destabilizing the system they depend on. Affordability, therefore, must be the true north. Not because carbon does not matter, but because costs do. Electricity prices ripple through the economy, shaping inflation, investment decisions, and employment. When power becomes expensive, everything else follows. A climate policy that ignores this reality will not survive voter scrutiny, investor discipline, or basic arithmetic. The irony is that development itself is one of the most effective forms of climate adaptation. Wealthier societies build stronger infrastructure, enforce better standards, and recover faster from disasters. They invest in resilience because they can afford to. A poorer Philippines, constrained by high energy costs and stalled growth, is more — not less — vulnerable to climate shocks. This is the sequencing problem many climate debates refuse to confront. The question is not whether the Philippines should decarbonize. It should, and it will. The real question is whether it can do so without undermining the very economic base that makes adaptation and resilience possible. The answer lies in disciplined pragmatism. Build renewables aggressively where they are cost-effective. Strengthen the grid. Improve market design. Encourage competition. Deploy storage when it makes economic sense, not when it makes headlines. And use conventional energy as the bridge it was always meant to be — not as a permanent crutch, but as insurance against fragility. In a world of absolutes, this approach may sound insufficiently heroic. But in the real world — where households pay bills, factories compete, and governments face elections — it is the only strategy that lasts. The Philippines cannot save the planet on its own. But it can refuse to impoverish itself chasing the illusion that it can. Climate responsibility, for a developing nation, is not about symbolic sacrifice. It is about building an economy strong enough to endure — and smart enough to transition without collapse. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] The truth about net-zero emissions,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-truth-net-zero-emissions/,Rappler
"HONG KONG – Filipino travelers, in particular, have been consistently among the top five visitors to Hong Kong’s Ocean Park since its inception decades ago, even until the pandemic, its management told Rappler. Families and groups of friends typically head to the resort and amusement park for its kiddie rides, family attractions, pandas, penguins, aquariums, hotels, and restaurants. But with most theme parks, seasonal festivals have always been at the heart of drawing in larger and newer crowds from neighboring countries. And from October until the start of November, Ocean Park Hong Kong has transformed into a Halloween playground filled with death-lightful decor, interactive exhibits, unique themes, and all sorts of eerie surprises that aren’t just for kids. Step into the park, and it all seems like family-friendly fun at first glance. But as the sun starts to set on Fridays to Sundays, and the night crowd trickles in — slowly but noisily, excitement buzzing in the air — the atmosphere begins to shift. As the sun sets, the park’s young staff are no longer in their usual uniforms. Elaborately dressed and meticulously made-up cosplayers begin to roam the grounds, turning Ocean Park into a cosplay-driven nightmare. You’ll see zombies, possessed dolls, famous serial killers, jesters, jack-o’-lanterns, and Día de los Muertos skeletons, all acting in character, with some even on stilts. They’ll lurk around, follow you a few steps, show off their props, and occasionally give you a little fright while walking beside you. Taking photos with them is easy — they’ll gladly stop for a scare-fie. The main highlight of this year’s Ocean Park Halloween Fest 2025: Unbox the Cursed Collection is its six haunted experiences. Long lines await (expect about 20 to 30 minutes on weekends), but with six houses to choose from, you can plan which jump-scare fix to get first. The most original one features Ocean Park’s very own Voodoo Boos, a cheeky and creepy nod to Hong Kong’s popular labubus. The Hatred Box pays homage to jack-in-the-box fears — a toy-themed horror maze where abandoned blind box toys return from to seek revenge. One fun twist: guests get to draw their own blind box inside for a chance to obtain a Voodoo Boo figure. The haunted workshop maze features twisted toys, blood-soaked eyeballs, scattered teeth, and severed limbs. For true crime fanatics and escape room lovers, The Unsolved Terrors dives into Hong Kong’s most horrific and seemingly “solved” cases. You’ll board an elevator and journey through different scenes to “uncover truths” drenched in gore. The prosthetics and displays — severed heads, guts spilling out of body parts, and dirty toilets — are eerily realistic here; it’s almost unsettling to look too closely, but the craft is worth admiring if you can stomach it. If you’re into sci-fi horror and mad scientists, H25: Rising Fear puts you inside a lab experiment gone wrong. Wearing a lab coat, you’ll race against time through frightening lab tasks that test your senses. Ocean Park’s haunted houses are not just run-and-scream experiences; the characters inside stay fully in character, turning it into a near-4D experience. Beyond the sights and sounds, there are even tactile moments — the smell of decay, the feel of crawling through tight tunnels, or squeezing through narrow hallways — all adding to the immersion. The Ritual Mansion is about a long-dormant cult that re-emerges to summon new followers for a forbidden blood sacrifice, and The Cannibal Woods, set outdoors, where you play a survivor of a plane crash in a forest, forced to follow an ill-fated expedition into the hunting grounds of a savage tribe. The Soul Graveyard brings color and less horror to the night, celebrating the Mexican Day of the Dead, but still with the occasional vengeful ghost. Each horror house concept is meticulously thought out, and every design is distinct. It’s possible to go through all six with The Halloween Ocean FasTrack, which is worth it if you don’t like waiting in long lines and want to skip queues. A thoughtful little touch — in line with the park’s world-famous pandas and its consideration for less-brave guests — is the Little Brother “De De” Badge – I Dare You badge, and Elder Sister “Jia Jia” Badge – Don’t Scare Me. The former signals to cosplayers that you’re game for scares; the latter politely tells them you’re not. While waiting or wandering between attractions, there are live performances scattered across the park once night falls. Bone-twisting monsters leap from boxes in Break and Rattle, while paper effigies rise from the grave in Diva Paper Doll Reviving Night. In Taoist and Zombies Jump Jump Jump, Taoist priests battle the undead through ritualistic choreography, while Demon Hunters take on rogue ghouls. At The Summit, Gangnam’s Devils — a boy group called NAMJA6 — bring K-pop on stage. The Boo-tiful Mariachi Band or Skullplay Jam adds rock music to the environment, and the Sparkle Sliders show off their roller-skating stunt choreography, sparking fire from their feet. Halloween-themed food and drinks are also available for the season. General admission to Ocean Park Hong Kong is HK$538 for adults (12 years old and above) and HK$269 for children aged 3 to 11. For the Halloween Fest, you can top up your park admission with a Trio Combo Ticket for access to three of the park’s signature haunted houses; either The Dark Spirits Trio Combo (Hatred Box, The Ritual Mansion, and The Cannibal Woods), or the Lost Souls Trio Combo (featuring The Unsolved Terrors, H25: Rising Fear, and The Soul Graveyard). The Trio Combo Tickets are priced at HK$280 per combo on peak dates (October 24–26, 29, 31, and November 1–2), and HK$238 on off-peak weekends (October 10–12 and 17–19). General admission tickets do not include access to the six haunted houses, and all combo tickets and Halloween Ocean FasTrack are on top of a valid admission ticket. Ocean Park Hong Kong has housed its own resorts within the estate since 2018. With the opening of the Hong Kong Ocean Park Marriott Hotel (2018), Water World Ocean Park Hong Kong (2021), and The Fullerton Ocean Park Hotel Hong Kong (2022), guests can walk from their accommodations to the park in five minutes. The Marriott is the more family-friendly pick, featuring panda decor and a 16-meter aquarium in the middle of its lobby: three stories high, filled with 800 fish and 500 species. A favorite of kids is watching the scuba diver feed the fish, especially when he’s dressed for the occasion — as a scuba-diving skeleton on Halloween, or Santa Claus come Christmas. The Fullerton, meanwhile, is a more luxurious five-star option, with beautiful bay-view rooms, an infinity pool up top, and an international lunch and dinner buffet. Located in Wong Chuk Hang on the southern side of Hong Kong Island, Ocean Park spans over 91.5 hectares across two main areas — The Waterfront and The Summit — connected by the scenic cable car and the Ocean Express underground train. – Rappler.com",True,true,More than family fun: What’s in store at Ocean Park Hong Kong this Halloween?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/ocean-park-hong-kong-halloween-fest-2025-events/,Rappler
"In the Philippines, where education often mirrors inequality, defined by geography, cost, and the ability to be physically present, the UP Open University (UPOU) has long been a quiet disruptor. It has insisted, for nearly three decades, that quality learning should not require a change of address, a plane ticket, or an expensive life uprooted from family. But in an era still dominated by brick-and-mortar thinking, a persistent belief survives that distance learning is “less than” traditional education, that it is a fallback option rather than a first choice. UPOU challenges this thinking head-on. For the millions of Filipinos who are too busy, too far, too burdened, or too invisible for conventional schooling such as farmers, indigenous youth, working parents, and especially OFWs, open and distance learning is not a compromise. It is the only way education becomes possible. During her investiture as UPOU Chancellor last July 30, 2025, Dr. Joane Serrano delivered a speech that landed like a compass for Philippine higher education. She reminded the academic community: “Open and distance education is not just a delivery mode, but a philosophy rooted in quality, inclusion, equity, and access.” Her words echo a foundational truth that education is not truly excellent until it is accessible. In the same speech, she acknowledged the historic role of UPOU, an institution built precisely for those whom the traditional university system has struggled to reach: “We were built for the underserved, the geographically distant, the working Filipinos, the OFWs… Those whose right to UP education remains just as valid, just as urgent.” That sense of urgency is what powers UPOU’s model, one that proves excellence does not require exclusivity. One of the clearest expressions of this model is UPOU’s Ventures for International and Transformative Academia (UP VINTA) for OFWs in Taiwan, a pioneering effort that brings structured learning to Filipino migrant workers where they are. For decades, OFWs were forced to choose: earn a living abroad or continue schooling at home. UPOU finally collapses that impossible binary. In dormitories across Taiwan, OFWs can now earn certificates, build portfolios, and prepare for reintegration, not years from now, but while they work. In a world where Filipino labor travels but opportunities do not always travel with them, this is a quiet revolution. Chancellor Serrano describes UPOU as a “Transformative University of the Future”, rooted in deep values yet unafraid to break tradition. Her framework rests on four pillars: This is not future talk for its own sake, it is deeply connected to the communities UPOU serves. In one of her strongest lines, Serrano reminds us what technology should truly be for: “Technology is a tool — never the goal itself. The heart of open and distance e-learning is in the lives we touch and transform.” This is especially true in sectors like agriculture, where climate change, aging farmers, and new technologies reshape daily survival. My work with Varacco and ThinnkFarm brings me deep into the realities of farmers, many of them innovators long before formal recognition. In our Farmer Scientist Training Program, we see farmers experiment with soils, observe climate shifts, and adapt production strategies with precision and instinct. What they lack is not intelligence, but access: to scientific frameworks, digital tools, and continuous learning. UPOU can provide a bridge. Distance education allows farmers to earn microcredentials on soil health, agroforestry, sustainability analytics, or climate adaptation without leaving their farms. It respects their time, their responsibilities, and their knowledge systems. This is what the University of the Future looks like: not a futuristic building, but an education system that moves with the rhythm of real life. For IP communities in Bukidnon or farmer groups in Batangas, learning becomes rooted, happening amid ancestral lands, amid seedlings and seasons, amid responsibilities that cannot simply be paused. In 2024, I shared reflections through the Asia New Zealand Foundation’s Young Business Leaders Initiative (YBLI). There, I emphasized how exposure to global conversations, diverse mentors, and new forms of leadership shapes entrepreneurs and changemakers. But exposure should not be exclusive to those who can afford flights, conferences, or urban universities. Open and distance learning democratizes exposure. It brings the world to anyone with a mobile phone and a commitment to learn. It decentralizes opportunity and disrupts the old idea that learning is something that happens only in select cities, behind select gates. For young entrepreneurs, rural women, or returning OFWs dreaming of a different trajectory, these open doors matter. Sustainability in business is not built on products alone, it is built on people. For enterprises like Varacco and ThinnkFarm, where technology intersects with agriculture, we rely on farmers trained in data literacy, climate-smart practices, regenerative agriculture, and digital tools. That kind of workforce cannot emerge from one-off seminars or annual workshops. It requires continuous, accessible learning ecosystems, the kind UPOU has been pioneering long before distance learning became fashionable. Education becomes infrastructure. Knowledge becomes public good. Communities become capable, not dependent. And when communities grow, businesses grow with them. The ultimate question — para kanino ang edukasyon? (For whom is education?) — is the one UPOU has answered again and again through its learners. It is for CEOs and business owners working 24/7. It is for OFWs studying after a long shift abroad. It is for mothers finishing modules after putting children to sleep. It is for IP youth balancing tradition and modern knowledge. It is for farmers who are scientists in practice. It is for second-chance learners rebuilding dreams. As Chancellor Serrano powerfully declared: “Opening the doors of UP is not a gesture of generosity, it is a commitment to justice.” In a time of widening inequality and accelerating climate shocks, this commitment is no longer optional. It is essential. The University of the Future is not a place we build, it is a principle we live. One where learning travels, where technology serves people, and where no Filipino is ever too far, too old, too busy, or too marginalized to grow. Para kanino ang edukasyon? Para sa bawat Pilipinong nangangarap. Para sa Pilipinong malayo. Para sa Pilipinong bumabangon. Para sa lahat. (It is for every Filipino who dreams. For every Filipino who is faraway.

"In politics, perception is as potent as policy. It’s not only what our public officials do that shapes trust, but also who surrounds them — especially when those relatives occupy sensitive positions in government or agencies dealing with public funds. The optics alone can be corrosive. Take, for instance, Edna Marcoleta, wife of Senator Rodante Marcoleta who sits as an independent director of Stronghold Insurance Company, the company which provided bonds to the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) flood control projects of Pacifico “Curlee” Discaya II and Cezarah Rowena “Sarah” Cruz Discaya. Or 83-year-old Evelyn Escudero, the mother of former Senate president Francis “Chiz” Escudero, who holds a directorial post in the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) — the same institution reportedly connected to Stronghold’s insurance deals. Technically, there’s nothing illegal there. These are appointments within the bounds of corporate and civil-service regulations. Yet public service is not merely about legality — it’s about integrity, propriety, and perception. When a senator’s wife or mother holds a post in an institution tied to government contracts or investment decisions, the public naturally wonders: Is political influence at play? These familial linkages cast a long shadow on transparency. At a time when the flood-control scandal has reignited public anger over political patronage and contractor collusion, such connections invite skepticism. Efforts to rebuild trust through independent probes will falter if these ethical blind spots persist. Power, after all, is not just exercised — it is seen. And when it appears that public office is intertwined with personal advantage, no amount of legalese can wash away the stain of impropriety. Public officials must therefore recognize the limits of perception. A simple surname — “Marcoleta” or “Escudero” — carries weight in the corridors of government. That alone should inspire prudence, not entitlement. Equally, our legislators and public figures must resist the temptation to be onion-skinned when criticized. The press does not exist to flatter power; it exists to test it. Journalists who point out potential conflicts of interest or patterns of influence are not enemies of the state — they are its conscience. Democracy thrives on sunlight, and those who wield authority must learn to live under its glare. When politicians’ families take positions in agencies or companies doing business with government, it may pass the letter of the law, but fails the higher test of public trust. In the end, the question is not whether it’s legal. The question is whether it’s right. And that’s a question every public servant — and their family members — must be ready to answer. GSIS records show Stronghold receiving notices of award, binders, notices to proceed, and lead-market certifications for GSIS’ property/engineering and catastrophe excess-of-loss programs across 2023–2025. Stronghold itself has publicized winning a major GSIS treaty. In short, Stronghold is part of GSIS’ insurance/reinsurance panels. Context that heightens the optics: GSIS is also Nat Re’s largest shareholder, and Mrs. Escudero chairs Nat Re — an entity historically included in GSIS-arranged reinsurance panels. That ownership/control web is legal and long-standing, but it sharpens “perception risk” when a senator’s mother sits on the GSIS board, while another senator’s spouse holds a board seat at a private insurer with GSIS awards. In brief: there is a verifiable institutional connection (GSIS ⇄ Stronghold), and verifiable family roles (Escudero in GSIS/Nat Re; Marcoleta in Stronghold). In the shadow of the ongoing flood-control controversy, the public is scrutinizing bonds, insurers, and reinsurance panels that backstop DPWH projects. When Stronghold appears in those conversations, and GSIS (where Ms. Escudero is a trustee) is awarding or coordinating cover where Stronghold is a participant, perception risk spikes — especially since Mrs. Marcoleta sits on Stronghold’s board. Even if every rule is followed (e.g. conflict-of-interest disclosures and recusals), the surnames alone amplify suspicion. That’s a governance problem of appearance as much as action. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Vantage Point] What’s in a name?

"NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – The steep drop in sugar millgate prices this milling season stems from over-importation that worsened under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., a labor group said on Wednesday, October 15. Wennie Sancho, secretary-general of the General Alliance of Workers Associations (GAWA), pointed out that Marcos, who has been in office for only three years, has already approved four controversial sugar import orders. Sugar Order No. 5, which allowed the importation of 300,000 metric tons in August 2022, became controversial when Marcos, also agriculture secretary, denied approving it, prompting the resignation of SRA Administrator Herminigildo Serafica and Board Member Roland Beltran. SO6 in early 2023 sought to import 440,000 MT but was blocked by Senator Risa Hontiveros, who called it “government-sponsored smuggling.” SO7 authorized 150,000 MT but was later shelved to protect local producers. Sancho said SO8, series of 2024-2025, allowed 425,000 MT of refined sugar that flooded the local market by mid-September, two weeks before the October 1 start of milling. “It’s blatant. The present administration is fond of importing sugar, sending the industry to its near death,” he said. The current sugar glut, estimated at 275,000 MT, has pushed prices down to about P2,200 per 50-kg bag, roughly P300 below the production cost of P2,500, Sancho added. Sancho called for a sugar summit to address the crisis, saying stakeholders must assess the industry’s condition and find ways to keep it afloat. Ten lawmakers from the Negros Island Region on Tuesday, October 14, called on the SRA to release data on sugar importation, pest infestation, and the shift in market demand from local to imported sugar. The group included Negros Occidental representatives Julio Ledesma IV, Alfredo Marañon III, Javier Miguel Benitez, Jeffrey Ferrer, Emilio Bernardino Yulo III, Mercedes Alvarez-Lansang, and Bacolod City’s Alfredo Abelardo Benitez, along with Negros Oriental Representatives Emmanuel Iway, Maisa Sagarbarria, and Janice Degamo. One of them, Javier Miguel Benitez, filed House Resolution No. 373, urging the House committees on agriculture, trade, and labor to investigate the sugar price problem. Former SRA administrator Rafael Coscolluela, an ex-governor, said earlier “there is too much supply of sugar at the wrong time,” faulting the SRA for failing to balance supply and demand. Aurelio Gerardo Valderrama Jr., president of the Confederation of Sugar Producers Incorporated (CONFED), also wrote an open letter to SRA Administrator Pablo Azcona questioning whether the implications of oversupply and artificial sweeteners were properly assessed before the latest imports. CONFED asked the SRA for its plan to stabilize prices, control oversupply, and regulate sweeteners that are displacing locally produced sugar.

"LOS ANGELES, USA º Wearing a green sweater and tan pants against a bright blue screen, Marvel comic book superhero creator Stan Lee will return to LA Comic Con in holographic form to meet fans of his characters including Spider-Man, Hulk, Iron Man and Thor. Fans can interact with a hologram of Lee, who died in 2018 at the age of 95, in an enclosed booth at the Los Angeles Convention Center. “It was obviously sad for many of us when Stan passed,” said Chris DeMoulin, chief executive of Comikaze Entertainment, which operates Los Angeles Comic Con. “For the last couple of years, we’ve been talking about things we might be able to do to help extend Stan’s legacy.” About six months ago, DeMoulin said he came up with the idea of creating an avatar of Lee to serve as an “entry point for fans, old and new, into the Marvel universe.” The project was a collaboration of Proto Hologram, a company whose holographic technology has been used in malls to promote films such as The Conjuring and A Minecraft Movie, and Hyperreal, an artificial intelligence firm that creates realistic-looking digital humans. The hologram was trained on Stan Lee’s myriad appearances on red carpets and at fan conventions. Fans who never met Lee in person might recognize him from his cameo appearances in every live-action Marvel movie made during his lifetime. “This avatar will never say something that Stan didn’t say,” said DeMoulin. “It will never have a point of view about Marvel or the stories or Stan’s role in them that hasn’t come directly from something Stan has said.” Mammoth Vision’s George Johnson said that they used technological guardrails to prevent Lee from saying something out of character. “We take Stan Lee’s words and import them into the model and then we put rails on the side of it,” said Johnson, “So he doesn’t go off and talk about things that Stan wouldn’t have said.” In a demonstration Friday, holographic Lee talked about his love of fan conventions. “My favorite thing about being at a comic convention is getting to meet all the amazing fans and hearing their stories about how Marvel has impacted their lives,” Lee said in the late actor’s voice. Not everyone welcomed Lee’s posthumous appearance at the convention. Some commenters on Reddit criticized the Stan Lee Experience. “Even in death, they won’t let the guy rest,” wrote one commenter, posting under the name RGCBlade. “It’s all pretty dystopian.” – Rappler.com",True,true,AI hologram of Stan Lee debuts at LA Comic Con,https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/artificial-intelligence-stan-lee-debut-los-angeles-comic-con-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Construction company EEI Corporation acquired the firm which owns the defunct Philippine offshore gaming operator (POGO) hub Island Cove in Kawit, Cavite. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Thursday, October 16, the Yuchengco-backed firm said it acquired First Orient International Ventures Corporation (FOIVC) from KC Land Oriental Pacific Incorporated for P2.8 billion. EEI described FOIVC as a domestic corporation that acquires, develops, sells, and leases real estate properties. It currently owns and has rights over 49 hectares of land in Cavite, including the 30-hectare Island Cove property. EEI said it aims to diversify its portfolio through the acquisition. “The acquisition of FOIVC is part of the company’s long-term growth strategy to evolve from a pure-play construction company into a fully integrated property and infrastructure developer,” it said. Dubbed the country’s largest POGO hub, Island Cove shut down operations in November 2024 after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced a ban on POGOs during his State of the Nation Address that year. The property was once a resort owned by the Remulla family. According to Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla, their family sold the property to FOIVC in 2018. The company then repurposed it into a POGO hub in 2019. Leyte 1st District Representative Martin Romualdez also previously owned 20% of EEI in a 2023 deal with his family’s holding firm RYM Business Management. However, EEI chief executive officer Henry Antonio acquired the stake of the former House speaker through a management buyout in March.

"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) formalized an agreement to promote fair competition in public procurement and infrastructure development. DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon and PCC Chair Michael Aguinaldo signed a memorandum of agreement on Thursday, October 23. The agreement formalizes DPWH and PCC cooperation in detecting and addressing anti-competitive behavior in public works projects such as the rigging of bids. The partnership between the DPWH and the country’s anti-trust watchdog comes amid ongoing investigations into alleged corruption plaguing public works projects. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. earlier flagged that just 15 contractors bagged 20% of all flood control projects nationwide. Those found guilty of engaging in anti-competitive agreements such as bid-rigging may face fines of up to P110 million for the first offense, P110 million to P275 million for the second offense, and up to P275 million for the third and succeeding offenses. The two agencies also committed to proactively monitor market conduct and collaborate on a review of DPWH’s policies to ensure they align with the Philippines’ anti-trust law. The agreement also enables the formation of joint task forces for investigations. Dizon described the agreement as part of reforms to cleanse the ranks of the DPWH and return the stolen funds to the government. Aguinaldo also said that one way the funds can be returned is through the imposition of fines for anti-competitive behavior. “It can reach so many hundreds of billions, possibly if we’re able to show for each case that there’s a violation, if you add them all up, it can reach that much. So, indirectly it’s a way of getting the money back,” he said. The PCC chief, however, clarified that this is different from the Ombudsman and Solicitor General’s attempts to recover the funds. – Rappler.com",True,true,DPWH teams up with PCC to promote fair competition in public works projects,https://www.rappler.com/business/dpwh-pcc-partnership-fair-competition-public-works-projects/,Rappler
"BANGKOK, Thailand – Before it became one of Thailand’s most beloved public parks, Rotfai Park was once a golf course. That’s hard to imagine now, with the trees grown tall and the green grass open to all. There are no golf carts here; the air hummed with bicycles and chatter. Families picnic by the grove under the shade, runners pound the paved paths, and food vendors set up their tents near the entrance for the weekend market. For the locals, it’s an ordinary Saturday. But as a visitor, I couldn’t help the ache of longing and envy. Back home, we’d have called all this private property — which brings us to Intramuros. This story used to end with a frustrated question — why can’t we have open spaces? Intramuros was one of the clearest reasons it felt impossible. A vast expanse of green in the heart of Manila, that, for more than a century, has largely been reserved for a narrow pool of people. The argument often goes that it has always been this way, and heritage dictates that we have to uphold this privileged access. But something has changed. Since November 23, the Club Intramuros Golf Course has been opening its greens every Sunday as a public recreational space, with golf pausing for the day. It’s a start. A cautious one, yes, with boundaries still in place, as if the grass might be ruined by ordinary feet. But the direction is there. Is it enough? Hardly. Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso has been blunt about what he wants next: converting the site into the Intramuros Forest Park, a long-term project he frames as inclusive and sustainable, on the argument that the land is underutilized and benefits only a few. “Recently, may mga nagwawalang golfer. Akala mo ba sila ang may-ari at karapatan. Nanggalaiti sila na bakit daw gagawing park? Tingnan n’yo ang argument. Talagang mahahalata mo na mga taong makasarili,” Moreno said on December 3 as reported by Manila Bulletin. (Recently, there have been some angry golfers. You’d think they owned the rights to the land. They’re angry at it being turned into a park? Look at their argument. You can really tell they’re selfish people.) Moreno will face an uphill battle prying Intraumuros away. And to be fair, the pushback isn’t only emotional. There are real concerns about jobs and tourism revenue if the golf course is converted. But it’s not like the land will vanish; it will be repurposed. A forest park conversion can be done in phases, with Sunday openings serving as a test run rather than a token gesture. If anything, the fact that Intramuros can already open one day a week proves the point: the city can share this space. Beyond Intramuros, think of Wack Wack, Veterans, Villamor, Manila Golf, and more. It’s not that the metro lacks green space, or that every “park” is really just a concrete slab with tufts of dried grass. Though, to be fair, the few parks we do have fit that description. No — the land exists. In fact, we have dozens upon dozens of hectares kept green for the same purpose. So why do we keep reserving it for the few? Now, back to Thailand, so you can see what this looks like when a city commits to the idea fully. Bangkok’s Wachirabenchathat Park, popularly known as Suan Rotfai, shows what could happen if we chose differently. Rotfai Park wasn’t always open to the public. The land once belonged to the State Railway of Thailand and served as its private golf course. In 2002, the government decided to turn it into a public park and renamed it as Wachirabenchathat Park in honor of then-Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn’s 50th birthday. It was a symbolic gesture, opening up the exclusive green as a shared space. Much of the park’s layout still hints at its past, with wide fairway-like lawns now repurposed into jogging and cycling paths. In fact, the name Suan Rotfai literally means “Train Park.” We start at the weekend market by the entrance, a field of white and blue tents. Vendors sell everything from mango sticky rice to grilled chicken and some of the best salmon katsu I’ve tasted. Though the market is nowhere as big as nearby Chatuchak, it’s still lively, laid out in neat rows, and easy to navigate. In fact, it feels like a bigger, better-organized version of the Salcedo or Legazpi weekend markets back home. Despite being so wildly popular, both are pretty much confined to a narrow stretch of road and a parking lot. But that shows Filipinos have the appetite for that kind of gathering; if we built better, greener community spaces, weekend markets of this scale would surely follow. Before you enter the park, you also have the option to rent a bike, and you’ll definitely need one if you hope to see every part of the enormous 60-hectare property. How big is big anyway? Well, Rotfai Park is more than 200 times the size of Arroceros Forest Park, Manila’s so-called “last lung.” Once you step inside Rotfai Park, you’ll find that there’s more than enough room for everyone. Cyclists glide through the biking lanes, safely apart from joggers who keep to their own separate path. Couples sit on benches. Families nap on picnic mats. There are basketball courts, beach volleyball areas, tennis courts, football fields, and even a fitness center. If team sports aren’t your thing, there’s plenty of outdoor gym equipment and a big playground, where children chase each other and the elderly work up a light sweat. There’s space not just for people but for nature too. Wooded areas have enough trees to almost feel like small forests. Ravens squawk overhead and idle by the streams, ponds, and creeks that cut through the park. If you’re lucky – or perhaps, unlucky – you might even catch a monitor lizard sunbathing by the water’s edge. Rotfai Park is actually part of a larger complex of interconnected parks, including the Queen Sirikit Park next door. Though smaller than Rotfai, it lives up to its regal name. The entrance from within Rotfai hides itself like a well-kept secret: a narrow bridge shrouded by foliage that suddenly opens into promenades lined with flowers. Fountains ripple in the distance, and pools of water cradle blooming lotus flowers. In some corners of the park, the creeks run quietly beneath the trees, and between the leaves you can see Bangkok’s skyline glittering in the distance. It’s easy to forget, but this refuge lies right in the center of one of Asia’s busiest economic centers. The air here is warm and heavy, but not uncomfortable. It smells faintly of earth and blossoms. People stroll quietly, their conversations soft and unhurried, lost in the open space. And what space it is. That, perhaps, is what people forget they need – room to breathe, to move, to simply exist. That, too, is what the Philippines keeps missing. So if Thailand could turn an old golf course into a park where anyone can walk, sit, or think, why can’t we? – Rappler.com",True,true,Bangkok turned a golf course into a park.

"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Francis Lim’s recent statement on the tiered public-float proposal serves as a firm reminder that the circular remains a living draft, not a predetermined outcome. By stressing that “no one should expect to have their way” and nothing is final, Lim positions the SEC as an institution committed to open consultation rather than regulatory capture. His message is aimed equally at large issuers lobbying for lower floats and investor groups pressing for stricter thresholds: the reform will move only on the strength of data, liquidity considerations, and long-term market impact, not on pressure campaigns or political noise. By asserting that the SEC “will decide solely on what is right for the market, not on who shouts the loudest,” Lim is signaling a recalibration of regulatory discipline at a critical moment for Philippine capital markets. The remark reinforces the agency’s independence and asserts that the final framework will balance competing interests with an eye toward credibility, liquidity depth, and investor protection. In a market hungry for both modernization and trust, this posture of principled neutrality may prove as important as the float reform itself. The arrival of Lim at the helm of SEC has injected an unusual burst of energy into a capital market long accustomed to incrementalism. Lim, a seasoned capital-markets lawyer and former Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) president, has wasted little time diagnosing the country’s structural deficiencies: too few listed companies, chronically shallow liquidity, and a regulatory architecture that has not kept pace with neither the scale of modern issuers nor the demands of global investors. In the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) cross-country comparisons, the Philippines consistently posts one of the lowest market-capitalization-to-GDP ratios among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and an anemic pipeline of new listings. For years, regulators lamented these indicators but delivered only modest reforms. Lim, to his credit, is attempting a more comprehensive reset. The OECD is a global policy institution made up of 38 member countries, mostly high-income economies, that work together to shape economic, social, financial, and regulatory standards. (READ: Value trap: Why the PSE is one of world’s worst-performing markets) The most controversial — and potentially transformative — piece of that reset is the SEC’s newly released exposure draft introducing a tiered minimum public-float framework for initial public offerings (IPO). It replaces the long-standing flat 20% rule with a size-sensitive ladder: 33% float for companies valued at P500 million or below; 25% for those up to P1 billion; 20% for those with mid-capitalization up to P50 billion; 15% for large issuers between P50 billion and P150 billion; and a sharply lower 12% for mega-capitalized ones above P150 billion, provided they still comply with minimum peso-value thresholds. Unsurprisingly, this triggered applause from some corners of the market and discomfort from others. Large issuers, particularly financial technology companies (fintechs) and conglomerate carve-outs contemplating blockbuster listings, see at last a regulatory regime that understands the absorptive limits of a shallow market. But governance advocates worry that a 12% float is dangerously thin, potentially entrenching already powerful controlling families, while conferring on them the reputational benefits of public status. As with most things in market microstructure, the truth lies in the interplay of incentives, liquidity dynamics, and regulatory discipline. To understand the logic of the reform, one must begin with the basic arithmetic of an IPO. Under the old flat 20% rule, a ₱300-billion company contemplating a listing would have been forced to unload ₱60 billion worth of shares. In a market where annual total turnover often hovers at levels smaller than that single issuance, such supply would overwhelm both domestic institutions and foreign funds. The policy, well-intentioned as it was, all but guaranteed that large, fast-growing companies would stay private, list abroad, or avoid the public markets entirely. The tiered framework is an explicit attempt to remove this structural bottleneck. By contrast, a small- or mid-sized issuer presents an entirely different problem. Thin public floats in the micro-cap and small-cap segment are notorious breeding grounds for cornering, insider-driven spikes, and price manipulation. Requiring a higher float — 33% for the smallest, 25% for the next tier — improves price discovery, broadens investor participation, and protects retail buyers who rely on transparent, competitive order books rather than insider networks. These companies tend to have limited analyst coverage, small free floats, and often volatile trading profiles. More public float in this space — not less — is precisely the corrective the market needs. Viewed through this lens, the tiering system is not a deregulation of floats; it is a reallocation of regulatory strictness. The SEC is tightening the float requirement where governance and liquidity risks are highest and loosening it where the 20% threshold was practically preventing listings altogether. In pure policy design terms, it is one of the more rational calibrations that the market has seen in a decade. But the reform’s potential must be weighed against its risks. A 12% float for mega-caps raises legitimate concerns about market integrity. In markets where shareholder activism is weak and related-party transactions remain a systemic governance challenge, allowing controlling shareholders to retain 88% of equity, while tapping public capital, magnifies the risk of minority squeeze-out, valuation opacity, and governance complacency. If the peso-value floor is not rigorously enforced, a mega-cap could list with just enough public shares to meet the letter of the rule, while starving the market of genuine liquidity. Worse, if such companies are admitted to the main index, passive funds with mechanical allocation rules would be compelled to buy into a tightly held name with limited free float, magnifying price distortion in both directions. For this reason, the float rule cannot be evaluated in isolation. It lives or dies based on the SEC’s ability to strengthen the surrounding regulatory guardrails: audit enforcement, related-party scrutiny, valuation standards, and disclosure discipline. This is where Lim’s broader reform agenda becomes relevant. The SEC under his leadership has begun clearing internal backlogs, simplifying procedural requirements, redesigning registration and IPO workflows, and pushing the implementation of the Capital Markets Efficiency Promotion Act (CMEPA). The commission is also refining the rules governing REITs, syncing reinvestment timelines with market realities and widening the definition of income-generating assets. On the non-bank financial side, consumer-protection reforms aim to curb abusive collection practices and strengthen disclosure obligations. In other words, the tiered float is arriving within a larger regulatory modernization plan, not as a standalone experiment. If the SEC follows through, this creates a scaffolding robust enough to support a more flexible float regime. The remaining question is whether such a regime is favorable to the market as a whole. On this, a forensic reading of liquidity mechanics, investor behavior, and historical precedent points to a cautiously affirmative answer. When markets lack sector diversity, foreign investors treat them as tactical short-term trades rather than strategic long-term allocations. A more flexible float structure is a prerequisite for bringing in the kind of mega-cap issuers that alter index composition, attract global funds, and produce spillover liquidity across the board. The biggest unknown is issuer behavior. Will SMEs balk at the higher float requirement and opt out of the IPO track altogether? Possibly. Some family-owned businesses may prefer debt or private equity to preserve control. But others — especially those eyeing expansion capital — may find that a larger float broadens their appeal and stabilizes post-IPO trading. Conversely, will mega-caps list more readily now that they can float 15% or 12% instead of 20%? Yes. The cost-benefit calculus shifts, particularly for issuers whose scale would have required unloading tens of billions of pesos under the old rule. Ultimately, the tiered float framework is not a guarantee of market revival. It is merely the removal of one of the structural barriers that kept the market stagnant. Its success will hinge on execution: whether the SEC enforces the new rules without exception, whether it cracks down on valuation abuses like the recent audit and appraisal controversies, and whether the exchange revisits index inclusion rules to avoid overweighting tightly controlled companies. Francis Lim has placed a strategic wager: that market expansion, not rigid governance orthodoxy, is what the Philippine capital market needs most at this moment. It is a bet grounded in the economic realities of a shallow market that must compete regionally for listings, liquidity, and investor attention. But it is not without risk. A float that is too low can breed opacity; a float that is too high for mega-caps can kill deals. The new framework attempts to walk that tightrope. The real test will come not in the rule’s publication, but in the deals it enables — or fails to enable — over the next 24 months. If major issuers finally list, if liquidity deepens, and if governance enforcement keeps pace, the reform will be remembered as the turning point. If not, it will join the long list of well-meaning regulatory adjustments that failed to move the needle. For now, the verdict is neither triumph nor cautionary tale. It is a rare moment of regulatory ambition in a market that sorely needs it. The revival of Philippine capital markets will require more than a new float regime. But without it, revival would not come at all. – Rappler.com Click here for more Vantage Point articles",True,true,[Vantage Point] SEC’s float gambit: Shaking the stock market from deep slumber,https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/vantage-point-securities-exchange-commission-float-gambit/,Rappler
"BAGUIO, Philippines – The morning drizzle did little to dampen spirits as the sound of gongs, drums, and cheers filled the streets of Baguio on Friday, October 24. Dancers in full traditional attire moved with energy and pride, their performances a celebration of Cordilleran culture. It was a day when the region’s diversity came together as one, the Festival of Festivals 2025, now on its fourth year in the City of Pines. The parade began at Harrison Road and made its way up Session Road, featuring the major festivals of the Cordillera provinces: Abra’s Kawayan Festival, Apayao’s Say-am, Benguet’s Adivay, Ifugao’s Gotad ad Ifugao, Kalinga’s Bodong Festival, and Mountain Province’s Lang-ay Festival, alongside the Panagbenga Festival of Baguio City, and the Matagoan Festival of Tabuk City. Each contingent brought to life its people’s stories of peace pacts, harvests, thanksgiving, and resilience. As the beating of the gangsa echoed through the air to signal the opening of the event, the scene was both festive and reverent. “The strength of the Philippines lies not only in its landscapes but in its peoples,” said Tourism Secretary Christina Garcia Frasco, who graced the ceremony with Department of Tourism-Cordillera Regional Director Jovita Ganongan, Representative Mauricio Domogan, and Vice Mayor Faustino Olowan. Ganongan described the Festival of Festivals as “a grand showcase of the region’s premier celebrations, offering visitors a glimpse of Cordillera’s living traditions and creativity.” The event, she added, fosters regional pride and invites more travelers to explore beyond Baguio — to the mountains and communities that make up the Cordillera identity. Each performance told a story. From Ifugao’s Gotad, where dancers reenacted the Hudhud chants and harvest rituals, to Kalinga’s Bodong, a thunderous declaration of unity and peace punctuated by their Guinness World Record–holding gong ensemble. Benguet’s Adivay painted a portrait of mountain resilience, while Abra’s Kawayan honored the strength and flexibility of bamboo. In Apayao’s Say-am, the joy of thanksgiving flowed like the rivers that feed their farmlands, and Mountain Province’s Lang-ay evoked gratitude and renewal through the sacred Begnas ritual of Bauko. The five-day celebration also features a regional crafts and products exhibit at Malcolm Square, running until October 26. Visitors can experience traditional weaving, woodcarving, and local delicacies that tell as much about the Cordilleras as the dances and songs themselves. This year’s festival also commemorates Indigenous Peoples’ Month under Proclamation No. 1906, Series of 2009, which honors the 1997 signing of the Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act, a law that protects ancestral lands and celebrates cultural diversity. For Secretary Frasco, the day was a proud affirmation of Filipino identity. “Each festival was distinct, evincing a diversity that makes you appreciate the richness of our culture,” she said. “The authenticity of the performances — the age-old rituals, the stories, the movements — remind us of how deeply our heritage runs.” – Rappler.com",True,true,"Colors, culture, Cordilleran pride shine at Festival of Festivals 2025",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/cordillera-festival-of-festivals-2025/,Rappler
"TACLOBAN, Philippines – Long before his paintings reached the walls of an international museum in Beijing, China, Dante Enage was simply trying to survive. Like thousands of others in Eastern Visayas, Enage lived through the devastation of Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), a disaster that flattened homes, erased livelihoods, and left deep emotional scars. Yolanda struck the central Philippines in November 2013 and remains one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded. It killed more than 6,000 people and devastated large parts of Eastern Visayas, including Tacloban City, where Enage lived and worked. In the years that followed, Tacloban continued to rebuild not only its infrastructure and houses, but also its sense of normalcy. For Enage, rebuilding took a different form. He picked up his brushes and began again. “Bilang isang Yolanda survivor, bumangon ako. Naging tema ko ang pagiging matatag, pagkakaisa, at pag-asa,” he told Rappler on Friday, January 2. (As a Yolanda survivor, I rose again. Resilience, unity, and hope became my themes.) There were no art galleries to welcome him and no steady platforms to showcase his work. Being an artist in the province meant working on the margins and creating without guarantees, recognition, or financial security. But Enage stayed. Over a decade later, that persistence led him somewhere he never imagined. He was selected for the Beijing International Art Biennale, a major global contemporary art exhibition that features works from artists around the world and promotes international artistic exchange. In 2025, Enage joined a small group of Filipino artists who have earned the same distinction, including Dennis Montera, Maximino Balatbat II, Cristina Taniguchi, Samuel Penaso, and Teody Boylie R. Perez. For an artist who began with almost nothing, the moment carried quiet weight. Enage describes his work as contemporary art, but what defines it most is where it comes from. “Combination ito ng abstract expressionism, realism, at symbolism. Walang fixed rules. Pure experimentation at expression,” he said. (It is a combination of abstract expressionism, realism, and symbolism. There are no fixed rules. It is pure experimentation and expression.) His paintings are filled with movement, organic shapes, layered textures, and flowing forms. What makes them unmistakably his are the Pintados tattoo patterns and Baybayin script embedded into the surface. “These patterns are my identity,” Enage said. “They tell people where I come from, Tacloban, Leyte.” They are not decorative details. They are statements. Even on a global stage, Enage remains rooted in home. The themes that recur in his work – resilience, healing, cultural preservation, and environmental care – reflect the life he has lived. After Yolanda, survival itself became a form of education. “Bumangon ang naging tema ko. Maging matatag. Magkaisa. Umasa,” he added. (Rising again became my theme. To be steadfast. To be united. To choose hope.) Life as an artist in the province has never been easy. Enage spoke openly about the realities. “Mahirap maging artist sa probinsya,” he said. “Walang gallery. Mahirap mag-survive, lalo na kung may pamilya ka na.”(It is difficult to be an artist in the province. There are no galleries. It is hard to survive, especially if you already have a family.) There were long periods without sales, times when bills had to be paid and paintings remained unsold. But quitting never crossed his mind. “Hindi ako sumuko. Naghirap lang. Nag-isip lang kung paano mag-survive. Ito ang calling ko,” he said.(I did not give up. I simply struggled and figured out how to survive. This is my calling.) When materials were too expensive, he improvised. In his early years, he even used tuba (coconut wine) as a painting medium because it was available. “Kung walang pambili ng acrylic o oil, tumingin ka lang sa paligid,” he said, smiling. (If you cannot afford acrylic or oil, you just look around you.) Much of his early confidence came from his mentor, Steve Acerden, a respected Tacloban artist who guided him in the 1990s. Enage called Acerden an art genius who was the first to believe in him, and who greatly influenced him. The Beijing International Art Biennale is not a competition, but selection requires passing three jury screenings. Enage said he nearly missed his chance, ignoring the call for submission at first because “sanay kasi akong may bayad ang mga ganito.” (I am used to things like this requiring a fee.) He said it was fellow artist Sam Penaso who urged him to apply, pointing out that the submission was free and that the deadline was that same day. Enage submitted “Patterned Paradise 1,” an acrylic-on-canvas work measuring 133 x 165 centimeters. He created it without sketches, building the image layer by layer through instinct and experimentation. “Walang plano. Spontaneous lahat. Yung idea sumusunod na lang habang ginagawa ko,” he said. (There was no plan. Everything was spontaneous. The idea simply followed as I worked.) The painting imagines a world where birds, plants, and abstract forms coexist, reflecting the Biennale’s theme of coexistence. “Hindi tayo hiwalay sa kalikasan. Parte tayo nito,” Enage explained. (We are not separate from nature. We are part of it.) Months later, the results were released. Enage passed all three screenings. “Malaking karangalan iyon,” he said. (It was a great honor.) Despite being selected, Enage was unable to travel to Beijing. Limited funds and visa processing delays during the holiday season made the trip impossible. He said there was disappointment, but no bitterness. “The selection itself is already exposure. Tacloban and Leyte are already on the map.” From a storm survivor in a province with no galleries to an artist recognized on the world stage, Dante Enage’s journey is quiet and steady. It is patient and earned. Like the layers in his paintings, it is a story that took time to reveal its beauty. Today, Enage continues to work quietly from Tacloban, carrying his community with him in every piece. He said his family and community are the foundation of his art. “Kolektibong kwento ito (This is a collective story),” he added.To young artists in Eastern Visayas, his advice is direct and grounded. Practice every day. Learn patiently. Find mentors. Do not rush success. “Huwag mong unahin ang benta. Unahin mo ang paghinog ng obra mo,” he said. (Do not prioritize sales. Prioritize the improvement of your art.) At the core of everything he creates is a simple message: “Take care of Mother Nature, because if we take care of her, she will also take care of us.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Tacloban artist brings resilience and culture to Beijing Art Biennale,https://www.rappler.com/people/tacloban-city-artist-dante-enage-beijing-art-biennale/,Rappler

European online fashion retailer Zalando is also using AI to create imagery faster. “We are using artificial intelligence only to complement our existing processes,” a spokesperson for Zara owner Inditex said in a statement. “We work collaboratively with our valued models — agreeing any aspect on a mutual basis — and compensate in line with industry best practice.” Zara’s move was first reported by London business-focused newspaper CityAM, which cited an unnamed model saying Zara asked for approval to edit images of them with AI to show different items, and that they were paid the same amount as if they had travelled for another photo shoot. H&M and Zalando, like Inditex, have said AI would complement their creative teams’ processes and help them be more efficient rather than replacing them, downplaying the risk to photographers and production teams who work on fashion shoots. Inditex chair Marta Ortega, daughter of the founder Amancio Ortega, has spoken in interviews about her passion for fashion photography. Since 2021 her MOP (Marta Ortega Perez) Foundation gallery in A Coruna, the town in northern Spain where Zara was founded, has hosted exhibitions showcasing the work of major photographers. It is currently showing Annie Leibovitz’s fashion photography, and previous exhibitions have spotlighted photography greats Steven Meisel — with whom Zara has worked extensively — and Helmut Newton. Ortega has tried to move Zara upmarket, cutting store numbers to focus on fewer, bigger flagships with a more spacious, sophisticated feel. Isabelle Doran, CEO of the Association of Photographers in London, said the use of AI would reduce the number of times photographers, models and production teams are commissioned, impacting a whole ecosystem of established professionals as well as early-career fashion photographers trying to get a foothold in the industry. – Rappler.com",True,true,Zara turns to AI to generate fashion imagery using real-life models,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/style/zara-ai-fashion-imagery-real-life-models/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Vice President Sara Duterte’s Isang Kaibigan children’s book has become the topic of heated discussions and memes. The book surfaced at the Senate budget deliberations on the 2025 proposed budget of the Office of the Vice President (OVP) on Tuesday, August 20. Senator Risa Hontiveros questioned what the book that was allocated P10 million under the proposed budget was about, leading to Duterte accusing Hontiveros of politicizing the hearing in an intense exchange. Filipino netizens were quick to poke fun at the book, creating memes that referenced Duterte’s past controversies — like her punching a court sheriff in 2011 when she was Davao City mayor, and her recent personal trip to Germany during Typhoon Carina. But Isang Kaibigan has sparked a new conversation: whether its similarities to the 2009 children’s graphic novel Owly: Just a Little Blue by Andy Runton are just a coincidence. Isang Kaibigan takes on the theme of true friends who help you during tough times. It follows Kwago, an owl who loses his home and all his belongings to a storm. He is then kept company by one friend, Loro, a parrot who helps him rebuild his nest after the onslaught of the heavy rains. Meanwhile, Owly: Just a Little Blue follows best friends Owly and Wormy, who help a family of bluebirds living in a damaged tree build a new home. However, the family didn’t like it as much as Owly and Wormy would have hoped. When a storm comes, the two friends immediately remember the bluebirds and start working on helping them seek shelter from the rain. It’s the second book in Andy Runton’s graphic novel series Owly, which was first published in 2004. Owly: Just a Little Blue‘s original, black-and-white edition with no text was published in 2009. It was later republished in 2020 in full color, and with text. Just as there are observed similarities, there are also marked differences in the two books, particularly in their main characters. In Isang Kaibigan, Kwago is surrounded by friends until he lost everything during a storm. He was in despair and felt helpless until his last remaining friend came to his rescue. In Just a Little Blue, Owly is a kind, generous, and pro-active character who goes out of his way to help others and, in the process, gains friends. Author and activist Ninotchka Rosca first posted about Owly: Just a Little Blue, on Wednesday, August 21, explaining the book’s synopsis. “Ay, natawa ako (I laughed),” Rosca wrote right after the book’s description. Other Filipino writers then began to take notice of the supposed similarities between Duterte’s book and Runton’s book. Rappler columnist Antonio J. Montalvan II questioned if the reason behind Duterte’s outburst during her exchange with Hontiveros was because the book was plagiarized. “Is this the reason for the tantrum? The question was simple – what is the book about? Then she flared up. Dahil ba [plagiarized] ang book (Is it because the book is plagiarized)? That’s [P10 million] for possible plagiarism,” Montalvan wrote. Meanwhile, another netizen called on others to search up the other Owly books to check for plagiarism, also speculating that this could be the reason why Duterte had gotten upset during the budget hearing. In an X post, journalist Raissa Robles also asked Runton to check if he thinks Isang Kaibigan bears any similarities with his book. To @Owly – Pls look if this book looks similar to yours. Thanks. https://t.co/7ynveGhKFn As of this writing, however, Runton has yet to comment on the matter. As accusations of plagiarism spread online, Vice President Duterte issued a statement rejecting the claims, saying it was easy to write a short story based on experience, and hinted on her upcoming book about betrayal. Isang Kaibigan is part of the OVP’s flagship program, “PagbaBAGo Campaign,” where one million beneficiaries will receive bags that contain the book. The book is 16 pages long, and was published by the OVP. – Rappler.com",True,true,Did ‘Owly: Just a Little Blue’ inspire Sara Duterte’s ‘Isang Kaibigan’ book?,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/literature/owly-just-a-little-blue-sara-duterte-isang-kaibigan/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines — From writing as a music journalist to crafting her debut graphic novel infused with Philippine mythology, Filipino author-illustrator Kara Bodegón-Hikino proves that childhood dreams really do come true, as long as you keep chasing them. Even before she studied Multimedia Arts at De La Salle-College of St. Benilde, Kara already wanted to become a marine biologist to study sharks. Her career may have taken her to the music and entertainment industry instead, but the ocean — and everything mysterious about it — never really left the heart of her art. Now, her illustrations feature not only this prehistoric ocean animal but, more interestingly, the precolonial. Through her upcoming graphic novel, Squalo & Mage vs The Rage of the Bakunawa — the first in a duology — Kara reimagines a mystical world where Filipino mythology, music, and culture collide. Since 2011, Kara has written about music across the local and international scenes for publications such as Billboard, Bandwagon Asia, and PULP Magazine. With her background as a cartoon illustrator, she has also been merging music with her own art, designing album covers and posters for artists such as D. Randall Blythe of Lamb of God, Daniel Tompkins of Tesseract, Tilly Birds, The Itchyworms, Lola Amour, and AOUI. More recently, she launched her small online art shop, Karakugaki, collaborating with local coffee shops and pizza joints in Manila. For a writer-illustrator who has experienced the world of live music up close, from the concert’s backstage to the photo pit, Kara shared that the idea for her proudly Pinoy graphic novel sparked, in fact, from an OPM song. “Squalo & Mage started as a mini comic about how I heard a certain December Avenue song wherever I went,” she said. “Long story short, I pitched the idea of turning it into a graphic novel to literary agents, signed with my dream agent, and ultimately scored a book deal. Fully bringing it to life took me around five years, so this story isn’t short at all,” added Kara, who is represented by Sara Crowe of Sara Crowe Literary, LLC. After becoming a mother, Kara expressed in her blog that she briefly lost touch with her creative spark. During that time, she found herself busy with commissions and “frustrated with the color choices” she was designing for Squalo & Mage. “I never thought I’d feel this kind of joy in creating again,” she wrote. Despite this, she shared how helpful it is to reach out to others when “stuck” and surround oneself with empowering stories. Soon, she began to feel those “little sparks” again, reminding her that even the most passionate artists can feel burned out, and acknowledging this is often the first step toward finding one’s rhythm again. While her new story dives deep into Filipino culture and folklore — with notable references such as the baro’t saya (blouse and skirt) and the bahay kubo (nipa hut) — Kara also sneaks in playful nods to the country’s musical roots through “easter eggs” that OPM fans might recognize. “Most of my professional career was spent bringing the spotlight to Filipino music, and including a bit of that world in Squalo & Mage is my own little shout-out to the industry,” she said. As she wrote in the caption of her Instagram post: “Who’s their [Squalo & Mage] favorite singer? Of course it’s @garyvalenciano!” Squalo & Mage vs The Rage of the Bakunawa follows Mage and her best friend, Squalo the shark, who set out across Mundo to fulfill her late father’s last wish: to find the Bakunawa, the legendary precolonial serpent of the sea. What begins as a journey of hope turns dangerous when they discover that the serpent, once a protective guardian, has turned violent — wrecking ships and conjuring storms. As they’re hunted by Ventrolio, the Nightmare Maker, and his army of creatures, Mage and Squalo go on an adventure to uncover the truth behind the Bakunawa’s fury before it destroys their world. The book will be released in hardcover and paperback starting May 26, 2026, and is now available for pre-order on HarperCollins Publishers. Details on local pre-orders in the Philippines are yet to be announced. Beyond her graphic novel debut, Kara also illustrated her first picture book, BIGGER THAN ME, written by Erica Simone Turnipseed — and continues to champion musicians through Mirrorball Asia, which handles marketing services for various artists across Southeast Asia and beyond. – Jaella Magno/Rappler.com Jaella Magno is a Rappler intern studying AB Literature major in Creative Writing at De La Salle University.",True,true,How Kara Bodegón-Hikino turned her love for music into a graphic novel on Filipino folklore,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/literature/kara-bodegon-hikino-graphic-novel-filipino-folklore/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – The Ty family’s GT Capital Holdings Incorporated is teaming up with Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) to build the school’s newest campus in Cavite by 2030. ADMU and GT Capital on Friday, October 24, inked a memorandum of agreement to establish a new ADMU campus in Riverpark, a township development in General Trias City, Cavite owned by GT Capital’s Federal Land. GT Capital’s vice chair Alfred Ty said the Jesuit university’s presence in Riverpark will strengthen Cavite’s educational landscape. “Our investment in this campus reflects our long-term commitment to creating sustainable value for generations of Filipinos, anchored on the values of excellence and service,” he said. ADMU president Roberto Yap said the new campus will allow them to bring Jesuit education closer to learners and families in Cavite and its neighboring provinces. “This expansion reaffirms Ateneo’s enduring commitment to be a force for good — forming persons who are not only competent but also compassionate, ready to lead and serve in a rapidly changing world,” he said. A post shared by Riverpark (@riverparkph) Envisioned as the “next-gen city of the south,” Riverpark is also welcoming other developments such as SM City General Trias and Uniqlo’s logistics facility. Residents of the property are also expected to directly access the open canal interchange of the Cavite-Laguna Expressway by 2026. Federal Land and its Japanese joint venture partner Nomura Real Estate Development earlier reported that they fully sold out all of its commercial lots in Riverpark North. – Rappler.com",True,true,GT Capital to establish new Ateneo campus in Cavite by 2030,https://www.rappler.com/business/gt-capital-establish-new-ateneo-de-manila-campus-cavite-2030/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – A handful of ground beef vigorously shaped and molded into a sausage-like ball, dropped into an open-flame grill in front of you. The smoky heat emanates as you watch the patty cook until just medium. Then, a hunk of char-grilled beef is set atop a steaming bowl of warm Japanese rice in front of you. That’s all there is to it. But why are the lines so long and the clamor so consistent for this authentic on-the-rice hamburg experience? Beloved in Japan and around the world, the love for hamburg is growing in the Philippines. But more than the thrill of chowing down beef, rice, and condiments in one sitting, each component is treated specially and plays a role in this signature Japanese delicacy. It all begins with the quality and blend of the beef. The latest hamburg concept in the country, Hikiniku To Come Philippines, believes that one component cannot exist without the other, but each one must rightfully stand on its own. Brought in and conceptualized by The Standard Group (Yabu, Ippudo Ramen, Kiwami), the idea was inspired by the Concepcion family’s travels in Japan. They wanted something upscale but interactive, fit for the solo diner just like in Japan, but with tables long enough for groups of friends. “For the Philippine franchise, we have a special blend of beef imported from Japan,” Nicole Concepcion told Rappler. It includes imported choice-cut beef and wagyu. “It’s different per country,” she said, explaining how each branch adjusts depending on local suppliers and what best suits the market. Each hamburger is freshly ground daily, and the shaping and grilling happen right in front of every guest. Using authentic binchotan charcoal from Japan over a high-heat grill, the staff sears the meat until the coating is crisp with smoky grill marks, while the inside stays soft, juicy, and moist. The staff then places each patty on your own personal grill, keeping the meat warm, or allowing you to cook it further if you prefer. The beef packs a deep, savory, yet clean flavor; not oily or greasy. It actually feels light — not heavy on the stomach — which is proof that there are no extenders, fillers, or artificial flavorings used; just pure, quality beef. It’s simple in concept — beef and rice. But as Filipinos, we know exactly how a perfect bowl of rice can make or break a dish. At Hikiniku To Come, the Japanese rice is soaked first in specially softened water and sake, giving the grains a softer texture and an appetizing shine. It is then cooked in a high-pressure Hagama pot until fluffy, soft, and fragrant. The key is that no stale rice is served — batches are only served within 20 minutes of cooking. Any rice left beyond that is discarded to maintain quality. “We know it’s meticulous, but this ensures that every service reflects the Japanese precision and respect for their craft,” Concepcion said. The rice here calls for refills — it’s light, fluffy, and slightly chewy, just like good Japanese rice. The Hikiniku To Come set costs P850 and includes unlimited rice refills, condiments, and three burger patties. It might sound expensive, but three patties are more than enough to fill you up, especially with the free-flowing rice and the complimentary raw egg. Each patty is served at your own pace and upon request, though the turnaround time in the restaurant is pretty quick. According to the team, your first bite should be just beef and rice; it’s key to let the natural juices of the meat on top seep through the rice for a full bite. Purists won’t need much, but the condiments and sauces can add some oomph. The grated radish and ponzu sauce are meant for your second patty; a refreshing break from the savoriness of the first round. Drizzle the ponzu (a citrus-based soy sauce) and add a dollop of grated radish on top of the meat for a palate cleanser. The Hikiniku Sauce — a miso-based, umami-forward blend — adds richness if you want more punch. The naturally brewed soy sauce also pairs well with the grated radish and raw egg. The third piece is for you to go all out. All condiments are made in-house and are available for free at the table. The idea is to offer a variety of flavor profiles — salty, sour, sweet, spicy — so the beef can be enjoyed three times. The Lemon Salt is a refreshing salted lemon paste with a tinge of green-chili heat; the Oil-Marinated Green Chili is fresh, herby and salty; the Mou’s Xinjiang Spice Mix is an aromatic red chili blend with Chinese-forward spices and a kick; the Japanese Pepper Sauce has sansho (Japanese pepper), spring onion, ginger, and sesame oil for an Asian-inspired, nutty flavor; and the Garlic Flakes and Soy Sauce Flakes are reliable, umami-forward toppings. On the side, you’ll also get Chinese cabbage pickled in plum vinegar, a crisp and brightly sour palate cleanser between bites. There’s also a raw egg stand for your last bowl. Eggs are sanitized, delivered fresh daily, and stored in a controlled environment for food safety. Mixed into your rice or beef, it adds a creaminess that the Japanese love, especially when paired with soy sauce flakes and garlic flakes. Highballs, beers, and ginger ale are available, along with sides like potato salad and kimchi. Service is attentive, not just to guests but to the tiny details that define Japanese cuisine. “Every patty that breaks or overcooks is thrown away. It’s a strict standard that we embody due to Japanese discipline,” Concepcion said. The Philippine team underwent two months of intensive training in Japan, guided by Hikiniku’s Japanese chefs. Eight Japanese chefs are currently based in the Philippines to oversee continuous hands-on training. The space at Uptown Mall, Bonifacio Global City, transports you to Japan: minimalist interiors, clean lines, warm wood, and natural textures. A custom-engineered exhaust system helps to minimize the smoke in the dining area, so you don’t walk out smelling like beef and charcoal. Inside, though, the aroma of binchotan adds to the immersive experience. Hikiniku To Come is dedicated to preserving the authentic Hamburg experience, but there’s more than enough interactivity and customization to make the Philippine outpost feel unique and personal. – Rappler.com",True,true,Japan’s hamburg experience: It’s all in the beef and rice,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/hikiniku-to-come-bonifacio-global-city-hamburg-experience/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Let’s get the facts out of the way first. The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) did not lose P1.7 trillion in market capitalization. That number came from Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Francis Lim, who suggested that fleeing investors had wiped out that much in just three weeks because of the flood control corruption scandal. Shocking — but not true. Lim has since retracted the statement and apologized, saying he relied on what he believed was a credible report, which turned out to be “fictitious.” It’s a painfully ironic mistake for the country’s market watchdog, warning of “weak integrity” in the system while falling for fake data himself. Malacañang’s investment czar Frederick Go quickly corrected this, saying Lim was “quoting off a confirmed fake news post designed to catch attention and falsely sensationalize.” The real figure, according to PSE president Ramon Monzon, was far smaller. “PSE data shows that only P185 billion in market capitalization was lost during the three-week period in question,” he said. Setting aside the deeply unsettling fact that even the SEC chief is susceptible to fake news, Lim’s point still stands: the Philippine stock market is weak and confidence remains shaky. Corruption can indeed be, as he put it, a “weapon of mass wealth destruction.” [Closer Look] SEC chair error shows how we fall prey to disinformation Even PSE president Ramon Monzon agreed, saying, “SEC Chairman Francis Lim is correct in assailing the level of corruption in the country and its adverse effects on the economy and financial markets.” Rappler had also earlier pointed out how the flood control scandal and the broader corruption narrative could weigh on foreign investments, both in the markets and beyond. The PSE index (PSEi) has been struggling in recent weeks. From 6,264 in mid-September, it slipped to around 6,057 by October 9, briefly falling below the 6,000 level that traders see as a psychological floor. The drop has been broad but holding firms have been hit the hardest since they are heavily represented in the index. “When the overall economic outlook dims due to governance concerns, these conglomerates tend to bear the brunt,” Jarrod Tin, equity research analyst at DragonFi, told Rappler on Thursday, October 9. “Property, REITs, and banks are also weak — but mostly in response to BSP’s interest rate path rather than political noise.” There’s never one clear answer to what causes market volatility. That said, it’s important to put the market sell-off in perspective. Analysts note that the weakness in the PSEi isn’t driven by corruption alone. “It’s a mix of all factors,” Tin said. “With corruption as a persistent negative backdrop, different types of investors are losing confidence in the Philippines and expressing it by selling local equities.” Remember, the PSE is largely driven by foreign investors. Year-to-date, about 47% of all transactions in the PSE were foreign, and they’ve already sold about P43.8 billion more shares than they’ve bought. “Continued net foreign selling underscores that foreign investors remain cautious and are still offloading Philippine shares,” Tin said. In simple terms, more money is leaving rather than entering. When foreign funds exit, local institutions usually follow. One reason why is because foreign players dominate large, index-moving stocks that set the tone for the market. The result: a sell-off. But this retreat didn’t start with the flood control scandal. Investor confidence had already been under pressure from several fronts, such as tighter rules on online gambling, the Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGO) saga, and lingering red tape. Add to that the continued tensions in the Middle East, the threat and reality of a US government shutdown, and uncertainties of how tariffs will affect global markets, and it’s clear that sentiment was already fragile before corruption further burdened the attractiveness of the Philippine market. Markets run on perception, and right now, investors simply aren’t feeling optimistic about the Philippines. “Many investors have shifted to fixed-income assets like bonds and money market funds. Meanwhile, riskier assets such as crypto continue to outperform, and the US market enjoys strong momentum from the AI boom. Even several local influencers once focused on Philippine stocks have pivoted toward global stocks and crypto content,” Tin told Rappler. In the short term, it’s been a rough stretch for anyone with local equity exposure. If you hold an index-tracking fund, chances are you’re in the red. The PSEi has offered little room for outperformance, especially when stacked against the S&P 500, which has recently kept setting new record highs. Take a simple one-year comparison. Excluding dividends and fees, and taking prices as of October 8, the PSEi’s return over the past 12 months is about –19%. That means if you had invested P100,000 in a PSEi-tracking fund in October 2024, your investment would now be worth just around P81,000.Now look at the S&P 500, which has climbed 17% over the same period. That same P100,000 invested in a US index fund would have grown to roughly P117,000.When you put those numbers side by side, it becomes quite clear why investors would rather put their money in other markets or asset classes. Tin said the local index has become “a poor benchmark for alpha generation,” adding that investors looking for better upside may find it in thematic or sector-based strategies beyond the main index. Still, not everything is doom and gloom. Despite the bearish environment, it doesn’t necessarily mean that Philippine companies are bad. Rather, it’s a reflection of market sentiment. “The current market weakness is driven largely by fear and sentiment,” Tin told Rappler. “Stripping away the corruption narrative, most Philippine companies continue to post solid fundamentals and are expected to sustain earnings growth in the near term.” Even strong companies can look undervalued when investors are pulling out. Prices fall not necessarily because performance is poor, but because capital is leaving. That’s part of why conglomerates like SM and Megaworld have launched share buyback programs worth billions of pesos, signalling that they believe the market is undervaluing their companies. Tin said the pessimism may already be overdone. “If corruption issues have already peaked, conditions could improve from here,” he said. A rebound to around the 6,500 level by year-end is possible, especially if the upcoming third-quarter earnings season delivers solid results. “Investors should look beyond the noise and focus on fundamentals, the DragonFi analyst said. “There remain many undervalued dividend-paying opportunities in the market.” – Rappler.com Finterest is Rappler’s series that demystifies the world of money and gives practical advice on managing your personal finances.",True,true,"[Finterest] PSE may not have lost P1.7-T, but its weakness is still a problem",https://www.rappler.com/business/finterest-why-philippine-stock-exchange-weak-october-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – When two beloved homegrown brands meet for the first time, you know it’s going to be good. It’s the best of both croissant and ice cream worlds for The Best of Rebel, the first collaboration of Carmen’s Best and Rebel Bakehouse together, available starting September until December. Aside from collabs with Yardstick and Del Union, this is the first time Rebel Bakehouse is partnering with a local ice cream brand. As for Carmen’s Best, this is its first partnership with another local business. “There’s no better joy than giving your best,” said Joey Vergel de Dios, Carmen’s Best retail head, echoing Carmen’s Best brand motto. “We chose Rebel since we see them as a brand that upholds the same values as us in championing local gourmet food. It’s Carmen’s Best’s first collaboration with a brand,” she said. According to Carmen’s Best, the collab just made “perfect sense” and was the easiest “yes” for both brands, since they both pride themselves on using only fresh ingredients, supporting local communities for sourcing, and producing not at scale. Carmen’s Best uses 100% fresh milk from local farmers and makes everything from scratch — from its salted caramel to its cheese and strawberry ice cream bases; no extenders, no preservatives. Even the café’s sundae bowls, waffle cups, and chocolate syrup are homemade. “Everything here is no shortcuts,” they told Rappler, as with Rebel, which bakes its famous pastries every day from scratch. How did they decide which creations to come up with? “For Carmen’s Best, it was pretty straightforward,” Vergel de Dios said. “We thought of the traditional ways that people enjoy ice cream — as an ice cream sandwich, à la mode, and in a cone. But with Rebel, we elevated it using their pastries.” The Best of Rebel features three limited-edition items, starting with the Cookie à la Mode (P260), which is Rebel’s chewy chocolate chip cookie topped with Carmen’s Best milky soft serve (which is only available in their cafés). This is the family-friendly choice of them all and apparently the best-seller because it’s the most familiar and easiest to eat. It’s hard to go wrong with a homemade, ooey-gooey chocolate chip cookie and ice cream on top, with a sprinkle of chocolate chips for added crunch. On the other hand, the Croissant Soft Serve (P250) is a novel way to enjoy Rebel’s croissant; it’s served cone-style, sugary, syrupy, and indulgently fun. Rebel’s honey butter cone holds up Carmen’s Best soft serve, with caramel drizzled on top. It’s got all the textures you need — crunchy, flaky, and crumbly in the best way, with caramelized sweetness in every bite, mellowed out by the milky soft-serve. Both desserts come with perhaps the best component of the series: Rebel’s new croissant cookie — crispy, delicate, buttery, and just the right mix of sticky and sweet. Carmen’s Best told Rappler they wanted to highlight one of their hidden gems — the soft serve. “We wanted a dessert that highlights our 100% fresh milk in its purest form,” Vergel de Dios said. “As compared to our ice cream, which also uses 100% fresh milk, the soft serve’s taste and texture focus on that.” Don’t skip on the Ice Cream Sandwich (P250), using Rebel’s famous freshly baked mini golden butter croissant that hugs scoops of Carmen’s Best’s equally famous Everyone Loves Vanilla ice cream (from the pint and not the soft serve). The ice cream inside is topped with more caramel and nuts for crunch. The consistency of the ice cream here is thicker and creamier, and it’s more vanilla than milk (the soft serve is milkier, so if you like milk, go for that). If you’re a sucker for hot-and-cold desserts too, this will satisfy — the soft, buttery, and warmed croissant paired with the ice cream makes for a comforting and filling treat; the added crunch of real nuts and a touch of caramel sweetness make it even more decadent (without feeling overwhelming). You can also choose your own flavors of ice cream to put in the middle — from classic to premium — for an additional price. But Carmen’s Best recommends the pure vanilla so as not to distract from the goodness of Rebel’s croissant. Just a month of R&D went into the collab, with both teams actively present in the conceptualization process. “We also had limitations — it’s not like we’re going to cook or bake, so it had to be something simple that you can pair with ice cream,” Vergel de Dios said. “If Rebel already had the cone or the cookie, it was just easy to put our own ice cream. It made sense.” They also didn’t want to make it too complicated. “If we made it too DIY, people would get overwhelmed,” she explained. “We wanted it to stay simple, familiar, and indulgent.” The three items are available at Carmen’s Best Rockwell branch until the end of the year. Currently, Rebel Bakehouse Podium has the Croissant Cone and Cookie à la Mode, while Rebel Bakehouse Glorietta has the Croissant Soft Serve, Cookie à la Mode, plus an exclusive affogato item made with Rebel’s coffee and Carmen’s Best soft serve. Founded in 2011 by Paco Magsaysay, Carmen’s Best began as a small family business using excess fresh milk from their father’s dairy farm in Laguna. Named after Paco’s daughter, the homegrown ice cream brand quickly gained popularity for its rich, creamy texture, gourmet branding, and refined flavors made with 100% fresh milk, pure cream, and no shortcuts. Rebel Bakehouse started in Baguio City in 2022 as a commissary-café known for its buttery croissants and inventive pastries. Founded by Donna Aldana and Danica Santos, Rebel Bakehouse also gained a cult following for its fresh, flaky pastries daily, using premium ingredients and traditional French techniques. They have since expanded to Metro Manila. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Carmen’s Best, Rebel Bakehouse team up for croissant-ice cream creations",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/carmens-best-rebel-bakehouse-collab-croissant-ice-cream/,Rappler
"NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – Silay City in Negros Occidental is known for valuing its history, arts, tourism, and cultural heritage. Dubbed the “Little Paris of Negros Occidental,” Silay is more than just the home of the world-renowned Balay Negrense – the mansions of sugar barons built between 1897 and 1901. The city is also famous for its heirloom recipes with distinctive flavors that set it apart from other places in Negros Occidental. Silay’s lechon baboy (roasted pig) by Emma Roa is a sought-after dish for special occasions even among wealthy Negrense families. For decades, the Roa family has maintained the tenderness and flavor of their lechon, making it consistently regarded as the “best in town.” The recipe, however, remains a closely guarded secret to this day. Renowned for its signature wafer-thin, crispy skin, Emma Roa’s lechon is also celebrated for its flavorful meat, infused with secret local herbs that add an aromatic, unforgettable taste. Nanay Rosalinda Belleza’s fresh lumpia is another standout, delighting locals and visitors for more than three decades. Made with ubod (heart of palm), ground pork, shrimp, and other vegetables, a trip to Silay wouldn’t be complete without tasting or taking home Nanay Rosalinda’s fresh lumpia. This one stands out for its use of fresh ingredients, delivering natural nutrients and vibrant flavors. The homemade crepe-like wrappers are delicate yet sturdy, perfectly complementing the filling. The dish is further elevated by a signature savory sauce, highlighted by the harmonious balance of salty and sweet peanuts. Above all, each lumpia is made “with love,” a personal touch that keeps patrons coming back. The Gaston family’s Adobong Milyonaryong Baboy is another culinary gem. Its flavor is completely distinct from other adobong baboy (braised pork) across the country. Specialized by Monsignor GG Gaston, this adobong milyonaryo is known for its generous use of garlic, producing a rich, unforgettable flavor that delights every palate. For over five decades, dishes like German Unson’s diablo (spicy chicken relleno), pato sa tuba (duck in coconut wine), and chorizo pudpod (shredded chorizo) have been carefully preserved, reflecting the city’s dedication to culinary heritage. For those who crave “heat,” Diablo delivers. A substantial amount of pepper perfectly complements the chicken, offering a spicy yet delicious kick that keeps diners coming back for more. All these contribute to Silay’s excellence in food tourism. These heirloom recipes, however, risk being forgotten amid the shifting interests of younger generations toward viral online food trends. Gerle Sulmaca, Silay’s tourism officer, told Rappler, “We really need to move forward to preserve our heirloom recipes.” This month’s edition of Kaon ‘Ta (Let’s Eat), Silay’s annual food fair, reflected that intention: to attract young people, especially younger members of the families behind these dishes, to take responsibility for preserving their culinary heritage. The city government said it remains committed to showcasing these heirloom recipes at events nationwide and abroad. When Kaon ‘Ta was conceptualized in 2016, the aim was simply to showcase the city’s proud culinary heritage to the public. Held on the grounds of the Balay Negrense on Cinco de Noviembre Street, Barangay III-Poblacion, the food fair has become an integral part of the city’s annual Al Cinco de Noviembre celebration. The event commemorates the bloodless revolution in Negros Occidental in 1898 – every November 5, as well as the patronal fiesta in honor of Silay’s patron saint, San Diego de Alcala, from November 1 to 13. “Food heritage is our asset. It defines our identity as Silaynons. We will preserve it no matter what,” Sulmaca assured. Chel Jimenez, granddaughter of the late German and Fe Ledesma-Unson, said she is committed to preserving her grandparents’ recipes. For her, these dishes – created over 50 years ago – are more than family heirlooms; they are a legacy to be cherished beyond pride. She promised to maintain this culinary heritage despite challenging times. – Rappler.com",True,true,Silay’s heirloom recipes: Preserving culinary heritage for the next generation,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/silay-city-negros-occidental-heirloom-recipes-culinary-heritage/,Rappler
"ALBAY, Philippines – Charged with deep and searing dialogue that exposes the painful experiences of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV), Albay theater group Sining Banwa relentlessly confronts the prejudice and dangerous misconception against HIV in a time when new transmissions continue to surge in Bicol. Drawing from real cases and local community inspiration, Sining Banwa staged Gymgurls, too, a sequel to their most rerun advocacy play, Gymgurls. The new production catches up with the original characters — Sherry, Max, Noel, Teri, and JK — and introduces Alex, 10 years after their first encounter at the gym for PLHIV. Gymgurls originally premiered in 2015, the same year Richard Hayag, the president and founder of Gentlemen Bicol, tested positive for HIV. This shared experience forged a partnership between Gentlemen Bicol and Sining Banwa, allowing them to work hand-in-hand to raise awareness about HIV in the region. (READ: Must-watch Bicol plays of Tanghal Lusong 2025: Narratives that reflect, reconnect) Hayag’s own struggles resonated deeply with most of what the play discussed. He earlier told Rappler, “The fear I felt came from my surroundings. I knew that back in 2015, the community wasn’t as open about HIV. My biggest enemy wasn’t the virus itself — it was the judgment and disgust directed at me.” Ten years later, Gymgurls, too shows that these prejudices still loom large over Bicol, forming a renewed multi-sectoral partnership with the urgent mandate to confront them. This need is underscored by a new report from the Department of Health-Bicol, revealing that 79% of new HIV cases in the region from January to April 2025 were among younger people: 37% were aged 15-24 and 42% were from the 25-34 age group. Senior artist Julie DM Bega reprises her role from the original cast as Sherry, a PLHIV who has become a counselor in the sequel. Through Sherry’s experience, the play reveals that the struggle is not limited to acquiring HIV, but extends to the community volunteers who provide treatment and counseling. “My entire life, I was a volunteer here at the gym, I taught in forums, I never tired of going to the communities to educate — I gave my all. But when I was close to death, who was there to help me? Life went on for so many, but I had to eat alone, and sleep alone,” Sherry said. The play mirrors the reality that while doing community work, Sherry became a victim of harassment and physical threats from people who discriminate against HIV community workers. This reflects the real experiences of many volunteers who feel alone and unsupported while continuing their advocacy. “I’ve done so much, I’ve contributed so much, but why do I always feel like I’m alone, like I have no one on my side,” she added. Aside from local prejudice, local volunteers now face a severe struggle with minimal local support and a declining global fund for HIV response, driven primarily by United States budget cuts. “In January, the US Government paused all foreign assistance. The sudden pause had an immediate impact on the delivery of life-saving HIV medicines and the provision of HIV prevention services to millions of people whose lives depend on them,” Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)’s report stated. This massive cut heavily impacts local non-governmental organizations, such as Gentlemen Bicol, which, according to UNAIDS Philippines country director Dr. Louie Ocampo, has a crucial role in advancing global HIV targets. (READ:Beyond numbers: How stigma impedes HIV testing in Albay) “Local NGOs and community-led organizations, especially those led by key populations, play an essential role in advancing the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets. Many of these groups operate and manage community centers, often supported by donors who provide resources for service delivery and operational support.” Ocampo explained. Before and after the show, audiences can receive free and confidential HIV testing, as well as condoms, other sexual health protection supplies, and take-home self-testing kits with a full orientation on how to use them. The issue of HIV is part of a larger mandate for Sining Banwa, which also stages global narratives to address heavily stigmatized issues across the country, not just in Bicol. Allysah Mariel Hugo, a resident artist with Sining Banwa, believes this theater initiative has the power to reflect and retell the stories of people in marginalized sectors. She argues that artists must now more than ever unite to create critical discourse on social narratives that the community must collectively change. “As we face the repercussions of the systemic problems, it is high time for us to step up and create spaces at the heart of communities where theater artists and the audience can safely explore, discuss, develop and put into action their visions and aspirations,” she continued. Aside from Gymgurls, too, Sining Banwa continues to stage various shows that use local narratives to call attention to critical issues. Their current lineup includes PedXing VIII, which features three fresh sets of stories, and upcoming re-runs of Higit sa Pag-Ibig: The Musical and this year’s Guiromdom project, which honors the theater group’s past works. – Rappler.com",True,true,"How Albay theater group stages struggles of Filipinos with HIV in ‘Gymgurls, too’",https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/theater/albay-theater-group-stages-struggles-filipinos-hiv-gymgurls-too/,Rappler
"Why do people move to Boracay? Apart from the obvious sand, sea, and sun, well, there’s the wind, too. Kit is a tech nomad, and after the COVID lockdown was lifted, he asked himself, “What am I doing in Manila when I can be doing the same thing in Boracay and enjoying my true love — kitesurfing!” There’s also Will, who just turned 50 and was Manila-weary. Being the only unmarried one in their group, he decided to “take one for the team” and go down to the island to manage the café and hotel renovations for CaféGotSoul Boracay (not to be confused with CafeGotSoul Montreal and CafeGotSoul MNL in BGC). Dian, a native Cebuana, took a job on the island (Willy’s) much to the disapproval of her friends. This was the start of her career on the island leading up to her management role in Levantin in Bulabog beach. And then, there’s love. There’s Julia and her seashell eyes. Swedish-born Julia volunteered to work in one of Mother Teresa’s hospitals in India and traveled around the continent and zeroed in on Boracay. There must have been a strong pull to meet her destiny. This was in 1989. She met her husband and has two children who have chosen to live on the island. She cuts a tall striking figure, taking early morning walks with her dog along the trails of Mt. Luho, riding around on her bike to oversee her businesses, the Lemon Café in D’Mall, the Dinibeach Bar and Restaurant, and the Diniview Resort where she lives, high up on the hill with a full view of the sunset. “Everyone walks around the island, which is very Blue Zone. It’s very natural for us to move around,” she says. “We have access to fresh fish and vegetables. Another Blue Zone check mark. Sourcing your food as close to the source as possible. We don’t serve steaks for example. Not to mention the crisp clean air one can enjoy.” Blue Zones, according to Healthline, are “geographic areas with lower rates of chronic diseases and longer life expectancy. Diet, fasting, and exercise are factors associated with Blue Zones.” There’s a strong sense of community in Boracay. Again, very Blue Zone. Will enjoys walking across the road to work, and one can feel a real caring relationship with the staff as he shows off the healthy coat of a rescue dog they saved in front of the café a few months ago. While shooting the breeze with Dian in front of Levantin, a foreigner jogs by. Dian says he jogs 18 kilometers a day. There’s also an 82-year-old Japanese kitesurfer, a permanent resident in Bulabog, making his way to the Freestyle Academy Kitesurfing School. “Such is island life,” says Dian, whose house is a five-minute walk from her office in Levantin. Living on an island, though, comes with its own challenges. The trauma of the COVID lockdown, for instance, seems fresh in the memory of the island residents. While they had zero cases, many businesses had to close down from the obvious drop in tourists. Some managed to open again. Some not. Add to the previous “clean up” during the Duterte administration in 2018 and a devastating typhoon in 2019, COVID was the last element for a perfect storm. During the COVID lockdown, the island had 40 suicide cases. One hotel staff said they all started fishing just to get an income, but they cannot all be fishing. One of the lucky ones retained by the hotels that could still operate also said he had to learn to do all the jobs — security, cook, cleaner, et cetera, since they were working in shifts. While Julia and other businesses tried to keep their staff, they could not. So, they got together and shared them among themselves, Jony’s, The Lazy Dog, and her own Lemon Café. Julia is also the president of Friends of the Flying Foxes (FFF). First established in 2002, this group of volunteers, wildlife specialists, and returning visitors understand the value of the fruit bats (flying foxes) and diligently monitor activities that may harm the ecosystem. The bats are vital to health of the forest and are responsible for 90% of the island’s reforestation. FFF has been conducting monthly bat counts since 2002. Bat numbers have diminished because of illegal hunting activities and the bulldozers that keep appearing despite petitions from the stakeholders to stop developments that conduct illegal activities such as cutting trees without the necessary permits and disturbing bat roosts. They also conduct extensive information and education campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of the bats. FFF is not anti-development; but supports development with the necessary environmental protection regulations implemented and monitored. As Boracay thrives on tourism, Julia and many other residents make sure to keep watch of the degradation of its natural beauty. Julia says, “We are so lucky to settle down on this beautiful island, the place we are so blessed to call home.” “The spirit and kindness of the island people and our community in itself, make us all push through, no matter what, and that’s what always keeps us going,” she adds. “The care of the island, its environment, people and animals are always a top priority for us and we try to practice what we preach, and hope you feel that in our places.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Why some still move to ‘Blue Zone’ Boracay,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/why-some-still-move-blue-zone-boracay/,Rappler
"TOKYO, Japan – The original bag custom-made for late actress Jane Birkin which became a design icon was revealed to media in Tokyo on Wednesday by the Japanese company that purchased it for a record 8.6 million euros ($10 million) at Sotheby’s in Paris earlier this year. According to fashion lore, the first Birkin bag was conceived when the Franco-British actress and singer sat next to Hermes executive Jean-Louis Dumas on a flight in 1984 and told him she needed a stylish-yet-functional bag as a young mother. Dumas immediately sketched out the rectangular handbag, with a dedicated space for baby bottles. After Birkin got her custom-made bag, the company went on to manufacture smaller versions for the mass-market, turning it into an instant hit and helping fuel the fashion brand’s expansion. Shinsuke Sakimoto, co-founder and CEO of second-hand luxury goods reseller Valuence Japan, which purchased the Birkin, said the story of the handbag’s inception represented the company’s philosophy. “We believe that products should not be spoken about in terms of price, but rather through the stories that include the brand’s philosophy and values; in other words, they should be spoken about in terms of their significance.” Valuence plans to display its prized purchase in museums and similar venues rather than resell it, he said. Birkin herself auctioned the bag in 1994 to support Sidaction, a French charity that raises funds to fight AIDS.

"Strong AI demand helped power Alphabet’s financial results, as both the core advertising and cloud computing businesses of the Google parent beat revenue expectations. Despite whispers of concerns over a developing AI bubble, the search giant boosted its projected capital expenditures for the year to between $91 billion and $93 billion. “We are investing to meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities across the company,” CEO Sundar Pichai said in Alphabet’s earnings release. Alphabet, which spent $52.5 billion in 2024, had already shocked Wall Street twice this year with its aggressive spending ambitions, first declaring a $75 billion outlay in February, and then boosting the projection to $85 billion in July. Shares of the company rose 6% in extended trading. The company reported total revenue of $102.35 billion for the quarter, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $99.89 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Adjusted profit per share of $3.10 beat estimates of $2.26. Google Cloud’s 34% revenue growth helped it to remain as one of Alphabet’s fastest-growing segments as it benefitted from surging enterprise demand for AI-powered infrastructure and data analytics services. The unit posted revenue of $15.16 billion, topping estimates of $14.72 billion. The performance was boosted by burgeoning enterprise demand for its AI infrastructure, even as returns for businesses adopting the technology remain uncertain. That is evidenced by Google Cloud’s backlog of non-recognized sales contracts, which grew to $155 billion, according to Pichai. In July, Alphabet said the backlog had reached $106 billion. The unit continues to close the gap with larger rivals Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, aided by strong take-up of Vertex AI and its custom AI chips called Tensor Processing Units. Competition in the broader AI and cloud market is intensifying, with rivals aggressively cutting prices and introducing new generative-AI capabilities. Revenue from Google’s advertising business rose 12.6% to $74.18 billion, well above estimates of $71.79 billion, allaying fears of some investors and indicating that the digital ad market has remained robust in the face of economic uncertainty and intense competition. Alphabet’s advertising unit, which contributes the vast majority of the company’s revenue, has been competing in a crowded field of rivals vying for more ad dollars as lower interest rates are expected to lift the economy. “Continued strength in search is helping to dispel the negative sentiment surrounding AI’s potential impact on Google’s biggest businesses,” said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager at shareholder Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. However, analysts have pointed to cautious spending from advertisers in some sectors grappling with economic uncertainty due to pressures from tariff costs and a rapidly evolving global trading landscape. Still, Wall Street expects the company to benefit from advertisers moving away from experimental ad platforms like Snapchat and others. Last week, Microsoft and SoftBank Group-backed OpenAI unveiled Atlas, an AI-powered browser aimed at directly competing with Google’s core search engine and browser stack. The launch, as Reuters earlier reported, represents one of the most significant challenges to Google’s search dominance in years and will be a key focus for investors listening for management’s response to the rising competitive threat to its most lucrative business. Still, while the ChatGPT maker and other startups like Anthropic and Perplexity are introducing new AI-powered apps to consumers, Google’s search market share appears to be steadying. “AI Overviews and AI Mode are clearly resonating with users, helping to ease fears that Google’s core search business is under threat from generative AI,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Alphabet reported that its number of employees stood at roughly 190,000 at the end of September, up by more than 8,000 from the same period last year. Its rival Amazon said it will lay off 14,000 workers on Tuesday. – Rappler.com",True,true,"Alphabet hikes capex again after earnings beat on strong ad, cloud demand",https://www.rappler.com/technology/alphabet-earnings-release-october-2025/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Water concessionaire Maynilad made its stock market debut on Friday, November 7, in the largest public offering since food and beverage firm Monde Nissin in 2021. The water concessionaire chaired by tycoon Manny Pangilinan is now listed at the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) under the ticker symbol “MYNLD” and made its initial public offering (IPO) of 1.6 billion primary common shares priced at P15 apiece. Around 24.9 million million shares were also allocated to First Pacific Company Limited to maintain its current shareholding. The offer was 2.7 times oversubscribed, which happens when demand for a stock is greater than the number of available shares. The IPO also attracted 12 cornerstone investors such as the Asian Development Bank, the International Finance Corporation, and the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Cornerstone investors are large, reputable institutional investors that purchase a predetermined amount of shares in an IPO before the public launch. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who led the bell-ringing ceremony for Maynilad’s public debut, hopes that Maynilad’s entry into the stock market will draw more investments into the local market. “Maynilad’s public listing signals what I have been telling the world: that the Philippines is open, ready, and eager to do business with you,” he said. Pangilinan said that the listing is more than just a fulfillment of provisions in Maynilad’s legislative franchise, but a commitment to efficiently deliver the essential services it offers. “This listing is not just about franchise compliance, nor is it just about capital raising. It is, above all, a commitment to continue delivering essential services, with integrity and excellence,” he said. Under Maynilad’s legislative franchise, the water concessionaire is required to go public by January 2027. (READ: Maynilad, Manila Water concession deals get 10-year extension) Maynilad’s president and chief executive officer Ramoncito Fernandez said the company will use the proceeds from the IPO to fund its capital expenditure (capex) requirements. “We have a very aggressive capex plan that has been approved by the regulators… So that will definitely help us in making our services improve via this capex plan,” Fernandez told reporters in a Friday briefing. Fernandez said low-hanging fruits for the company include offering wastewater and sanitation services to its commercial and industrial customers, as well as expanding its services to areas beyond its concession zone. In particular, Fernandez said Maynilad is looking to offer its services to local government units (LGUs) adjacent to the areas it currently serves. Maynilad serves around 95% of the 11 million population in the west zone of Greater Manila Area: City of Manila (certain portions), Quezon City (certain portions), Makati (west of South Super Highway), Caloocan, Pasay, Parañaque, Las Piñas, Muntinlupa, Valenzuela, Navotas and Malabon, all in Metro Manila; the cities of Cavite, Bacoor and Imus, and the municipalities of Kawit, Noveleta and Rosario, all in Cavite province. “There are still, specifically, the adjacent cities beside our borders, our boundaries, [want] our services. So that’s a possibility for us that we can offer to these LGUs that are wanting improved services, both in the boundaries in Bulacan and the boundaries in Cavite,” he explained. Maynilad closed its first trading day slightly lower at P14.98 per share. The PSE benchmark index retreated to the 5,700 level on Friday trade amid lower than expected economic growth data in the third quarter. – Rappler.com",True,true,Maynilad raises P34.3 billion from stock market debut,https://www.rappler.com/business/maynilad-ipo-stock-market-debut-november-2025/,Rappler
"“My Queen, you are the fairest of them all.” This was the answer of the magic mirror every time the reigning queen asked this iconic question in the romanticized children’s literature of the Brothers Grimm, and popularized by the Disney movie, Snow White. But, like in the said fairy tale, comes a chilling turn: a new beauty has come of age and emerged to challenge the beauty of the reigning queen. Lifting the plot of Snow White into our stock market story book, the contest for “who is the fairest one of all” is now drawn between two identical investment beauties — that of the reigning listed water utility company and of the new beauty that is soon to debut in the same trading board. The old beauty is Manila Water Company Incorporated (MWC) which was listed in March 2005. The new beauty is no other than Maynilad Water Services Incorporated whose initial public offering (IPO) went underway last October 23 and ended yesterday, October 29, 2025, with its listing date scheduled on November 7, 2025 on the main board of the bourse under the trading symbol of “MYNLD.” The public equity offering involved the sale of 1.935 billion primary common shares and 0.354 billion secondary common shares held by the selling shareholder, Maynilad Water Holding Company Incorporated, for a total of about 2.289 billion shares. Out of the total offered shares of 2.289 billion shares, 0.628 billion or to be more exact 628,656,600 shares, were allotted to meet overhang demand broken down as follows: preferential offer of 24,904,800 primary common shares, an overallotment option of up to 249,047,600 primary common shares, and an upsize option of up to 354,704,200 secondary common shares. At the offer price of P15 per share, the total amount of the public offering (inclusive of the demand overhang options) is equivalent to P34.335 billion — the largest for 2025. The public offering has attracted support from major institutional domestic and international investors with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as lead cornerstone investors. As of this writing, the upsize option for secondary shares was fully exercised by both financial institutions. The entry of cornerstone investors is a significant development: it serves as a solid vote of confidence that the investment is credible and viable; their presence also serves to ensure a more stable market performance for the issue as cornerstone investors typically agree to a lock-up period where they cannot sell their shares immediately. Not to mention, a stabilization fund is also ready to prop up MYNLD’s market performance upon listing. The net proceeds from the public offering will be used largely for capital expenditures requirements and to some extent for general corporate purposes of the company. MYNLD is the water and wastewater services provider for the West Zone of the greater Metro Manila area. This covers the cities of Manila excluding the districts of Santa Ana and San Andres, Caloocan, Las Piñas, Malabon, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Pasay, and Parañaque except barangay of San Martin de Porres. It also covers three cities of Cavite province particularly Cavite City, Bacoor, and Imus and the municipalities of Kawit, Noveleta, and Rosario. MYNLD is the largest water concessionaire by active connections not only in the Philippines but the whole of Southeast Asia. As of June 30, 2025, the West Zone has a covered area of 540 square kilometers (sq. km) with a population of approximately 10.5 million people. It has 1.56 million billed connections of domestic and non-domestic customers, covering 94.8% of the West Zone’s population. Its concession agreement was granted in 1997 and was recently extended up to January 2047. MWC services the East Zone covering 1,400 sq. km of land area, which includes 24 cities and municipalities in Metro Manila and the province of Rizal. Covered in its service area are parts of the cities of Makati, Manila, and Quezon City, and the entire of Mandaluyong, Marikina, and Pateros. In Rizal, the company serves the city of Antipolo and districts of San Mateo and Angono. It currently services about 7.8 million people with 1.11 million billed connections as of the end of June 2025. Its concession agreement was also recently extended up to January 2047. (READ: Public interest, private hands: How Manila Water, Maynilad got the deal) In 2024, MWC reported P36.6 billion in service revenues while MYNLD reported a slightly lower service revenues of P33.5 billion. Both companies experienced revenue growth driven by factors such as implemented tariff adjustments and recovery of consumption in their respective service areas. However, MYNLD yielded a greater net income of P12.78 billion compared to MWC’s P10.97 billion due to its lighter debt portfolio. MYNLD’s cost of debt is reported to be “50bps lower” compared to that of MWC. For the first half of 2025, MYNLD reported a total revenue of P18.35 billion while MWC reported a P19.99-billion total revenue based on a respective average tariff of P68.2 P/cu.m. and P80.4 P/cu.m. Earnings before interest charges, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA was P12.74 billion (69.0% margin) for MYNLD and P14.58 billion (73.0% margin) for MWC, ending with a respective net income (NI) of P7.47 billion and P7.96 billion. With the reported net income, MYNLD drew a return on equity (ROE) of 10.0% and 21.0% for MWC. Estimated earnings per share (EPS) for MYNLD is P1.33 and P1.48 for MWC. NRW for MYNLD is 35.3% and 14.4% for MWC. NRW stands for Non-Revenue Water: it’s the water that has been treated and produced but is not billed to customers. It also includes all water lost due to leaks, illegal connections, meter errors, and other forms of theft or unaccounted-for usage. Reducing NRW is crucial for water utilities; it helps improve financial performance, reduce water wastage, and increase efficiency. Market response to the issue is reportedly good — especially from institutional investors. It’s said to be two times (2x) oversubscribed. Demand from “local small investors” (LSI), however, is patently almost absent. This is how metaphoric was the reaction of stockbroker Rene de los Reyes of Abacus Securities Corporation of the Abacus Capital & Investment Corporation group when given the choice to select between the two beauties: “At P15.00 a piece, Maynilad would be trading at 8.8x EV/EBITDA (EV stands for Enterprise Value). Applying that to MWC, its price per should be P49.78. The upside is very good, so I load up on MWC, and ignored MYNLD.” After buying a load, he said again: “I read from another review that MYNLD has a superior dividend yield; it’s 6.4% vs. 5.4% in favor of MYNLD. So, I have to beg even for some shares.” But just then, he was hit again by another bothering news: MYNLD’s dividend yield was not explicitly promised, but a forward-looking impression. In this connection, De Los Reyes had this to say to investors: Don’t get affected by what you read or hear. Stay focused on your main reason why you are investing in the stock issue. In the end, though, he concedes that MYNLD is a good dividend investment play. Jofer Gaite, president and chief trader of Westlink Global Equities Incorporated, totally agrees that MYNLD is a dividend play, all aspects considered. This is also the conclusion of his friend and former colleague Julian Tarrobago who is now on his own as founder and CEO of From Red to Green Investments — describing as well MYNLD as a boring investment with its anticipated stable market performance owing to its non-erratic and predictable revenue stream and cashflow. Andro Leo I. Beltran, vice president, First Metro Sec of the Metrobank Group had this to say: Due to the plans and programs of MYNLD, it can be considered as a core stock in your investment portfolio for the medium to long term. Also, MYNLD has a more superior dividend play vis-à-vis MWC. If it comes to a choice between the two, one’s overall growth and risk objectives should be used as determining factors. For Joel de la Peña, market strategist and chief trader of H.E. Bennett Securities Incorporated, while he is also interested in the issue, he finds MYNLD worth buying at a lower price than its offer price of P15 per share. This is the reason why he is not personally subscribing at the moment because he thinks — like most IPOs in the last 10 years or so — they tank upon listing, with most of them unable to go back even in their IPO offer price. Joey Roxas, president of Eagle Equities Incorporated, also agrees that MYNLD is a “Buy” and prefers it against MWC with its demonstrated operating ability even amidst historical challenges, plus the possibility that it can acquire PrimeWater from Manny Villar. He also begs to disagree with De La Peña that MYNLD will tank upon listing, citing the successful price stabilization strategies employed by present underwriters. (Rappler Investigates: Woeful PrimeWater) Wishing to be identified only as “M” at the moment, he especially detailed the three salient points — most of the other traders also — think will make MYNLD a better investment than MWC: “First, MYNLD has a higher dividend payout very good for cash-flow seekers; second, MYNLD has a much healthier balance sheet as of 1H25 at 1.0x D/E (debt-to-equity ratio), which will further improve to 0.6x post-IPO, compared to MWC’s 1.5x D/E. This will allow MYNLD to fund their substantial 2025-2027 CAPEX budget of P112.0 billon, which will be critical for the 7th rate rebasing period. Third, MYNLD’s opening cash position (OCP) of PHP100.4 billion vis-à-vis MWC’s P27.6 billion will result in higher tariff adjustments for the subsequent rebasing periods. The OCP is subjected to a 12% nominal rate of return over the course of the concession period until it goes to P0.00.” “Conversely, MWC has higher-quality assets and customers. Despite the East Concession Zone (MYNLD) is housing 10.5 million customers vs the West Concession Zone’s (MWC) 7.7 million billed volume stands relatively the same at 273 MCM (Million Cubic Meters) and 262 MCM, respectively. Furthermore, MYNLD has a long road ahead to improve its pipe infrastructure with non-revenue water at 36.7%. They aim to bring this down 20% by 2030.” In line with this, ‘M’ thinks that “there is upside for MYNLD on the listing day and thereafter, targeting it closer to the PH10y (Philippines 10-year Government Bond Yield)of 5.9%. This represents an upside of more than 10%. USD risks are minimal with most of their loans denominated in Peso and Yen.” With the exception of De la Peña, ‘M’ shares the same sentiments what the rest of the traders believe: MYNLD will not tank upon listing, it will not also be a flyer, but it will be “Climber.” – Rappler.com (The article has been prepared for general circulation for the reading public and must not be construed as an offer, or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or financial instruments whether referred to herein or otherwise.

A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr Holmes and Mr Baer: I’m 33, navigating a new romantic relationship. We have been together for 4 months. My girlfriend (28) is the selosa (jealous) type. Her constantly misconstruing my words and actions are beginning to take its toll on me. I truly and deeply cherish my girlfriend. I don’t think anyone will contest that I have a good head on my shoulders. I have also been taught well on how to treat a lady. My lady, for that matter. No other female in my life holds a candle to the level of care and affection and effort I have put forth for my significant other, like daily phone calls for hours, picking her up for our outings, ferrying her home, sending her coffee on occasion, writing heartfelt letters to her for our milestones together, etc. So it hurts me so deeply and in a whole new level to hear from her how my intentions have been misinterpreted to the effect of painting me as being promiscuous, or someone who is not proud of her. She also fears that I may not even like her. This rattles me and I start to think that, “after all the things I do for her and my pakikitungo (respect) for her every wish, she STILL misinterprets my actions as animosity or “mere friendship.” There’s just so much going on that I feel I am constantly walking on eggs! I now watch every step I take. I have even unlearned things for the sake of her peace of mind. With the way things are perceived by her, I feel like I’m in a muted online meeting that I struggle to get my voice across to her. She’s not in any competition with anyone for my affection. Whereas am i competing with her intrusive thoughts? When i feel beaten and overwhelmed with all this, I can’t help feeling exhausted. I just blindly obey her, just to keep the peace. Despite this, she misinterprets my actions as “not being interested.” I desperately need a new perspective. How we can work on a stronger, emotionally secure connection so our relationship can move forward? Are men not allowed to have female friends? If she finds out I wrote to Two Pronged, she will accuse me of “airing our dirty laundry.” Am I breaking some unspoken rule about not sharing my relationship problems, even if I think it will help? Thank you very much for your time, Edwin Dear Edwin, As a general rule, couples tend to be on their best behavior during the early stages of their relationship. They are keen to showcase their best qualities and to minimize or even hide any negatives. As the relationship develops and an increasing degree of trust is established, then a clearer picture of their true characters may begin to emerge. Your relationship is now four months old and Anna’s character is already coming into focus. You describe her as jealous, controlling, misjudging you, misconstruing your words and actions. As a result, and to keep the relationship on an even keel, you have had to stifle your own opinions and simply go along with whatever she suggests. This raises multiple red flags. A relationship is supposed to be based on mutual respect and trust, not one party laying down the law and demanding that their narrative be accepted blindly. You have put in the hard yards, attempting to meet her needs and catering to her every whim. That has merely produced a situation you find intolerable, so now is the time to tell her both how you actually see your current role (slave) and how you ideally see that role (full partner). If she is willing to hear you out, then there is still hope for the relationship, despite the problems so far. If, however, she merely gets defensive and is unwilling to modify her behavior, then it is doomed and you would be advised to move on. All the best, JAFBaer Dear Edwin, Thank you so much for writing us. Please don’t be disappointed with my not answering your question: “How we can work on a stronger, emotionally secure connection so our relationship can move forward?” Don’t get me wrong. It’s a wonderfully positive question, but it is not realistic when it comes to your current girlfriend. She will never be satisfied. Her lack of contentment and her anger are what keeps you where she wants you: feeling you’re “in a muted online meeting struggling to get your voice across, constantly walking on eggs… beaten, overwhelmed, exhausted so that you blindly obey her just to keep the peace!” No wonder you feel unheard and unseen! Let’s be positive and conclude that she is merely unaware of what she’s doing. Yet I have a feeling that you’ve already remonstrated with her, trying to convince her that she’s misinterpreting your actions, asking her what else you can do to make her happy and secure. If I am wrong, and you haven’t, then please do so. It will work wonders for your relationship. However, if I am right about your having made countless attempts to set her straight to no effect, then let’s be realistic, ok? She won’t change, dearest Edwin. At least, not at this time, and certainly not for you. At least… I hope not for you, because the best thing is to leave here and now. As soon as possible. Think about it, Edwin. Let’s change genders for a second. If you were a woman writing this about your boyfriend, it would be so clear what he was doing: questioning whether what you knew about love was false, preferring silence because that way you would never make a mistake, initiating nothing because you never knew what would set him off. If we imagined a man doing all this instead of your girlfriend, it would be clear he was an abuser. It is sometimes difficult to see it when genders are reversed because men being the abusers and women the abused is what we have come to expect. Some men might even feel flattered that they are the reason for such strong emotion, especially if they believe the antiquated notion that this sort of jealousy means love (it doesn’t). So here you are, an emotionally battered man, who happily was not so completely under her thumb that even if you knew she would accuse you of “airing your dirty laundry” you still wrote us. Please leave her, Edwin. No, it would not be abandoning her. You are her boyfriend, not her therapist. If you do leave, then to quote my friend Erika, “It is not only a bullet you dodged, it’s a bazooka!” Best wishes, MG Holmes – Rappler.com",True,true,[Two Pronged] My girlfriend’s constant jealousy is taking a toll on me,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/two-pronged-girlfriend-jealousy-taking-toll/,Rappler
"Not many people know that the Philippines’ economic managers come up with a yearly document called the Fiscal Risks Statement. It’s the government’s attempt to tell the public of things that could go wrong with the country’s finances. If you look at the document for 2025, written in 2024, there was no mention at all of corruption. I’m expecting the document for 2026 will at least get to mention that. But it was already apparent among the economic managers (speaking collectively) that there were red flags that could erode the country’s fiscal space. The most striking thing is that they already flagged the ballooning of unprogrammed appropriations. They said, “In the years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the GAA (General Appropriations Act) levels for UAs (Unprogrammed Appropriations) remained unchanged from their National Expenditure Program (NEP) levels. It was only in 2022 and the years thereafter that GAA levels began to deviate from NEP levels…” This is a refreshingly honest take, something you won’t normally hear from the economic managers in press conferences, but totally in line with my own analysis last year. In particular, the economic managers worried that more and more foreign-assisted projects (FAPs) were being dumped into unprogrammed funds. They said that if this continues, it “may lead to a slowdown in the implementation of FAPs and result in higher commitment fees and/or charges, as well as necessarily increase the NG’s (national government) deficit by as much as P181.8 billion…” Also, we should expect more delays: there’s “greater risk to the timely implementation of FAPs (foreign-assisted projects) considering that these usually cover pre-implementation activities. With this, the agency will be forced to restructure their work plans and targets which will result in a prolonged implementation period.” A good example of this is the Metro Manila Subway. When I checked the budget documents starting in 2020, the Metro Manila Subway (Phase 1) has been put in unprogrammed funds every year since the 2021. No wonder it’s delayed: from an initial partial opening in 2027, the Subway will be pushed back to 2032. Another red flag in the Fiscal Risks Statement is the ballooning of pensions for military and uniformed personnel (MUPs). They noted that the government owed in 2023 about P14 trillion in unpaid MUP pensions. That’s nearly thrice the total national budget for that year! The economic managers said, “It must be reiterated that currently, the pension system is fully dependent on government funding, posing not only a substantial risk to the fiscal position of the NG but also to the pension system itself considering that any fiscal and/or economic shock affecting the NG would directly impact the pensions and retirement benefits doled out to MUPs.” (EXPLAINER: How generous military pension is pushing Philippines to fiscal collapse) Recall that the Department of Finance, under former secretary Benjamin Diokno, tried to push for MUP pension reforms. Cielo Magno, my colleague at the UP School of Economics, was at the forefront of this reform before she was let go of by the Marcos administration. But MUP pension reforms stalled when Ralph Recto took over, and God knows whether Frederick Go, the new finance chief, will be bold enough to revisit these much-needed reforms. We can’t just kick the can down the road. Then there’s the age-old problem of underspending, or the government being unable to fully use up the money it’s allowed to spend. The Fiscal Risks Statement explained that the reasons for underspending (or even overspending in some instances) include “the efficiency of agencies in executing their programs and projects, as well as risk events such as weather disturbances, external developments, supply chain disruptions…” The spending ban earlier this year due to the elections was also a factor. The Department of Health (DOH) divulged earlier this budget season that only 200 of the country’s 600 health centers were operational. The reason is that many local government units failed to hire personnel (like nurses and doctors) for these centers. One lawmaker explained, “These are not ghost projects. They exist, but…they are not functioning.” Indeed, underspending happens at both the national and local levels. Unless this is addressed, much funding in the government will either be corrupted (there’s no underspending in corrupt public works, as we know now) or simply returned to the treasury. The Fiscal Risks Statement also highlighted problems with mounting debt. It warned that poorer revenue collections and “weaker-than-expected growth” will put pressure on the government to borrow even more, and this won’t help reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio. There are many reasons to worry about this. As I wrote on November 14, the 4% growth rate in the third quarter of 2025 turned out to be a shocker. Slow growth means that it will be harder to repay our outstanding debt. I expect economic growth to pick up in the fourth quarter (because of the holiday season) but don’t expect it to rescue the entire year’s growth performance. To reach the government’s lower target of 5.5%, we’ll need 7% growth — a moonshot. In conclusion, I wonder what the 2026 version of the Fiscal Risks Statement will say. At any rate, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. could step up reforms to address all these risks to the country’s finances. These days, though, he’s too busy playing politics. One could even say that the President himself, alongside some members of the economic team, are part of the fiscal risks, too, if we’re going to be honest. President Marcos, since he’s the one who signed off on the bloated national budgets and turned a blind eye on the budget shenanigans since 2022. Former finance chief Ralph Recto, since he’s the one who took money from PhilHealth and the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation to fund items in unprogrammed funds. And former budget chief Amenah Pangandaman, since she’s the one who crafted the proposed budget and allowed massive insertions without batting an eyelash. In short, the government has been shooting itself in the foot, but just won’t admit it. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of False Nostalgia: The Marcos “Golden Age” Myths and How to Debunk Them.

"MANILA, Philippines – Aiming to put the best of the Philippines under one grand structure, the country did that and more. The Philippine Pavilion received the Silver Award for Exhibition Design at the World Expo 2025 in Osaka, Japan, as Filipinos showcased their ingenuity in the unique structure featuring traditional weaves, culinary showcases, live performances, and a multisensory experience of AI-powered installations. “From the very beginning, when this was just an idea drawn on paper, we knew that the Philippine Pavilion was going to be more than just a physical structure. It was going to be our nation’s heartbeat at Expo 2025 — a living expression of who we are: strong, creative, and bound by community,” said Tourism Secretary Christina Garcia Frasco. The Bureau International des Expositions, the organizer of World Expos, presented the award honoring self-built pavilions under 1,500 square meters that demonstrate outstanding exhibit design and storytelling. It is held every five years, aiming to promote a society where the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals are achieved. The Pavilion, following the theme “Nature, Culture and Community — Woven Together for a Better Future,” featured over 200 handwoven panels crafted by Filipino weaving communities from 18 regions all over the country. Its creation is considered one of the biggest collaborations of this kind. Inside the grand structure, there are also 18 large-scale handwoven art pieces, along with a generative algorithm-powered “Dancing with Nature” experience, AI photobooths, Habi Shop, and the Hilot wellness corner. For six months, the exhibit welcomed over 1.1 million visitors, serving as a platform for the country’s creativity, craftsmanship, and commitment to sustainability and community, while also providing guests an immersive journey into Philippine nature, culture, and healing traditions. Frasco said the Philippines did more than “just build a Pavilion” in the Osaka Expo that featured 158 countries and regions. “We built pride. We built hope. We built a home for the Filipino spirit — here in Japan, and in the eyes of the world,” said Frasco. The space also fostered cultural diplomacy, trade networking, and tourism promotion, with initiatives such as the Philippine National Day festivities, MICE roadshow, and investor meetings. In building the Pavilion, the Philippines’ also hopes to strengthen ties with Japan, one of the country’s top tourism and trade partners, through collaboration with Japanese prefectures, travel agencies, media, and cultural institutions. Fortunately, the Pavilion does not end with Expo 2025 as some of its elements will be brought to the National Museum of the Philippines and select regional sites. There are also plans to use parts of the Pavilion in the upcoming ASEAN Tourism Forum and Travex, to be held in Cebu in January 2026. “What we created here was both a space and a feeling — of warmth, of welcome, of wonder. And we carry that spirit home with us,” said Margarita Montemayor Nograles, Tourism Promotions Board Philippines chief operating officer and the Philippine Organizing Committee secretary-general. “Through the Pavilion, we invited the world to rediscover the Philippines — and we thank every visitor who answered that invitation.” – Alyana Fabella/Rappler.com Alyana Fabella is a Rappler intern studying Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the Ateneo de Manila University.",True,true,"Philippine Pavilion dazzles at World Expo 2025, earns Silver Award",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/philippine-pavilion-world-expo-2025-silver-award-osaka-japan/,Rappler
"The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has ordered a temporary suspension of its field audit operations nationwide, a directive formalized under Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 107-2025, issued on November 24, 2025. This move, initiated under the leadership of the new BIR Commissioner, Charlito Martin R. Mendoza, is an institutional response to concerns regarding the integrity and fairness of the tax audit process. Understanding this suspension and its implications is vital for maintaining proactive tax risk management. The primary objective of the audit suspension under RMC 107‑2025 is to enable the BIR to implement a more comprehensive internal review of its tax audit policies and procedures, strengthen internal safeguards, and ensure that the issuance of Letters of Authority (LOAs) and Mission Orders (MOs) follows the rule of law, advancing the protection of taxpayer rights. Unlike the annual “Stop Audit,” which was a fixed, short-term pause mostly affecting routine audits, the current suspension was implemented earlier, includes stronger internal controls, covers both new and ongoing audits, and will remain in effect until lifted by the Commissioner. It is crucial to note that RMC No. 107-2025 does not constitute a total freeze on all BIR examinations. The following critical and time-sensitive operations are explicitly excluded and will proceed: While the temporary suspension alleviates immediate audit pressure, the expectation is that the ensuing audit system will be more stringent and standardized. Therefore, businesses should use this period for critical internal preparation. The BIR’s directive presents an opportunity for the Bureau to implement procedural reforms and for taxpayers to reinforce their internal controls and compliance posture. – Rappler.com",True,true,[Ask the Tax Whiz] Temporary suspension of BIR audit: Are you affected?,https://www.rappler.com/business/ask-the-tax-whiz-things-to-know-temporary-suspension-bir-audit/,Rappler
"CAIRO, Egypt – Egyptian officials are hoping the inauguration of a vast new museum on Saturday will accelerate the revival of a tourism industry hampered for more than a decade by internal upheaval, a pandemic and regional conflicts. Officials believe the Grand Egyptian Museum, or GEM, alone could draw as many as 7 million additional visitors annually after it opens on Saturday, helping boost total visitors to around 30 million by 2030. Overlooking the Giza Pyramids, the 500,000-square-meter edifice will house tens of thousands of artifacts, including what is billed as the complete collection of the treasures of the boy-king Tutankhamun, many displayed for the first time. The new space includes immersive exhibits and virtual-reality devices, in contrast to cluttered, old-fashioned displays in the older Egyptian Museum in downtown Cairo. Egypt, which has needed repeated bailouts to stabilize its economy, uses the foreign currency it collects from tourism to pay for crucial imports such as fuel and wheat. Last year, the country drew 15.7 million visitors who spent a record $15 billion, according to official figures. Tourism had collapsed to a low of $3.8 billion in 2015/16, the victim of extended political turmoil after Egypt’s 2011 uprising. However, factors including fraying infrastructure, poor planning and security restrictions have held back the tourism sector’s potential. Even with the recent recovery, Egypt trails regional rival Turkey, which said it had more than 50 million international visitors last year, bringing in over $60 billion. Ghada Abdelmoaty, an associate professor at the Higher Institute of Tourism and Hotels in Alexandria, said visitor targets were realistic. “The museum accommodates a huge collection that was previously kept in storage due to lack of display space,” she said. Popular with many travelers for its Red Sea resorts, Egypt hopes the GEM’s opening will also draw an increasing proportion of cultural tourists. Such tourists typically stay longer and spend more than those who come mainly for beaches, analysts say. Official figures don’t say how many tourists come for cultural reasons, but a 2021 study of GEM’s possible impact estimated they made up less than a quarter of the total. Abdelmoaty put the number of cultural tourists at only 10-15% of all international travelers. Remon Naguib, chief commercial officer at Orient Hospitality Group, said his company was working to integrate the new museum into “joint programs” designed to attract visitors to experience both. Tourists could “come and visit the museum, then spend three nights in a Red Sea destination, including Ain Sukhna, which is just one hour from Cairo,” he said. Tourism revenues became even more important over the last two years as attacks on Red Sea shipping chased shipping away from the Suez Canal, another major foreign currency earner. Tourism itself has proven vulnerable to shocks including political violence in the 1990s and 2000s, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine – two countries which accounted for nearly a third of tourist arrivals in 2021. Tourism has also been hurt by the war in Gaza. To fully capitalize on the GEM’s opening, the museum “has to be complemented by very high-quality tourist infrastructure – hotels, transport, and beyond,” said Ragui Assaad, professor of international economic policy at the University of Minnesota. That means addressing issues like transport in Cairo, a megacity with an estimated population of 23 million. Roads leading to the new museum have been given a facelift, while a new airport has been built about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the GEM to circumvent clogged streets. Entrance to the Giza Pyramids has been relocated to the back side to reduce crowding and keep visitors away from the area’s famously aggressive tourist touts. Tourism Minister Sherif Fathy said last month Egypt had added 5,000 hotel rooms to its existing 235,000 and hoped to add yet another 9,000 before the year ends. – Rappler.com",True,true,Egypt hopes new museum by the Pyramids will revive tourism,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/egypt-new-museum-pyramids-revive-tourism/,Rappler
"MANILA Philippines – Now that the Bounty Fresh Group is behind The Bistro Group, what’s next for the Philippines’ leading premium casual restaurant operator? Tennyson Chen, chairman of Bounty Fresh Group Holdings, identified four of The Bistro Group’s 26 brands that will be prioritized for expansion: These are four restaurant brands that The Bistro Group’s new owners no longer have to pay royalties for. “Obviously, we would like to scale up our own brand…[those] that we own already,” Chen recently told the ABS-CBN News Channel’s show Banker After Dark following their acquisition of the minority stake of legacy firm Anscor in The Bistro Group. “These [four] are the brands we’d like to scale up over time.” He disclosed that they recently bought Italianni’s Philippines from its master franchisor, which gives them more leeway to expand the brand. “Obviously, the multiple of a franchise company which you pay royalty to is much lower…[than] if you own the brand,” Chen added, citing the case of their roasted chicken retail chain, Chooks-to-Go. “Like, if we go to the market, like Chooks, the multiple will be higher than if we go to the market [with] like Bistro.” He said they plan to scale up The Bistro Group around three times in the next five years or so, similar to how private equity firm Navegar, led by its co-founder and managing partner Nori Poblador, did it after investing in The Bistro Group over a decade ago. Navegar, an investment firm focusing on Philippine companies, bought a controlling stake in The Bistro Group in 2014 when it had by then around 50 restaurants. Navegar’s sale of its majority stake in The Bistro Group to the Chen family’s investment firm, Inoza Business Holdings, was approved by the Philippine Competition Commission last August. Chen said they considered buying The Bistro Group in 2017, but decided against it since they were still focused on growing their roasted chicken business. Now that their Chooks-to-Go and Uling Roasters chains are nationwide with more than 1,800 outlets, Chen said they decided to “go for it” and buy The Bistro Group this year to add “prestige to our [Bounty] brand.” A post shared by Chooks-to-Go (@chooks_ph) The Bounty Fresh Group is a fully integrated poultry company engaged in contract growing, contract breeding, and fresh chicken reselling (Bounty Fresh products), among other agribusinesses. Chen paid tribute to The Bistro Group’s human resources, particularly its “good management team” whose managers often “work up to late at night.” “The people behind it are the gems that will drive the business further,” he said. The Bistro Group started in the Philippines over 30 years ago when entrepreneur William “Bill” Stelton brought the American casual restaurant TGI Friday’s, opening his first store at Glorietta, Makati City, in 1994. It now has over 225 stores in key cities nationwide. It is led by Stelton as chairman and chief executive officer, and its president Jean Paul Manuud. The Bistro Group’s latest restaurant opening is Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chão at Glorietta last September. In October, the first American sports bar-restaurant Dave and Buster’s in the Philippines will open at the Gokongweis’ premium mall, Opus. The Bistro Group also recently revived La Lola Churrerria, which sells authentic Spanish-style churros. A post shared by Dave & Buster's Philippines (@daveandbustersph) Chen said they plan to introduce new technologies such as artificial intelligence and a centralized kitchen in running The Bistro Group, which would mean higher productivity and cost savings that will redound to its employees and to the group’s customers. – Rappler.com",True,true,"With new owner Bounty, what’s next for The Bistro Group?",https://www.rappler.com/business/bounty-fresh-plans-bistro-group-restaurants-expansion/,Rappler
"LONDON, United Kingdom – Global oil and gas demand could grow until 2050, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday, November 12, departing from previous expectations of a speedy transition to cleaner fuels following US criticism about its climate focus. The Paris-based energy security watchdog also predicted in its annual outlook that the world will likely fail to meet its goal to cap the rise in temperatures to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change. The IEA has been under pressure from the US for a shift in recent years toward a focus on clean energy policies as President Donald Trump called on American companies to expand oil and gas production. During the Biden administration, it predicted that global oil demand would peak this decade and said there should be an end to investment in new oil, gas and coal projects if the world wanted to reach net zero emissions by mid-century. (COP30: UN Climate Change Conference agenda, latest news) Trump’s Energy Secretary Chris Wright has called its demand peak projections “nonsensical.” The IEA is funded by member countries, with the US the largest contributor. In its World Energy Outlook published on Wednesday the IEA predicted under a current policies scenario that oil demand will hit 113 million barrels per day by mid-century, up around 13% from 2024 consumption. It predicted that global energy demand will climb by 90 exajoules by 2035 — a 15% increase from present levels. The scenario, which the IEA first used in 2019 before switching to one more in line with a clean energy transition, is based on existing government policies and not aspirations to achieve climate goals. IEA head Fatih Birol said on a press call the scenario was restored to reflect differing choices governments are making about energy. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has previously disputed peak oil demand forecasts. “We hope…we have passed the peak in the misguided notion of ‘peak oil.’” OPEC said on its website on Wednesday. This year’s outlook ditched the pledges scenario as the IEA said not enough countries had submitted new commitments to produce a meaningful picture. In the stated policies scenario, which considers proposed but not necessarily adopted policies, oil demand peaks around 2030. The difference in projections is largely due to diverging expectations of EV uptake. The IEA says its scenarios explore a range of possible outcomes under various sets of assumptions and are not forecasts. Final investment decisions for new liquefied natural gas projects have surged in 2025, the report noted. Operations for about 300 billion cubic metres of new annual LNG export capacity will start by 2030, marking a 50% increase in available supply. Based on the current policies scenario, the global LNG market increases from around 560 bcm in 2024 to 880 bcm in 2035 and to 1,020 bcm in 2050, driven by rising power sector demand fueled by data center and AI growth. Global investment in data centers is expected to reach $580 billion in 2025, the report said, noting that if achieved this would surpass the $540 billion a year spent globally on oil supply. The report includes a scenario describing a pathway to reduce global energy emissions to net zero by 2050. More than 190 countries pledged at the Paris climate talks in 2015 to try to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. The report shows the world surpassing that in all scenarios. “We need to speed up and scale up and governments at COP30 must now agree on a global response plan to urgently bridge the 1.5ºC ambition gap,” Kaisa Kosonen, senior policy adviser at Greenpeace Nordic said, referring to the UN climate talks underway in Brazil. – Rappler.com",True,true,"World oil and gas demand could grow until 2050, IEA says",https://www.rappler.com/business/world-oil-gas-demand-grow-until-2050-report/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Fashion designer and beauty queen Veejay Floresca just made her-story as the first Filipino openly transgender woman to win Project Runway! Floresca was crowned the season 21 winner of the reality design competition on Friday, September 26, during the finale livestreamed on Disney+, Hulu, and Freeform. Floresca showcased her winning collection titled A Beautiful Moment, a name inspired by a movie that she and her father used to watch. “After my dad’s passing, I made a promise to take his role and become the breadwinner of the family. This moment is just the perfect moment to honor him,” she said. The winning set featured silver, gray, and black pieces that served as an epitome of craftsmanship, versatility, and an elevated level of imagination that the artist embodied throughout the series. “My collection represents me as a designer because it’s very innovative, it’s modern. I think it’s the right balance of concept and wearability,” the designer described. Although judges Heidi Klum, ELLE Magazine editor-in-chief Nina Garcia, image architect Law Roach, and fashion icon Michael Kors had different favorites from the collection, they all agreed to commend the variety and distinctiveness that Floresca presented. “This is surprising in a very good way, and she delivered!” Garcia remarked. Born and raised in the Philippines, Floresca is a proud trans woman who has been open in sharing her story as a queer and uses her platform to advocate for rights against discrimination and protection for the members of the LGBTQIA+ community. In college, she received a full scholarship at De La Salle–College of Saint Benilde, where she took up a degree in Fashion Design and Merchandising and graduated cum laude. She then moved to London to finish an associate degree in Bridalwear at Central Saint Martins. In 2012, she expanded her knowledge in design by taking her master’s degree in Fashion at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. Establishing her career in the industry, Floresca started her own bridalwear brand in 2013, which she named after her mother, Madore. She also produced her own ready-to-wear clothing line named FOUR28, a nod to her birthday. Floresca made her first nationwide mark in 2008, when she joined the first Project Runway Philippines. She finished as one of the top three. By 2013, she had been given multiple international recognitions from Japan, China, France, and the USA. Aside from fashion, Floresca is also an avid fan of beauty pageants and was allowed to represent the Philippines in the 2022 Miss Trans Star International pageant, where she finished in the top 16. Despite the many accolades under her belt, joining Project Runway has been her biggest dream. In social media, she revealed that she had auditioned for every season of the show, and after 21 years of waiting, she has finally fulfilled her dream. “I patiently waited for 21 years to finally be part of this iconic show. I auditioned every season and was rejected many times, but I told myself to never give up and to keep applying, because one day I would have the opportunity to show my passion,” she expressed. Floresca is the fourth designer of Filipino descent on the show, following Ysabel Hilado in season 1 and Kenneth Barlis and Darren Apolonio, who are both from season 19. Project Runway is a reality competition where fashion designers battle in different themed challenges by creating unique looks with various garments and styles. The designer with the “weakest look,” according to the judges, is eliminated every week until one is named the winner.

On Wednesday, September 24, Padilla filed Senate Bill No. 2810, which seeks to amend the Safe Spaces Act of 2019 with heavier penalties, as well as increasing the prescriptive period for filing a complaint from the current five years to 10 years. Padilla, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Public Information and Mass Media, cited that the committee’s recent hearings on the policies of television networks and artist management agencies in relation to complaints of sexual abuse and harassment have found that the “sexual harassment in the workplace remains active and rampant.” “It was further observed that employers, particularly large corporations, could easily evade compliance with their obligations under the Safe Spaces Act given the grossly small amount of applicable fines,” Padilla said in his bill. Among the amendments that Padilla proposed in SB 2810 include: This is the third and latest bill that Padilla filed following the committee’s series of hearings on sexual harassment cases in the entertainment industry. The probe led by Padilla was launched following the reported sexual harassment incident involving actor Sandro Muhlach. In August, Padilla filed Senate Bill No. 2777, which seeks to make sexual assault punishable by reclusion perpetua to the death penalty for cases with aggravating circumstances, regardless of the gender of the offender. He also filed Senate Bill No. 2778 which aims to professionalize the talent management industry and require licenses for talent managers and companies. Padilla also mentioned during the Wednesday hearing that the Senate Committee on Public Information and Mass Media has decided to cancel the Senate probe on Muhlach’s case to stop sensationalizing the issue. “Pero siyempre, hindi po natin isinasantabi ang mga reklamong ito. Tayo po ay nakapaglinaw ng mga panukala para sagutin po, ito na po ang magiging panangga… Ito na po ang magiging sandigan ninyo kung ito po ay magiging batas,” Padilla said. (But of course, we won’t put aside the complaints. We were able to set clear amendments, which will be our shield. We can lean on these if these amendments lapse into law.) On August 19, Muhlach filed a complaint of rape through sexual assault against GMA independent contractors Jojo Nones and Richard Cruz at the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). On August 30, the Sparkle actor also filed a cyber libel complaint against several netizens at NBI. — Rappler.com",True,true,Padilla files bill seeking stricter penalties under Bawal Bastos act,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/robin-padilla-bill-stricter-penalties-bawal-bastos-act/,Rappler
"BENGALURU, India – At a startup office in this Indian city, developers are fine-tuning artificial intelligence chatbots that talk and message like humans. The company, LimeChat, has an audacious goal: to make customer-service jobs almost obsolete. It says its generative AI agents enable clients to slash by 80% the number of workers needed to handle 10,000 monthly queries. “Once you hire a LimeChat agent, you never have to hire again,” Nikhil Gupta, its 28-year-old co-founder, told Reuters. Cheap labor and English proficiency helped make India the world’s back office — sometimes at the expense of workers elsewhere. Now, AI-powered systems are subsuming jobs done by headset-wearing graduates in technical support, customer care, and data management, sparking a scramble to adapt, a Reuters examination found. That’s driving business for AI startups that help companies slash staffing costs and scale operations — even though many consumers still prefer to deal with a person. This account of the disruptive changes transforming India’s $283 billion IT sector is based on interviews with 30 people, including industry executives, recruiters, workers and current and former government officials. Reuters also visited two AI startups and tested voice and text chatbots that handle increasingly sophisticated customer interactions in human-like ways. Rather than pump the brakes as the technology threatens jobs built on routine tasks, the country is accelerating, wagering that a let-it-rip approach will create enough new opportunities to absorb those displaced, Reuters found. The outcome of India’s gamble carries weight far beyond its borders — a test case for whether embracing AI-driven disruption can elevate a developing economy or render it a cautionary tale. The global conversational AI market is growing 24% a year and should reach $41 billion by 2030, consultancy Grand View Research estimates. India — which relies on IT for 7.5% of its GDP — is leaning in. In a February speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said “work does not disappear due to technology. Its nature changes and new types of jobs are created.” Not everyone shares Modi’s confidence in India’s preparedness. Santosh Mehrotra, a former Indian official and visiting professor at the University of Bath’s Centre for Development Studies, criticized the government for a lack of urgency in assessing AI’s effects on India’s young workforce. “There’s no gameplan,” he said. Business process management employs 1.65 million workers in call centers, payroll, and data handling in India. Hiring has plummeted due to increased automation and digitalization, despite rising demand for AI coordinators and process analysts, said Neeti Sharma, CEO of staffing firm TeamLease Digital. Net headcount in the segment, which represents one-fifth of IT output, grew by fewer than 17,000 workers in each of the past two years, down from 130,000 in 2022-2023 and 177,000 in 2021-2022, TeamLease Digital figures show. Reuters spoke to three current and five former customer-service workers, who described increasing job insecurity and integration of AI, including tools that suggest responses and bots that handle nearly all routine queries autonomously. Megha S., 32, was earning $10,000 a year at a Bengaluru-based software solutions provider. She said she was laid off last month, just before India’s festive season, as the company moved to implement AI tools to review the quality of sales calls. “I was told I am the first one who has been replaced by AI,” said Megha, who spoke on the condition that her full name and former employer not be identified. “I’ve not told my parents.” Sumita Dawra, a former labor ministry secretary who oversaw an Indian government taskforce on AI’s impact on the workforce before retiring in March, said while the technology offered productivity gains that would lead to new jobs, India could consider stronger social security measures, such as unemployment benefits, to help those displaced during the transition. However, a senior Indian official told Reuters the government believed AI would ultimately have little impact on overall employment. India’s IT and labor ministries, and Modi’s office, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Besides AI, factors clouding the outlook for India’s IT sector include US tariffs; a proposal by a US lawmaker for a 25% tax on firms using foreign outsourcing services; and President Trump’s $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas, which are widely used by tech firms to sponsor Indian workers. Investment bank Jefferies predicted in September that India’s call centers would face a revenue hit of 50% — and around 35% for other back-office functions — from AI adoption over the next five years. That would spell near-term job losses in India, which accounts for 52% of the global outsourcing market. “The biggest impact is going to be on young students coming out of college,” said Pramod Bhasin, who in the 1990s established India’s first call center with 18 employees for GE Capital, where workstations were partitioned by saris strung from the ceiling. In the longer run, India could transition from “back office” to the world’s “AI factory” by capitalizing on demand for AI engineers and automation deployment, said Bhasin, who went on to found IT services firm Genpact. One beneficiary of that demand is LimeChat, which Reuters visited in August. Gupta, the co-founder, said his developers and engineers have helped automate 5,000 jobs across India. The company’s bots handle 70% of customer complaints for its clients, and it plans to achieve 90-95% within a year, he said. “If you’re giving us 100,000 rupees per month, you are automating the job of at least 15 agents,” said Gupta. At that price — about $1,130 — the service costs roughly the same as three customer-care staff, he said. LimeChat’s sales soared to $1.5 million in 2024 from $79,000 two years earlier, regulatory disclosures show. Last year, the firm began integrating Microsoft’s Azure language models and algorithms in a partnership to launch a new e-commerce chatbot. Among Gupta’s clients is Indian ayurvedic products firm Kapiva, which has deployed a LimeChat bot for customer interactions over WhatsApp. Keying in a prompt — “What kind of diet should I have to reduce weight?” — yielded an AI meal-plan creator. A follow-up query in English and Hindi about how a slimming juice differs from another item was also answered, with the chatbot eventually sharing links to Kapiva products with a smiling emoji. Kapiva didn’t respond to Reuters questions. LimeChat’s rivals include Reliance, the conglomerate chaired by Mukesh Ambani, which acquired Indian startup Haptik in 2019. Haptik says it offers “AI agents that deliver human-like customer experiences” that cost $120 and can cut support costs by 30%. Revenue skyrocketed to almost $18 million last year from less than $1 million in 2020, disclosures show. Haptik promoted a webinar in September by posing the question: “What if you had a full-time employee who never sleeps and costs just 10,000 rupees?” “We are seeing a huge shift,” Haptik product manager Suji Ravi said in the webinar, which Reuters reporters attended. “Brands are not investing in human agents and they want to deploy AI agents.” For LimeChat client Mamaearth, an Indian personal-care brand, the main attraction of AI chatbots is scalability, said Vipul Maheshwari, head of product and analytics at parent firm Honasa Consumer. “Providing good customer support is make or break for us,” he said. “But can we infinitely scale my customer support team? Absolutely not.” The chatbot used by Mamaearth could go beyond simple assistance like order tracking, and help users with queries such as recommending the right products during pregnancy or, in some cases, handle an agitated customer, Maheshwari said. The promise and perils of AI are evident at The Media Ant. The Bengaluru-based advertising agency cut 40% of its workforce to about 100 over the past year and vacated space in another building to save on rent, said founder Samir Chaudhary. The firm eliminated 15 salespeople, replacing them with AI bots that identify leads and send emails to prospective customers, Chaudhary said. A six-member call center was replaced with a voice agent called Neha that speaks in near-flawless, Indian-accented English. When a Reuters reporter asked Neha about advertising on YouTube, she sought details about the budget and target markets, noted the requirements, and ended the conversation cheerfully: “I will email you the details … have a great day.” “Ask her out for a coffee and she will laugh it off,” Chaudhary said. Yet the race to embrace AI isn’t always smooth for companies. Take Sweden’s Klarna. Chatbots helped the fintech firm cut thousands of jobs last year, but its CEO told Reuters in September the company is now “trying to course correct” and use the technology to improve products rather than reduce costs. Chatbots have limitations. While most generic e-commerce-related queries posed by a Reuters reporter were handled well by LimeChat bots, some stumped them. When LimeChat client Knya’s bot was asked for proof of its claim that a million medical professionals trust its products, such as its stethoscopes, it replied: “I am sorry, I don’t have enough information to answer your question.” Knya didn’t respond to a request for comment. Customer surveys show chatbots are still disliked by many. An August 2024 EY survey of 1,000 Indian consumers found 62% made purchases influenced by AI recommendations, compared with 30% globally. Yet, “the desire for a human connection remains strong,” EY noted, with 78% preferring online platforms that provide human support. LimeChat’s Gupta, though, said well-trained AI agents could resolve queries faster than humans. He said many standard bots pass conversations to a human agent when they encounter angry customers: “You need a very small number of people to just handle negative experiences.” In the 1990s and 2000s, India’s tech boom fueled rural-to-urban migration. Cities like Bengaluru became outsourcing hubs as domestic firms, including Tata Consultancy Services TCS.NS, Infosys INFY.NS and Wipro WIPR.NS, grew into global juggernauts. That expansion trickled through to Ameerpet, a Hyderabad neighborhood where university graduates fill classrooms to learn IT skills and earn certifications for tech jobs. Ameerpet’s training centers traditionally offered courses in Microsoft Office and programming languages like Java. Visiting in April, Reuters found these centers are increasingly focused on AI training. Outside one, Quality Thought, a banner featured a robot overlooking a globe with the letters “AI.” The center was offering a nine-month course in AI data science and prompt engineering for about $1,360, more than double the price of a traditional web-development program. “Recruiters are asking for students with basic AI skills,” staffer Priyanka Kandulapati said. “We are going to streamline our courses even further to suit the demand.” In a discussion with startup founders last month about the pace of change, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, who co-founded Sun Microsystems, offered a stark view of the future for India. “All IT services will be replaced in the next five years,” he said. “It’s going to be pretty chaotic.” – Rappler.com",True,true,Meet the AI chatbots replacing India’s call center workers,https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/ai-chatbots-replace-india-call-center-workers/,Rappler
"MANILA, Philippines – Ayala Land Incorporated (ALI) has sold its 50% ownership of Alabang Commercial Center to the Madrigal family for P13.5 billion. (READ: Jamby Madrigal: Unafraid to pick a fight) The Alabang Commercial Center Corporation owns and operates Alabang Town Center, a pioneer mall in Muntinlupa City, south of Manila. In a disclosure on Tuesday, December 16, the Zobel de Ayalas’ property company said the share purchase agreement was with its existing joint venture partner and is subject to customary closing conditions. ALI said the Madrigals made an unsolicited offer which “provided a premium, allowing ALI to recognize gains from the sale and monetize its stake in Alabang Town Center.” It added that “proceeds from the sale will fuel further growth” in its “leasing portfolio and provide our stakeholders with return of capital.” In a disclosure on Wednesday, December 17, Ayala Land identified the buyer of all of its shares in Alabang Commercial Corporation as Francisco Madrigal Bayot Jr. Meantime, the Lopez-owned Rockwell Land Corporation confirmed on Wednesday that it was in talks with “one of the Madrigals” to redevelop the Alabang Town Center. It said this was “in line with Rockwell Land’s continuous search for properties to develop.” In the early 1970s, the Madrigal family offered to sell a big tract of land in Alabang to Ayala Corporation, then headed by Enrique Zobel. The two groups decided on a joint venture to develop the 661-hectare agricultural land into a residential-commercial district. (TRIVIA: What some of the richest Filipinos have in common) The area now houses the Alabang Town Center, Ayala Alabang Village, and the Madrigal Business Center District, an area considered to be a symbol of progress and prosperity south of the capital.

"Filipinos often play around with words and use sexual innuendo when referring to food, and our ubiquitous rice cakes, which are daily fare, bear this out. “Bibingka” (AKA bingka), or baked rice cake, is used as a naughty reference to female genitalia. Decades ago, when out with friends, flirting, doing casual hook-ups, if one in the group catches the eye of someone else, we’d joke, “Aba, ang benta ng bingka mo,” (Hmm, your bingka is a best seller) which would send the group into peals of laughter. While “puto” (steamed rice cakes), are most likely an adaptation of the Malaysian word “puttu” (“portion”), others claim that the term refers to the male version of “puta” (whore, homosexual), a derogatory term in Spanish. Then there is the more explicitly named “monay” bread, with its characteristic shape. Perhaps these terms are ways of reacting to sexual repressions imposed by religion and society. But anyway, coded language, alliteration, double-entendre, and subversion of the terms all make them hilarious. Puto, the steamed, slightly fermented rice cakes, mixed with coconut milk and sugar, are common in all parts of the country. And Iloilo has several distinct versions. One type has banana leaf as base, smooth, sweetish, and part of it would stick to the leaf, which I’d often scape off using fingers and tongue. This is “puto Manapla,” presumably because of its origins in Manapla town in Negros Occidental. Another type, slightly grainier in texture, has a touch of coconut milk; both were often vended door-to-door in the mornings. Later, another popular version cropped up, which was produced in Santa Cruz street in Villa, and named after the owner. Ted’s rice puto was smaller, shaped in a mold with ridges, was a bit heavier/dense. Ted said he always used a special type of rice — because other types would not just cut it. Unfortunately, Ted passed away recently, and his descendants no longer make it. I used to go biking, looking at the sign outside his little home/shop, for the handwritten sign on a blackboard, which either read, “wala na puto” (No more puto) or, “May puto pa” — meaning, it had not yet sold out. Later, other variations were added by entrepreneurs: food colors – orange, green, purple; a sliver of cheese, a minute piece of ground pork, and these were christened “cheese pao,” ‘ube pao” and “puto pao” (from the chinese siopao, or steamed bun). Another popular iteration is a bunch of three puto wrapped in banana leaf, or “puto sa dahon;” some call this “puto likit.” Sellers say it is actually made in Guimaras island, or in some parts of Pavia town. All these types of puto go well with savory soups such as La Paz batchoy or with dinuguan, a pork blood-and-entrails stew. One other version of puto, is made of malagkit (sticky rice) and taro (ube), with coconut strips; it is purple and is gooey, finger-stickingly good; this is known as “puto tikoy.” During the Christmas holidays, “puto bumbong,” an import from Luzon, is popular; it has a characteristic tube shape, violet color, and topped with shredded coconut and muscovado sugar. In an effort to attract more youthful buyers, some toppings now include grated cheese and condensed milk. Then there’s “puto lanson,” which is made of grated cassava, and said to have originated in Iloilo. This may be the only puto that does not have a grain of rice. The word “puto” is also sometimes used to mean “bankrupt” though how it became so is not clear. I would hear references to “daw na puto nga Intsik” (someone looking like a Chinaman who lost all his money, or perhaps, was literally “f*cked up”). Molo, my hometown and a former parian (chinese quarters) in the 18th to 19th century, was home to dozens of Chinese traders and mestizos, so this may have not been an uncommon sight then! “The many faces of bibingka” (2023), notes that the word “bibingka” may have originated from the chinese “bi” (uncooked rice). In some parts of Indonesia, a rice and coconut concoction very similar to the Ilonggo bibingka exists; while the Goan dessert, “bebinca” — almost identical in name, (said to be Indo-Portuguese in origin), has 7-16 layers, and is topped with almonds and nutmeg, is totally different from the Philippine bibingka. I had my first taste of an Ilonggo bibingka over six decades ago. On Sundays, Dad would take us to Villa beach for a swim. Villa back then had fine blackish-gray sand, gently sloping shores, with bamboo tables set out under coconut trees and sheds roofed with palm fronds, long before Breakthrough and Tatoy’s became bywords. We’d go for bingka on the way home. These thin, little rice cakes, made with rice flour, eggs, sugar, and shredded young coconut, would be cooked in a makeshift oven of flattened galvanized iron, with coals (wood, dry coconut husks) on top and below. The mixture would be ladled onto a little round mould cut from a tin can of evaporated milk, about an inch thick, and lined with banana leaf. Sometimes the edges would be a little burnt, making it “tostado,” which would be an additional treat for me. Years later, similar versions of this “Villa” bibingka would find its way to the other districts of Iloilo, around the plazas, in Molo, Mandurriao, and Jaro. Our neighbors, the Tacorda family, have a pop-up stall in the Molo plaza, and have been selling bingka for almost 50 years now. The next version of bibingka that I recall is a plumper, softer one, much more like a cake or mamon (muffin), with token coconut strips. This would be the classic “Bingka ni Neneng.” It could be topped with salted egg or cheese and would also have a banana leaf base. It would have a dab of margarine. These were popular pasalubong from Manila for a while, just for the novelty; in the ’80s it was even popularized in a song of the same name. This would be billed as “Royal Bibingka” as though to “elevate” it. Yet another version of the bibingka is made of balinghoy (cassava), and it would be called “cassava bibingka;” it would be more moist, often with a sweet caramelized topping. Then, there is Bingka sa Mohon — at the Mohon (boundary) of the city proper and Oton town; the barangay is of the same name. Mohon’s bingka is renowned for its larger size, rectangular shape, thicker and gooey texture, and lots of young coconut strands. This is sold in a homemade cardboard box, and literally goes like hotcakes, usually all gone before noon. The blog Flavours of Iloilo notes that Felicidad Animas first cooked this up in the 1950s, and the business remains with the family. This is my favorite of all the bingkas, and an ode to it is below: A discussion about Iloilo’s bibingkas extends beyond the city’s limits and would not be complete without mentioning a few more distinct versions — the bingka from Balasan (a northern Iloilo town), available in December up to the Jaro fiesta month (February) in the Jaro Plaza. Ilonggo food writer Joy Rosal describes the RCJ Balasan bibingka (after the initials of the family who originated it), as “distinct for the nicely glazed top and rich creamy inside, the right proportion of young coconut strands, glutinous rice, refined sugar, eggs and milk.” And, many others swear by Leling’s bingka of Sta. Barbara town, about 12 kms from the city, which has a puto-like texture but nicely browned with a slightly firmer top, thicker and topped with coconut strands. The persistence — and popularity of both puto and bibingka in Iloilo to this day, is part of its gastronomic heritage — the landscape and climate that grows rice, coconuts, and sugar abundantly. Furthermore, the innovations in using locally available material (banana leaf base, coconut husks for the fire, cassava, makeshift tin ovens and pans), and its inexpensive price, make it a truly local treat. Surely, “mabenta ang bingka asta san-o. (Bingka will be a best seller forever).” – Rappler.com",True,true,[Ilonggo Notes] Delicious and salacious Ilonggo bingka and puto,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/ilonggo-notes-bingka-puto/,Rappler
